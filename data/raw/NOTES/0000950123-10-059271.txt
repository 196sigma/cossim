Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data. The following discussion also contains trend
information and other forward looking statements that involve a
number of risks and uncertainties. The Risk Factors set forth in
Item1. Business are hereby incorporated into
the discussion by reference.   
36 Table of Contents   Overview   Revenues for fiscal 2010 were $39billion, up
$05billion, or 15%, from fiscal 2009. Improved revenue
performance in fiscal 2010 was the result of improvements in
product, software entitlements and maintenance and service
revenues. Revenues in fiscal 2009 were negatively impacted by a
$1287million settlement with the General Services
Administration GSA. The dispute regarded our discounting
practices and compliance with the price reduction provisions of
GSA contracts between August 1997 and February 2005.   Gross profit margins increased during fiscal 2010 due largely to
reductions in product materials cost, partially offset by a
decrease in the overall average selling prices of our products,
as well as an increase in our SEM and services revenues mix
relative to product revenues. In addition, our gross profit
margin in fiscal 2009 was negatively impacted by the GSA
settlement.   During fiscal 2010, sales and marketing, research and
development, and general and administrative expenses totaled
$21billion, up 10% from fiscal 2009 and reflected the
impact of an increase in incentive compensation and commissions
expense related to our stronger sales and operating profit
performance, as well as having 53weeks in fiscal 2010
compared to 52weeks in fiscal 2009.   During fiscal 2010, we entered into a merger agreement with Data
Domain, Inc., which was subsequently terminated on July8,
2009. In accordance with the agreement, we received a
$570million termination fee, which, when netted against
$159million of incremental third-party costs we incurred
relating to the terminated merger transaction, resulted in net
proceeds of $411million.   Critical
Accounting Estimates and Policies   Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations are based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. The preparation of such statements requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the
financial statements. Our estimates are based on historical
experience and other assumptions that we consider to be
appropriate in the circumstances. However, actual future results
may vary from our estimates.   We believe that the following accounting policies are
significantly affected by critical accounting estimates and that
they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial
condition and results and require difficult management judgments
and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.
Note2 of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements describes the significant accounting policies used in
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered
to be critical accounting policies.   We believe the accounting policies described below are the ones
that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments
and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results
of operations.   Revenue
Recognition, Reserves and Allowances   We apply the provisions of the accounting guidance for software
revenue recognition to our product sales, both hardware and
software, because our software is essential to the performance
of our hardware. We recognize revenue when   
Persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists:It is our customary practice to have a
purchase order
and/or
contract prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement from our
end users, customers, value-added resellers, or distributors.   
Delivery has occurred:Our product is
physically delivered to our customers, generally with standard
transfer terms such as FOB origin. We typically do not allow for
restocking rights with any of our value-added resellers or
distributors. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or
return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria
are achieved. If undelivered products or services exist that are
essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an
arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred.   
37 Table of Contents   
The fee is fixed or determinable:Arrangements
with payment terms extending beyond our standard terms,
conditions and practices are not considered to be fixed or
determinable. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized at
the earlier of customer payment or when the fees become due and
payable. We typically do not allow for price-protection rights
with any of our value-added resellers or distributors.   
Collection is probable:If there is
considerable doubt surrounding the credit worthiness of a
customer at the outset of an arrangement, the associated revenue
is deferred and recognized upon cash receipt.   Our multiple element arrangements include our systems and one or
more of the following undelivered software-related elements:
software entitlements and maintenance, premium hardware
maintenance and storage review services. Our software
entitlements and maintenance entitle our customers to receive
unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a
when-and-if-available
basis, bug fixes, and patch releases. Premium hardware
maintenance services include contracts for technical support and
minimum response times. Revenues from software entitlements and
maintenance, premium hardware maintenance services and storage
review services are recognized ratably over the contractual
term, generally from one to three years. We also offer extended
service contracts which extend our standard parts warranty and
may include premium hardware maintenance at the end of the
warranty term; revenues from these contracts are recognized
ratably over the contract term. We typically sell professional
services separately from any of our other revenue elements,
either on a time and materials basis or for fixed price standard
projects; we recognize revenue for these services as they are
performed. Revenue from hardware installation services is
recognized in the period the services are delivered. For
arrangements with multiple elements, we recognize as revenue the
difference between the total arrangement price and the greater
of fair value or stated price for any undelivered elements
the residual method.   For our undelivered software-related elements, we determine fair
value of these undelivered elements based on vendor-specific
objective evidence VSOE of fair value, which for
us consists of the prices charged when these services are sold
separately. To determine the fair value of these elements, we
analyze both the selling prices when elements are sold
separately as well as the concentrations of those prices. We
believe those concentrations have been sufficient to enable us
to establish VSOE of fair value for the undelivered elements. If
VSOE cannot be obtained to establish fair value of the
undelivered elements, it is required that revenue from the
entire arrangement be initially deferred and recognized ratably
over the period these elements are delivered.   For purposes of presentation in the statement of operations,
once fair value has been determined for our undelivered bundled
elements, we allocate revenue first to software entitlements and
maintenance, based on VSOE of its fair value, with the remainder
allocated to other service revenues.   We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at
the time of shipment. Sales returns are estimated based on
historical sales returns, current trends, and our expectations
regarding future experience. We monitor and analyze the accuracy
of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and
adjust them for future expectations to determine the adequacy of
our current and future reserve needs. Our reserve levels have
been sufficient to cover actual returns and have not required
material changes in subsequent periods. While we currently have
no expectations for significant changes to these reserves, if
actual future returns and allowances differ from past
experience, additional allowances may be required.   We also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility
of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts
receivable. We analyze accounts receivable and historical bad
debts, customer concentrations, customer solvency, current
economic and geographic trends, and changes in customer payment
terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of our current
and future allowance. In circumstances where we are aware of a
specific customers inability to meet its financial
obligations to us, a specific allowance for bad debt is
estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable
to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected.
We monitor and analyze the accuracy of our allowance for
doubtful accounts estimate by reviewing past collectibility and
adjusting it for future expectations to determine the adequacy
of our current and future allowance. Our reserve levels have
generally been sufficient to cover credit losses. Our allowance
for doubtful accounts as of April30, 2010 was
$16million, compared to $31million as of
April24, 2009. If the financial condition of our customers
were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability
to make payments, additional allowances may be required.   
38 Table of Contents   Inventory
Valuation and Purchase Order Accruals   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market which
approximates actual cost on a
first-in,
first-out basis. We perform an excess and obsolete analysis of
our inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and
market conditions. We adjust the inventory value based on
estimated excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily
by future demand forecasts. Although we strive for accuracy in
our forecasts of future product demand, any significant
unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments
could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory
commitments and on our reported results. If actual market
conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional
write-downs and other charges against earnings may be required.
If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may realize
higher gross profits in the period when the written-down
inventory is sold. Historically, our inventory reserves have
been sufficient to cover any excess and obsolete exposure and
have not required material adjustments in subsequent periods.   In the normal course of business we make commitments to our
third party contract manufacturers to manage lead times and meet
product forecasts, and to other parties to purchase various key
components used in the manufacture of our products. We establish
accruals for estimated losses on purchased components for which
we believe it is probable that they will not be utilized in
future operations. To the extent that such forecasts are not
achieved, our commitments and associated accruals may change.   We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and
foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage,
discharge, and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in the
manufacture of our products, which may require design changes or
recycling of products we manufacture. We will continue to
monitor our compliance with these regulations, which may require
us to incur higher costs, and adversely impact our operating
results.   Valuation
of Goodwill and Intangibles   Purchased intangible assets are amortized over their useful
lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite.
In-process research and development is capitalized at fair value
and classified as indefinite-lived assets until completion or
abandonment and is subject to periodic review for impairment.
Accordingly, the allocation of acquisition cost to identifiable
intangible assets has a significant impact on our future
operating results. The allocation process requires extensive use
of estimates and assumptions, including estimates of future cash
flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets. Should
conditions be different than managements assessment,
material write-downs of the fair value of intangible assets may
be required. We periodically review the estimated remaining
useful lives of our intangible assets. A reduction in the
estimate of remaining useful life could result in accelerated
amortization expense or a write-down in future periods. As such,
any future write-downs of these assets would adversely affect
our operating results.   We perform an annual review of the valuation of goodwill in the
fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators
of impairment exist. Triggering events for impairment reviews
may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends,
restructuring actions, lower projections of profitability, or a
sustained decline in our market capitalization. Evaluations of
possible impairment and, if applicable, adjustments to carrying
values require us to estimate, among other factors, future cash
flows, useful lives, and fair market values of our reporting
units and assets. When we conduct our evaluation of goodwill,
the fair value of goodwill is assessed using valuation
techniques that require significant management judgment. Should
conditions be different from managements last assessment,
significant write-downs of goodwill may be required, which would
adversely affect our operating results. In fiscal 2010 we
performed such evaluation and found no impairment of goodwill.   Restructuring
Reserves   We recognize a liability for restructuring costs when the
liability is incurred. The restructuring accruals are based upon
management estimates at the time they are recorded. These
estimates can change depending upon changes in facts and
circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability was
recorded. The main components of our restructuring charges are
workforce reduction, intangibles and fixed assets write-offs and
non-cancelable lease costs related to excess facilities.
Severance-related charges are accrued when it is determined that
a liability has been incurred, which is generally when
individuals have been notified of their termination dates and
expected severance payments. We record contract cancellation
costs when contracts are terminated. The decision to eliminate   
39 Table of Contents   excess facilities results in charges for lease termination fees
and future commitments to pay lease charges, net of estimated
future sublease income. We recognize charges for elimination of
excess facilities when we have vacated the premises. Intangible
asset write-offs consist of impairment of acquired intangible
assets related to our decision to cease the development and
availability of specific products. Fixed assets write-offs
primarily consist of equipment, software and furniture
associated with excess facilities being eliminated, and are
based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash
flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate
sale or disposal of the equipment and furniture.   Our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some
of which are beyond our control, including future real estate
market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into
subleases or lease termination agreements with terms as
favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates. We
regularly evaluate a number of factors to determine the
appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring
accruals, including the various assumptions noted above. If
actual results differ significantly from our estimates, we may
be required to adjust our restructuring accruals in the future.   Product
Warranties   Estimated future warranty costs are expensed as a cost of
product revenues when revenue is recognized, based on estimates
of the costs that may be incurred under our warranty obligations
including material, distribution and labor costs. Our accrued
liability for estimated future warranty costs is included in
other accrued liabilities and other long-term obligations on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Factors that affect
our warranty liability include the number of installed units,
estimated material costs, estimated distribution costs and
estimated labor costs. We periodically assess the adequacy of
our warranty accrual and adjust the amount as considered
necessary.   Stock-Based
Compensation   We account for stock-based compensation using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option
grant on the date of grant. Our option pricing model requires
the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the
expected stock price volatility, expected term, and forfeiture
rate. Any changes in these highly subjective assumptions
significantly impact stock-based compensation expense.   Loss
Contingencies   We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies
arising in the course of business. We consider the likelihood of
the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a
liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the
amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated
loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability
has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount
of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate
current information available to us to determine whether such
accruals should be adjusted.   Fair
Value Measurements and Impairments   All of our
available-for-sale
investments and nonmarketable securities are subject to periodic
impairment review. Investments are considered to be impaired
when a decline in fair value is judged to be
other-than-temporary.
This determination requires significant judgment. For publicly
traded investments, impairment is determined based upon the
specific facts and circumstances present at the time, including
factors such as current economic and market conditions, the
credit rating of the securitys issuer, the length of time
an investments fair value has been below our carrying
value, and our ability and intent to hold investments to
maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any
anticipated recovery in fair value. If an investments
decline in fair value, caused by factors other than changes in
interest rates, is deemed to be
other-than-temporary,
we reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value, as
determined based on quoted market prices, liquidation values or
other metrics. For investments in publicly held companies, we
recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair
value of our investment is below its cost basis and is judged to
be
other-than-temporary.
The ultimate value realized on these investments is subject to
market price volatility until they are sold.   
40 Table of Contents   Pursuant to the accounting guidance for fair value measurement
and its subsequent updates, fair value is defined as the price
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability i.e., the exit price in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used
in measuring fair value that minimizes the use of unobservable
inputs by requiring the use of observable market data when
available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability based on active
market data. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the
assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset
or liability based on the best information available in the
circumstances.   The fair value hierarchy is broken down into the three input
levels summarized below   
Level1 Valuations are based on quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, and
readily accessible by us at the reporting date. Examples of
assets and liabilities utilizing Level1 inputs are certain
money market funds, U.S.Treasuries and trading securities
with quoted prices on active markets.   
Level2 Valuations based on inputs other than
the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either
directly or indirectly in active markets. Examples of assets and
liabilities utilizing Level2 inputs are
U.S.government agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial
paper, certificates of deposit and
over-the-counter
derivatives.   
Level3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs
in which there is little or no market data, which require us to
develop our own assumptions. Examples of assets and liabilities
utilizing Level3 inputs are cost method investments,
auction rate securities ARS and the Primary Fund.   We measure our
available-for-sale
securities at fair value on a recurring basis.
Available-for-sale
securities include U.S.Treasury securities,
U.S.government agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial
paper, ARSs, money market funds and certificates of deposit.
Where possible, we utilize quoted market prices to measure and
such items are classified as Level1 in the hierarchy. When
quoted market prices for identical assets are unavailable,
varying valuation techniques are used. Such assets are
classified as Level2 or Level3 in the hierarchy. We
classify items in Level2 if investments are valued using
observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields,
reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing
sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. We
classify items in Level3 if investments are valued using a
pricing model, based on unobservable inputs in the market or
that require us to develop our own assumptions. Our assessment
of the significance of a particular input to the fair value
measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers
factors specific to the investment.   We are also exposed to market risk relating to our
available-for-sale
investments due to uncertainties in the credit and capital
markets. The fair value of our investments may change
significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and
capital markets. These securities/issuers could be subject to
review for possible downgrade. Any downgrade in these credit
ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated
fair value of our investments. We monitor and evaluate the
accounting for our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for
additional
other-than-temporary
impairment charges.   We actively review current investment ratings, company specific
events, and general economic conditions in managing our
investments and determining whether there is a significant
decline in fair value that is
other-than-temporary.
As of April30, 2010 and April24, 2009, our
short-term and long-term investments in marketable securities
have been classified as
available-for-sale
and are carried at fair value.
Available-for-sale
investments with original maturities of greater than three
months at the date of purchases are classified as short-term
investments as these investments generally consist of marketable
securities that are intended to be available to meet current
cash requirements. Currently, all marketable securities held by
us are classified as
available-for-sale
and our entire ARS portfolio is classified as long-term
investments.   Our ARS portfolio consists of securities with long-term nominal
maturities which, in accordance with investment policy
guidelines, had credit ratings of AAA and Aaa at the time of
purchase. During fiscal 2008, we reclassified all of our
investments in ARS from short-term investments to long-term
investments as we believed our ability to liquidate these
investments in the next twelve months was uncertain. Based on an
analysis of the fair value and marketability of these
investments, we recorded temporary impairment charges of
approximately $33million during fiscal 2010, partially
offset by $07million in unrealized gains within other
comprehensive income loss.   
41 Table of Contents   During fiscal 2009, we recorded temporary impairment charges of
approximately $70million, partially offset by
$03million in unrealized gains within other comprehensive
income loss. In addition, during fiscal 2009, we recorded an
other-than-temporary
impairment loss of $21million due to a significant
decline in the estimated fair values of certain of our ARS
related to credit quality risk and rating downgrades.   The valuation models used to estimate the fair value of our ARS
included numerous assumptions such as assessments of the
underlying structure of each security, expected cash flows,
discount rates, credit ratings, workout periods, and overall
capital market liquidity. These assumptions, assessments and the
interpretations of relevant market data are subject to
uncertainties, are difficult to predict and require significant
judgment. The use of different assumptions, or applying
different judgments to inherently subjective matters and changes
in future market conditions could result in significantly
different estimates of fair value. There is no assurance as to
when the market for auction rate securities will stabilize. The
fair value of our ARS could change significantly based on market
conditions and continued uncertainties in the credit markets. If
these uncertainties continue or if these securities experience
credit rating downgrades, we may incur additional temporary
impairment related to our auction rate securities portfolio. We
will continue to monitor the fair value of our ARS and relevant
market conditions and will record additional temporary or
other-than-temporary
impairments if future circumstances warrant such charges.   As a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers, which
occurred during fiscal 2009, we recorded an
other-than-temporary
impairment charge of $118million on our corporate bonds
related to investments in LehmanBrothers securities and
approximately $93million on our investments in the
Primary Fund that held Lehman Brothers investments. During
fiscal 2010, we sold our remaining holdings of Lehman Brothers
bonds and the Primary Fund made multiple distributions of its
assets to its investors, and as of April30, 2010, we
recovered our recorded investment, with the exception of
$02million, for which we recognized an additional loss.
As of April30, 2010, we no longer had any direct or
indirect investments related to Lehman Brothers and have
recognized all related losses in our statement of operations.   During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, recognized gains and losses
on
available-for-sale
investments were not material. Management determines the
appropriate classification of investments at the time of
purchase and reevaluates the classification at each reporting
date. The fair value of our marketable securities, including
those included in cash equivalents and long-term investments,
was $3,6052million and $2,5966million as of
April30, 2010 and April24, 2009, respectively.   To determine the fair value of nonmarketable investments, we use
the most recent information available to us, including new
financings or estimates of current fair value, as well as
through traditional valuation techniques. It is our policy to
review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to
determine whether the investments in these companies are
other-than-temporarily
impaired. In the case of privately-held companies, this
evaluation is based on information that we request from these
companies. If we believe the carrying value of an investment is
in excess of fair value, and this difference is
other-than-temporary,
it is our policy to write down the investment to fair value. The
carrying value of our investments in privately-held companies
was $14million and $39million as of April30,
2010 and April24, 2009, respectively. During fiscal 2010
and 2009, we recorded $34million of gains and
$63million of net impairment charges in our consolidated
statements of operations, respectively, for our investments in
privately-held companies, and adjusted the carrying amount of
those investments to fair value, as we deemed the decline in the
value of these assets to be
other-than-temporary.   Income
Taxes   The determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments
and estimates due to the complexity of the tax law that we are
subject to in several tax jurisdictions. Earnings derived from
our international business are generally taxed at rates that are
lower than U.S.rates, resulting in a lower effective tax
rate than the U.S.statutory tax rate of 350%. The ability
to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent on
existing tax laws in both the UnitedStates and the
respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are
located. Future changes in domestic or international tax laws
could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we
are currently receiving. In addition, a decrease in the
percentage of our total earnings from international business or
a change in the mix of international business among particular
tax jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate.   
42 Table of Contents   We account for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the effect of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
We reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is
more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset
will not be realized. Tax attributes related to the exercise of
employee stock options are not realized until they result in a
reduction of taxes payable. We do not include unrealized stock
option attributes as components of our gross deferred tax assets
and corresponding valuation allowance disclosures.   We have provided a valuation allowance of $283million as
of April30, 2010, compared to $280million as of
April24, 2009 and $286million as of April25,
2008, on certain of our deferred tax assets. The changes in
valuation allowance in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were primarily
related to changes in the blended state tax rates. The tax
effected amounts of gross unrealized net operating loss and
business tax credit carryforwards, net of their corresponding
valuation allowance at April30, 2010 are
$3586million.   We recognize tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions by
applying a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We
recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions
on income tax returns based on a two-step process. The first
step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that
each income tax position would be sustained upon audit. The
second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the
amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority. Estimating
these amounts requires us to determine the probability of
various possible outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax
positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on the
consideration of several factors, including changes in facts or
circumstances, changes in applicable tax law, settlement of
issues under audit and new exposures. If we later determine that
our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to
cover our revised expectations, we adjust the liability and
effect a related change in our tax provision during the period
in which we make such determination.   New

statements for a full description of new accounting
pronouncements, including the respective expected dates of
adoption and effects on results of operations and financial
condition.

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, and decreased by
$898million, or 4% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal
2008. Our configured systems comprise bundled hardware and
software products. Configured systems unit volume increased by
19% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, with the largest
increase in low-end systems, and increased by 14% in fiscal 2009
compared to fiscal 2008, reflecting an increase in low-end
systems, partially offset by decreases in mid-range and high-end
systems.   During fiscal 2010, high-end, midrange and low-end systems
generated approximately 23%, 56% and 21% of configured systems
revenues, respectively, compared to approximately 24%, 55% and
21%, respectively in fiscal 2009, and approximately 25%, 59% and
16%, respectively, in fiscal 2008. Overall average selling
prices ASPs declined in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009
due primarily to a shift in mix towards low-end systems, as well
as lower ASPs per unit in midrange and low-end systems. ASPs
declined in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, due primarily
to lower ASPs in all systems ranges and a shift in mix towards
low-end systems.   In addition, our net add-on hardware, software and other product
revenues accounted for an $885million increase in fiscal
2010 compared to fiscal 2009 and a $1024million increase
in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to customers
increasing the capacity of their storage systems.   Our systems are highly configurable to respond to customer
requirements in the open systems storage markets that we serve.
This wide variation in customer configurations can significantly
impact revenues, cost of revenues, and gross profit performance.
Price changes, unit volumes, customer mix and product
configuration can also impact revenues, cost of revenues and
gross profit performance. Disks are a significant component of
our storage systems. Industry disk pricing continues to fall
every year, and we pass along those price decreases to our
customers while working to maintain relatively constant profit
margins on our disk drives. While our sales price per terabyte
continues to decline, improved system performance, increased
capacity and software to manage this increased capacity have an
offsetting impact on product revenues.   Software

Sales to the United States accounted for 89%, 90% and 91% of
Americas revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.   Revenues from the Americas geographic area increased by
$4029million in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, due
to an increase in gross revenues of $5316million and the
negative impact in fiscal 2009 of the $1287million GSA
settlement. Sales to Germany accounted for 11% of net revenues
in each of fiscal 2010 and 2009, and less than 10% of net
revenues in fiscal 2008. No other single foreign country
accounted for ten percent or more of net revenues in any of the
years presented.   Cost
of Revenues   Our cost of revenues consists of three elements: 1cost
of product revenues, which includes the costs of manufacturing
and shipping of our storage systems, amortization of purchased
intangible assets, inventory write-downs, and warranty costs;
2cost of software maintenance and entitlements, which
includes the costs of providing software entitlements and
maintenance and third party royalty costs, and 3cost of
service, which reflects costs

hardware, global support partnership programs, professional
services and educational and training services.   Our gross profits are impacted by a variety of factors including
pricing and discount practices, channel sales mix, revenue mix
and product material costs. Service gross profit is also
typically impacted by factors such as changes in the size of our
installed base of products, as well as the timing of support
service initiations and renewals, and incremental investments in
our customer support infrastructure. If our shipment volumes,
product and services mix, average selling prices and pricing
actions that impact our gross profit are adversely affected,
whether by economic uncertainties or for other reasons, our
gross profit could decline.   Cost

materials costs, warranty costs and demonstration equipment
reserves, partially offset by higher unit volume. Cost of
product revenues increased by $692million, or 7%, in
fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to increased
materials cost as a result of increased unit volume and higher
per unit costs in all products ranges.   The decrease in cost of product revenues in fiscal 2010 compared
to fiscal 2009 reflected a decrease in materials costs of
$99million despite an increase in total units shipped.
Our material costs were favorably impacted in fiscal 2010 by
lower average per unit materials costs in our midrange and
low-end systems due to favorable materials pricing, which we
expect to continue. These favorable impacts were offset by
higher unit volume and higher average per unit materials costs
in our high-end systems. In addition, our cost of product
revenues were favorably impacted in fiscal 2010 compared to
fiscal 2009 as a result of a decrease of $113million in
warranty costs and $86million in reserves for evaluation
equipment due to higher than anticipated sales of such equipment
to customers. Cost of product revenues were negatively impacted
in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of
approximately $97million of incremental inventory
writedowns.   Cost of product revenues represented 41% of product revenue for
2010 compared to 47% for 2009, and 42% in fiscal 2008. The
overall reduction of costs as a percentage of revenues in fiscal
2010 was the result of per unit materials cost reductions
outpacing sales price reductions. The increase in materials
costs as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2009 reflected
higher per unit materials costs compared to the prior year.   Cost of product revenues increased decreased due to the

2008. The decrease in service cost of revenues as a percentage
of service revenue was primarily due to improved productivity.   Operating
Expenses   Sales and
Marketing, Research and Development, and General and
Administrative Expenses   Compensation costs comprise the largest component of operating
expenses. Included in compensation costs are salaries and
related benefits, stock-based compensation costs and employee
incentive compensation plan costs. Compensation costs included
in operating expenses increased approximately
$1086million, or 11%, during fiscal 2010 compared to
fiscal 2009, primarily due to ia $756million
increase in employee incentive compensation due to stronger
operating profit performance, iia $164million

performance compared to fiscal 2009.   Compensation costs included in operating expenses increased
approximately $1114million, or 12%, during fiscal 2009

2009, we announced our decision to execute a worldwide
restructuring program, which included a reduction in workforce,
the closing or downsizing of certain facilities, and the
establishment of a plan to outsource certain internal
activities. In December 2008, we announced our decision to cease
the development and availability of SnapMirror for Open Systems
SMOS, which was originally acquired through our acquisition of
Topio in fiscal 2007. As part of this decision, we also
announced the closure of our engineering facility in Haifa,
Israel. These restructuring activities resulted in restructuring
charges in fiscal 2009 totaling $515million of
severance-related amounts and other charges attributable to the
termination of approximately 450 regular positions, abandoned
excess facilities, charges relating to non-cancelable lease
costs, which are net of expected sublease income; contract
cancellation charges; outplacement expenses; fixed assets and
intangibles write-offs; as well as $29million of other
charges to support our restructuring initiatives. In fiscal
2010, we recorded additional charges of $25million
primarily related to adjustments to future lease commitments and
employee severance costs associated with our fiscal 2009
restructuring plan.   In recording the facility lease restructuring reserve, we made
certain estimates and assumptions related to the itime
period over which the relevant buildings would remain vacant,
iisublease terms, and iiisublease rates.   Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Plan As of
April30, 2010, we had $05million remaining in
facility restructuring reserves established as part of a
restructuring in fiscal 2002 related to future lease commitments
on exited facilities, net of expected sublease income. We
reevaluate our estimates and assumptions periodically and make
adjustments as necessary based on the time period over which the
facilities will be vacant, expected sublease terms, and expected
sublease rates.   As of April30, 2010, the remaining balance of the
restructuring reserve related to the fiscal 2009 and 2002
restructuring plans consisted of approximately $41million
of facilities-related lease payments, which we expect to be
substantially paid by January 2013.   See Note13 of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements for further discussion of our restructuring
activities.   Acquisition

Directors terminated the merger agreement and pursuant to the
terms of the agreement, Data Domain paid us a $570million
termination fee. We incurred $159million of incremental
third-party costs relating to the terminated merger transaction
during the same period, resulting in net proceeds of
$411million recorded in the consolidated statement of

and Capital Resources   The following sections discuss our principal liquidity
requirements, as well as our sources and uses of cash flows on
our liquidity and capital resources. The principal objectives of
our investment policy are the preservation of principal and
maintenance of liquidity. We attempt to mitigate default risk by
investing in high-quality investment grade securities, limiting
the time to maturity and by monitoring the counter-parties and
underlying obligors closely. We believe our cash equivalents and
short-term investments are liquid and accessible. We are not
aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our
cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of
April30, 2010.   
52 Table of Contents   Liquidity
Sources, Cash Requirements   Our principal sources of liquidity as of April30, 2010
consisted of approximately $37billion in cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments and cash we expect to
generate from operations.   Cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following   	
April30, 2010   April24, 2009   Cash and cash equivalents     1,7050     1,4942   Short-term investments   2,0190   1,1101   Long-term investments and restricted cash   728   1273   Total cash, cash equivalents and investments     3,7968     2,7316   Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our
working capital needs, support ongoing business activities,
research and development, capital expenditure needs, investment
in critical or complementary technologies, and to service our
debt and synthetic leases.   Key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in
our revenue mix and profitability, as well as our ability to
effectively manage our working capital, in particular, accounts
receivable and inventories. Based on our current business
outlook, we believe that our sources of cash will satisfy our
working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment
requirements, stock repurchases, contractual obligations,
commitments, interest payments on our Notes and other liquidity
requirements associated with operations and meet our cash
requirements for at least the next 12months. However, in
the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to
further curtail spending and implement additional cost saving
measures and restructuring actions. In light of the current
economic and market conditions, we cannot be certain that we
will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels
or that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if
necessary, on satisfactory terms, if at all.   Our contractual obligations as of April30, 2010 are
summarized below in the Contractual Obligations tables.   Our investment portfolio, including auction rate securities has
been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to
trends in the credit and capital markets. However, we are not
dependent on liquidating these investments in the next twelve
months in order to meet our liquidity needs. We continue to
closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize
our market risk on our investment portfolio. Based on our
ability to access our cash and short-term investments, our
expected operating cash flows, and our other potential sources
of cash, we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity of
these investments will impact our ability to fund working
capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other cash
requirements. We intend to and believe that we have the ability
to hold these investments until the market recovers. If current
market conditions deteriorate, we may be required to record
additional charges to earnings in future periods.   Capital
Expenditure Requirements   We expect to fund our capital expenditures, including our
commitments related to facilities and equipment operating
leases, over the next few years through existing cash, cash
equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations. The
timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be
precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of
factors including future demand for products, product mix,
changes in the network storage industry, hiring plans and our
decisions related to financing our facilities requirement. We
expect that our existing facilities and those being developed in
Sunnyvale, California; RTP, North Carolina; and worldwide are
adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years
and that additional space will be available as needed.   Acquisition
Related Requirements   On April6, 2010, we entered into a definitive agreement to
acquire Bycast Inc. for approximately $80million in cash.
The merger was completed on May13, 2010.   
53 Table of Contents   Cash
Flows   As of April30, 2010, compared to April24, 2009, our
cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments increased
by $11billion to $37billion. The increase in cash
and cash equivalents and short-term investments was primarily a
result of cash provided by operating activities and issuances of
common stock related to employee stock option exercises and
employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by capital
expenditures. We derive our liquidity and capital resources
primarily from our cash flow from operations and from working
capital. Days sales outstanding as of April30, 2010
decreased to 37days, compared to 46days as of
April24, 2009, primarily due to improvements in shipment
linearity and collections performance. Working capital increased
by $09billion to $26billion as of April30,
2010, compared to $18billion as of April24, 2009,
primarily due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments of $11billion.   Cash
Flows from Operating Activities   During fiscal 2010 and 2009, we generated cash flows from
operating activities of $9750million and
$8892million, respectively. The primary sources of cash
from operations in fiscal 2010 consisted of net income of
$4004million, adjusted by non-cash stock-based
compensation expense of $1598million and depreciation and
amortization expense of $1660million. Significant changes
in assets and liabilities impacting operating cash flows in
fiscal 2010 included an increase in deferred revenue of
$1767million, and an increase in accrued compensation and
other current liabilities of $532million. The primary
sources of cash from operations in fiscal 2009 consisted of net
income of $646million, adjusted by non-cash stock-based
compensation expense of $1408million, depreciation and
amortization expense of $1705million and a deferred tax
provision of $1246million. Significant changes in assets
and liabilities impacting operating cash flows in fiscal 2009
included a decrease in accounts receivable of
$1287million, an increase in deferred revenue of
$2193million, and an increase in other current
liabilities of $1287million related to the GSA settlement.   We expect that cash provided by operating activities may
fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors,
including fluctuations in our operating results, shipment
linearity, accounts receivable collections performance,
inventory and supply chain management, tax benefits from
stock-based compensation, and the timing and amount of
compensation and other payments.   Cash
Flows from Investing Activities   Capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 were $1356million,
which included the purchase of fifteen acres of land in
Bangalore, India for approximately $285million, compared
to $2896million in fiscal 2009. We paid
$8603million for net purchases and redemptions of
short-term investments in fiscal 2010, compared to
$1168million in fiscal 2009. In addition, in fiscal 2009
we reclassified $5980million of cash equivalents related
to the Primary Fund to short-term investments.   Cash
Flows from Financing Activities   We received $2199million and $6966million from
financing activities in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Proceeds from employee equity award plans, net of shares
withheld for taxes were $1971million in fiscal 2010,
compared to $859million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010,
we received $142million from the settlement of a Note
hedge with Lehman Brothers. In fiscal 2009, we issued
$1265billion of convertible notes, received proceeds of
$1631million for sale of related common stock warrants,
and paid $2549million for purchase of related note
hedges, made repayments of $1726million against our
Secured Credit Agreement and the Term Loan and repurchased
170million shares of common stock for a total of
$4000million.   Net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to
employee participation in employee equity award programs have
historically been a significant component of our liquidity. The
extent to which our employees exercise stock options or
participate in our ESPP program generally increases or decreases
based upon changes in the market price of our common stock. As a
result, our cash flow resulting from the issuance of common
stock in connection with these programs and related tax benefits
will vary.   
54 Table of Contents   Stock
Repurchase Program   At April30, 2010, $11billion remained available for
future repurchases under plans approved as of that date. The
stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any
time.   Convertible
Notes   As of April30, 2010, we had $1265billion principal
amount of 175%Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 See
Note10 of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. The Notes will mature on June1, 2013, unless
earlier repurchased or converted. As of April30, 2010, the
Notes have not been repurchased or converted. We also have not
received any shares under the related Note hedges or delivered
cash or shares under the related warrants.   Credit
Facility   Effective December22, 2009, we terminated our senior
unsecured credit agreement as further discussed in Note10
of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.   Contractual
Obligations   The following summarizes our contractual obligations at
April30, 2010 and the effect such obligations are expected
to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in

managements estimates and assumptions about these
obligations, including their duration, the possibility of
renewal or termination, anticipated actions by management and
third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and
assumptions are necessarily subjective, our actual future
obligations may vary from those reflected in the table.   
1 
Included in real estate lease payments pursuant to four
financing arrangements with BNP Paribas LLC BNPPLC are
ilease commitments of $36million in each of the
fiscal years 2011 and 2012; and $24million in fiscal
2013, which are based on either the LIBOR rate at April30,
2010 plus a spread or a fixed rate for terms of five years, and
iiat the expiration or termination of the lease, a
supplemental payment obligation equal to our minimum guarantee
of $1271million in the event that we elect not to
purchase or arrange for sale of the buildings.   
2 
Contract manufacturer commitments consist of obligations for on
hand inventories and non-cancelable purchase order with our
contract manufacturer. We record a liability for firm,
noncancelable, and nonreturnable   
55 Table of Contents   
purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future
demand forecasts, which is consistent with the valuation of our
excess and obsolete inventory. As of April30, 2010, the
liability for these purchase commitments in excess of future
demand was approximately $38million and is recorded in
other current liabilities.   
3 
Purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase
orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of
business, other than commitments with contract manufacturers and
suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services.
Purchase obligations do not include contracts that may be
cancelled without penalty. Although open purchase orders are
considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally
allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our
requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery
of goods or performance of services.   
4 
Included in these amounts are obligations related to the
$1265billion principal amount of 175%Notes due
2013 see Note10 of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. Estimated interest payments for the Notes
are $774million for fiscal 2011 through fiscal 2014.   
5 
As of April30, 2010, our liability for uncertain tax
positions was $1224million, which due to the uncertainty
of the timing of future payments, are presented in the total
column on a separate line in this table.   As of April30, 2010, we have four leasing arrangements
Leasing Arrangements 1, 2, 3 and 4with BNPPLC which
requires us to lease certain of our land to BNPPLC for a period
of 99years and to lease approximately 06million
square feet of office space for our headquarters in Sunnyvale,
which had an original cost of $1496million. Under these
leasing arrangements, we pay BNPPLC minimum lease payments,
which vary based on LIBOR plus a spread or a fixed rate on the
costs of the facilities on the respective lease commencement
dates. We make payments for each of the leases for a term of
five years. We have the option to renew each of the leases for
two consecutive five-year periods upon approval by BNPPLC. Upon
expiration or upon any earlier termination of the lease terms,
we must elect one of the following options: ipurchase
the buildings from BNPPLC at cost; iiif certain
conditions are met, arrange for the sale of the buildings by
BNPPLC to a third party for an amount equal to at least 85% of
the costs residual guarantee, and be liable for any deficiency
between the net proceeds received from the third party and such
amounts; or iiipay BNPPLC supplemental payments for an
amount equal to at least 85% of the costs residual guarantee,
in which event we may recoup some or all of such payments by
arranging for a sale of each or all buildings by BNPPLC during
the ensuing two-year period. The following table summarizes the
costs, the residual guarantee, the applicable LIBOR plus spread
or fixed rate at April30, 2010 and the date we began to
make payments for each of our leasing arrangements in millions

with which we were in compliance as of April30, 2010. Such
financial covenants include a maximum ratio of Total Debt to
Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization
and a minimum amount of Unencumbered Cash and Short-Term
Investments. Our failure to comply with these financial
covenants could result in a default under the leases which,
subject to our right and ability to exercise our purchase
option, would give BNPPLC the right to, among other things,
iterminate our possession of the leased property and
require us to pay lease termination damages and other amounts as
set forth in the lease agreements, or iiexercise certain
foreclosure remedies. If we were to exercise our purchase
option, or be required to pay lease termination damages, these
payments would significantly reduce our available liquidity,
which could constrain our operating flexibility.   As of April30, 2010, we estimated that the fair value of
the properties under synthetic lease was $369million less
than their aggregate residual guarantees. We are accruing for
this deficiency over the remaining terms of the respective
leases.   
56 Table of Contents   We may from time to time terminate one or more of our leasing
arrangements and repay amounts outstanding in order to meet our
operating or other objectives.   Legal
Contingencies   On September5, 2007, we filed a patent infringement
lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory
damages and a permanent injunction against Sun Microsystems. On
October25, 2007, SunMicrosystems filed a counter
claim against us in the Eastern District of Texas seeking
compensatory damages and a permanent injunction. On
October29, 2007, Sun filed a second lawsuit against us in
the Northern District of California asserting additional patents
against us. The Texas court granted a joint motion to transfer
the Texas lawsuit to the Northern District of California on
November26, 2007. On March26, 2008, Sun filed a
third lawsuit in federal court that extends the patent
infringement charges to storage management technology we
acquired in January 2008. In January 2010, Oracle acquired Sun.
The three lawsuits are currently in the discovery and motion
phase and no trial dates have been set, so we are unable at this
time to determine the likely outcome of these various patent
litigations. In addition, as we are unable to reasonably
estimate the amount or range of the potential settlement, no
accrual has been recorded as of April30, 2010.   In addition, we are subject to various legal proceedings and
claims which have arisen or may arise in the normal course of
business. While the outcome of these legal matters is currently
not determinable, we do not believe that any current litigation
or claims will have a material adverse effect on our business,
cash flow, operating results, or financial condition.   Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   During the ordinary course of business, we provide standby
letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third
parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by
us or our subsidiaries. As of April30, 2010, our financial
guarantees of $51million that were not recorded on our
balance sheet consisted of standby letters of credit related to
workers compensation, a customs guarantee, a corporate
credit card program, foreign rent guarantees and surety bonds,
which were primarily related to self-insurance.   We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign
currency risk. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is
to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated
with changes in foreign currency. The program is not designated
for trading or speculative purposes. Currently, we do not enter
into any foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures
related to firm commitments or nonmarketable investments. Our
major foreign currency exchange exposures and related hedging
programs are described below   
We utilize monthly foreign currency forward and options
contracts to hedge exchange rate fluctuations related to certain
foreign monetary assets and liabilities.   
We use currency forward contracts to hedge exposures related to
forecasted sales denominated in certain foreign currencies.
These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and in
general closely match the underlying forecasted transactions in
duration.   As of April30, 2010, our notional fair value of foreign
exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled
$4842million. We do not believe that these derivatives
present significant credit risks, because of the short term
maturity of the outstanding contracts at any point in time, the
counterparties to the derivatives consist of major financial
institutions, and we manage the notional amount of contracts
entered into with any one counterparty. Other than the risk
associated with the financial condition of the counterparties,
our maximum exposure related to foreign currency forward and
option contracts is limited to the premiums paid. See
Note12 of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements for more information related to our hedging
activities.   In the ordinary course of business, we enter into recourse lease
financing arrangements with third-party leasing companies and
from time to time provide guarantees for a portion of other
financing arrangements under which we could be called upon to
make payments to the third-party funding companies in the event
of nonpayment by end-user customers. See Note18 of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for more
information related to these financing arrangements.   
57 Table of Contents   We enter into indemnification agreements with third parties in
the ordinary course of business. Generally, these
indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses
suffered by the third party due to various events, such as
lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement. These
indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet
arrangements under accounting guidance.   We have commitments related to four lease arrangements with
BNPPLC for approximately 06million square feet of office
space for our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California as further
described above under Contractual Obligations.   We have evaluated our accounting for these leases as required by
guidance on accounting for variable interest entities and have
determined the following   
BNPPLC is a leasing company for BNP Paribas in the United
States. BNPPLC is not a special purpose entity
organized for the sole purpose of facilitating the leases to us.
The obligation to absorb expected losses and receive expected
residual returns rests with the parent, BNP Paribas. Therefore,
we are not the primary beneficiary of BNPPLC as we do not absorb
the majority of BNPPLCs expected losses or expected
residual returns;and   
BNPPLC has represented in the related closing agreements that
the fair value of the property leased to us by BNPPLC is less
than half of the total of the fair values of all assets of
BNPPLC, excluding any assets of BNPPLC held within a silo.
Further, the property leased to NetApp is not held within a
silo. The definition of held within a silo means
that BNPPLC has obtained funds equal to or in excess of 95% of
the fair value of the leased asset to acquire or maintain its
investment in such asset through nonrecourse financing or other
contractual arrangements, the effect of which is to leave such
asset or proceeds thereof as the only significant asset of
BNPPLC at risk for the repayment of such funds.   Accordingly, under current accounting guidance, we are not
required to consolidate either the leasing entity or the
specific assets that we lease under the BNPPLC lease. Our future
minimum lease payments and residual guarantees under these real
estate leases will amount to a total of $1367million as
discussed in above in Contractual Obligations.   
Item7A.
Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in
interest rates, market prices, and foreign currency exchange
rates. We use certain derivative financial instruments to manage
these risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for
speculative or trading purposes. All financial instruments are
used in accordance with management-approved policies.   Market
Risk and Market Interest Risk   Investment and Interest Income As of
April30, 2010, we had
available-for-sale
investments of $21billion. Our investment portfolio
primarily consists of investments with original maturities at
the date of purchase of greater than three months, which are
classified as
available-for-sale.
These investments, consisting primarily of corporate bonds,
commercial paper, U.S.government agency bonds,
U.S.Treasuries, and certificates of deposit, are subject
to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in
value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical
10percent increase in market interest rates from levels at
April30, 2010 would cause the fair value of these
available-for-sale
investments to decline by approximately $36million.
Volatility in market interest rates over time will cause
variability in our interest income. We do not use derivative
financial instruments in our investment portfolio.   Our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through
diversification and investment in highly rated securities. We
further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our
investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities
of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies
and type of issuer. We actively review, along with our
investment advisors, current investment ratings, company
specific events and general economic conditions in managing our
investments and in determining whether there is a significant
decline in fair value that is
other-than-temporary.
We will monitor and evaluate the accounting for our investment
portfolio on a quarterly basis for additional
other-than-temporary
impairment charges.   
58 Table of Contents   We are also exposed to market risk relating to our auction rate
securities due to uncertainties in the credit and capital
markets. As of April30, 2010, we recorded cumulative
unrealized loss of $33million, offset by
$07million of unrealized gains related to these
securities. The fair value of our auction rate securities may
change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit
and capital markets. These securities/issuers could be subject
to review for possible downgrade. Any downgrade in these credit
ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated
fair value of our auction rate securities. Changes in the
various assumptions used to value these securities and any
increase in the markets perceived risk associated with
such investments may also result in a decline in estimated fair
value.   If current market conditions deteriorate, or the anticipated
recovery in market values does not occur, we may be required to
record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive
income loss or
other-than-temporary
impairment charges to earnings in future quarters. We intend,
and have the ability, to hold these investments until the market
recovers. We do not believe that the lack of liquidity relating
to our portfolio investments will impact our ability to fund
working capital needs, capital expenditures or other operating
requirements. See Note9 of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements in PartII, Item8;
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital
Resources, in PartII, Item7; and Risk Factors
in PartI, Item1A of this Annual Report on
Form10-K
for a description of recent market events that may affect the
value and liquidity of the investments in our portfolio that we
held at April30, 2010.   Lease Commitments As of April30, 2010,
one of our four lease arrangements with BNPPLC is based on a
floating interest rate. The minimum lease payments will vary
based on LIBOR plus a spread. All of our leases have an initial
term of five years, and we have the option to renew these leases
for two consecutive five-year periods upon approval by BNPPLC. A
hypothetical 10percent increase in market interest rate
from the level at April30, 2010 would increase our lease
payments on this one floating lease arrangement under the
initial five-year term by an immaterial amount. We do not
currently hedge against market interest rate increases.   Convertible Notes In June 2008, we issued
$1265billion principal amount of 175%Notes due
2013, of which $1017billion was allocated to debt and
$0248billion was allocated to equity. Holders may convert
the Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain
circumstances, including, but not limited to   
during the five business day period after any five consecutive
trading day period in which the trading price of the Notes for
each day in this five consecutive trading day period was less
than 98% of an amount equal to ithe last reported sale
price of our common stock multiplied by iithe conversion
rate on such day   
during any calendar quarter if the last reported sale price of
our common stock for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30
consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the
immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the
applicable conversion price in effect for the Notes on the last
trading day of such immediately preceding calendar
quarter;or   
upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions under
the indenture for the Notes.   The Notes are convertible into the right to receive cash in an
amount up to the principal amount and shares of our common stock
for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, if
any, at an initial conversion rate of 314006shares of
common stock per one thousand principal amount of Notes, subject
to adjustment as described in the indenture governing the Notes,
which represents an initial conversion price of $3185 per share.   Upon conversion, a holder will receive cash in an amount equal
to the lesser of the conversion value and the principal amount
of the Notes, and any shares of our common stock for any
conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the Notes.
Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into
convertible note hedge transactions and separately, warrant
transactions, to reduce the potential dilution from the
conversion of the Notes and to mitigate any negative effect such
conversion may have on the price of our common stock. In fiscal
2010, we terminated the hedge transaction with a counterparty to
20% of our Note hedges, and because we have decided not to
replace the hedge, we are subject to potential dilution on the
20% unhedged portion of our Notes upon conversion if on the date
of conversion the per-share market price of our common stock
exceeds the conversion price of $3185.   
59 Table of Contents   As of April30, 2010, none of the conditions allowing the
holders of the Notes to convert had been met and we had not
issued any shares related to the Notes. Based on the closing
price of our common stock of $3467 on April30, 2010, the
if-converted value of our Notes exceeded their principal amount
by approximately $112million.   The fair value of our Notes is subject to interest rate risk,
market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature.
Generally, the fair value of Notes will increase as interest
rates fall
and/or our
common stock price increases, and decrease as interest rates
rise and/or
our common stock price decreases. The interest and market value
changes affect the fair value of our Notes, but do not impact
our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations due
to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. We do not carry the
Notes at fair value, but present the fair value of the principal
amount of our Notes for disclosure purposes. As of
April30, 2010, the principal amount of our Notes, which
consists of the combined debt and equity components, was
$1265billion, and the total estimated fair value of such
was $15billion based on the closing trading price of $120
per $100 of our Notes as of that date.   Foreign
Currency Exchange Rate Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward
Contracts   We hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to
minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange
rates on earnings. We utilize forward and option contracts to
hedge against the short-term impact of foreign currency
fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies. All balance sheet hedges are marked to
market through earnings every period. We also use foreign
exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted
transactions related to forecasted sales transactions. These
derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under accounting
guidance for derivatives and hedging. For cash flow hedges
outstanding at April30, 2010, the time-value component is
recorded in earnings while all other gains or losses were
included in other comprehensive income.   We do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative
or trading purposes. In entering into forward and option foreign
exchange contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise
from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms
of their contracts. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit
risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with creditworthy
multinational commercial banks. All contracts have a maturity of
less than one year.   The following table provides information about our currency
forward contracts outstanding on April30, 2010 and

Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of   NetApp, Inc.   Sunnyvale, California   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
NetApp, Inc. and subsidiaries collectively, the
Company as of April30, 2010 and
April24, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, cash flows, and stockholders equity and
comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period
ended April30, 2010. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in . These
consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of April30, 2010 and April24, 2009, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended April30, 2010, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.   We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
April30, 2010, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated June18, 2010 expressed an
unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over
financial reporting.   /s/DELOITTE

Significant
Accounting Policies   Fiscal Year We operate on a 52-week or
53-week year ending on the last Friday in April. Fiscal 2010 was
a 53-week fiscal year and fiscal 2009 and 2008 were 52-week
fiscal years.   Basis of Presentation The consolidated
financial statements include the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions are
eliminated in consolidation.   Financial Statements Presentation Certain
prior period amounts have been combined in the accompanying
financial statements to conform to current year presentation.   Retrospective Application of Accounting Standard to
Previously Issued Financial Statements In May
2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
updated guidance which required that the liability and equity
components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled
in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement be
separately accounted for in a manner that reflects an
issuers non-convertible debt borrowing rate. The guidance
applied to the $1265billion aggregate principal amount of
175%Convertible Senior Notes the Notes and was adopted
by us on a retrospective basis as of April24, 2009 and for
the fiscal year then ended.   Use of Estimates The preparation of the
consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates
include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, reserve
and allowances; inventory valuation and purchase order accruals;
valuation of goodwill and intangibles; restructuring reserves;
product warranties; self-insurance; stock-based compensation;
loss contingencies; investment impairments; income taxes, and
fair value measurements. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.   Financial Instruments For certain financial
instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other
current liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate their fair
value due to the relatively short maturity of these balances.
The following methods were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable
to estimate that value   Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all
highly liquid debt investments with original maturities of three
months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash
equivalents consist primarily of money market funds, for which
the carrying amounts are reasonable estimates of fair value.
Cash equivalents are recognized at fair value.   Short-Term Investments.Short-term investments
consist of marketable debt or equity securities which are
classified as
available-for-sale
and are recognized at fair value. The determination of fair
value is further detailed in Note9 of the accompanying
consolidated financial statements. We regularly review our
investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that
have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in
determining whether a loss is
other-than-temporary
include: the length of time and extent to which the fair market
value has been lower than the cost basis, the financial
condition and near-term prospects of the investee, credit
quality, likelihood of recovery, and our intent and ability to
hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for
any anticipated

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   recovery in fair market value. We classify our investments as
current or noncurrent based on the nature of the investments and
their availability for use in current operations.   Unrealized gains and temporary losses, net of related taxes, are
included with accumulated other comprehensive income loss
AOCI. Upon realization, those amounts are reclassified from
AOCI to results of operations. The amortization of premiums and
discounts on the investments and realized gains and losses
related to investments are included in results of operations.
Other-than-temporary
impairments on
available-for-sale
debt securities are determined to be either credit losses or
losses due to other factors. Credit losses are recognized in our
results of operations and other losses are included in AOCI.   Investments in Privately-held Companies We
have certain investments in privately-held companies, which we
account for under the cost method, subject to periodic reviews
for impairment.   Fair Value Measurements and Impairments All
of our
available-for-sale
investments and nonmarketable equity securities are subject to a
periodic impairment review. Investments are considered to be
impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be
other-than-temporary.
This determination requires significant judgment.   For publicly traded investments, impairment is determined based
upon the specific facts and circumstances present at the time,
including factors such as current economic and market
conditions, the credit rating of the securitys issuer, the
length of time an investments fair value has been below
our carrying value, the extent to which fair value was below
cost, and our ability and intent to hold investments for a
period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in
value. If an investments decline in fair value, caused by
factors other than changes in interest rates, is deemed to be
other-than-temporary,
we reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value, as
determined based on quoted market prices or liquidation values.
Declines in value judged to be
other-than-temporary,
if any, are recorded in operations as incurred.   For long-term investments, such as auction rate securities,
impairment is determined based on fair value and marketability
of these investments. The valuation models we used to estimate
fair value included numerous assumptions such as assessments of
the underlying structure of each security, expected cash flows,
discount rates, credit ratings, workout periods, and overall
capital market liquidity.   For nonmarketable investments, impairment is based on the most
recent information available to us, including new financings or
estimates of current fair value, as well as through traditional
valuation techniques. It is our policy to review the fair value
of these investments on a regular basis to determine whether the
investments in these companies are
other-than-temporarily
impaired. In the case of privately-held companies, this
evaluation is based on information that we request from these
companies. If we believe the carrying value of an investment is
in excess of fair value, and this difference is
other-than-temporary,
it is our policy to write down the investment to fair value.   Inventories Inventories are stated at the
lower of cost or market, which approximates actual cost on a
first-in,
first out basis. We write down for excess and obsolete inventory
based on the difference between the cost of inventory and the
estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future demand
and market conditions. In addition, we record a liability for
firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with
contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of
our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of
excess and obsolete inventory.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Property and Equipment Property and equipment
are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization is computed
using the straight-line method, generally over the following
periods   	
Depreciation Life years   Buildings   40years   Building improvements   10years   Furniture and fixtures   5years   Computer, production, engineering, and other equipment and
purchased software   3 to 5years   Leasehold improvements   Shorter of remaining lease term or useful life   Construction in progress will be amortized over the estimated
useful lives of the respective assets when they are ready for
their intended use.   Software Development Costs The costs for the
development of new software products and substantial
enhancements to existing software products are expensed as
incurred until technological feasibility has been established,
at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in
accordance with the accounting guidance for software. Because
our current process for developing software is essentially
completed concurrently with the establishment of technological
feasibility, which occurs upon the completion of a working
model, no costs have been capitalized for any of the periods
presented.   Sales and Value Added Taxes Taxes collected
from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are
presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations.   Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets
Goodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for an
acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and
intangible assets acquired. Acquisition-related intangible
assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
economic lives of five years for patents, four to five years for
existing technology, two to eight years for customer
relationships and two to seven years for trademarks and
tradenames as we believe this method would most closely reflect
the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets will be
consumed.   Goodwill is measured and tested for impairment on an annual
basis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more
frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist.
Triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such
as adverse industry or economic trends, restructuring actions,
lower projections of profitability, or a sustained decline in
our market capitalization. The performance of the test involves
a two-step process. The first step requires comparing the fair
value of the each of our reporting units to its net book value,
including goodwill. We have three reporting units, the fair
value of which is determined based on an allocation of our
entity level market capitalization, as determined through quoted
market prices. A potential impairment exists if the fair value
of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value. The
second step of the process is only performed if a potential
impairment exists, and it involves determining the difference
between the fair value of the reporting units net assets
other than goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit and
if the difference is less than the net book value of goodwill,
an impairment exists and is recorded. We have not been required
to perform this second step of the process because the fair
value of our reporting units has exceeded the net book value at
every measurement date.   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review the
carrying values of long-lived assets whenever events and
circumstances, such as reductions in demand, lower projections
of profitability, significant changes in the manner of our use
of acquired assets, or significant negative industry or economic
trends, indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be
recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and
eventual disposition. If this review indicates that there is an
impairment, the impaired asset is written down to its fair
value, which is typically calculated using: iquoted
market prices
and/or
iidiscounted expected future cash flows utilizing a
discount rate. Our estimates regarding future anticipated net
revenue and cash flows, the remaining economic life of the
products and technologies, or both, may differ from those used
to assess the recoverability of assets. In that event,

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   charges or shortened useful lives of certain long-lived assets
may be required, resulting in a reduction in net income or an
increase to net loss in the period when such determinations are
made.   Derivative Instruments Derivatives that are
not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through
earnings. If the derivative is designated as a hedge, depending
on the nature of the exposure being hedged, changes in fair
value will either be offset against the change in fair value of
the hedged items through earnings or recognized in AOCI until
the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective
portion of the hedge is recognized in earnings immediately.   As a result of our significant international operations, we are
subject to risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates. We
use derivative financial instruments, principally currency
forward contracts and currency options, to attempt to minimize
the impact of exchange rate movements on our balance sheet and
operating results. Factors that could have an impact on the
effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of
forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets. These
programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the
impact of currency exchange movements. The maturities of these
instruments are generally less than one year.   Currently, we do not enter into any foreign exchange forward
contracts to hedge exposures related to firm commitments or
nonmarketable investments. Cash flows from our derivative
programs are included under operating activities in the
consolidated statement of cash flows with the exception of cash
flows from the derivatives used to hedge the convertible notes
issued June10, 2008. The cash flows related to the Note
hedges are included under financing activities.   Residual GuaranteesWe record
liabilities in other accrued liabilities for the fair value of
residual guarantees relating to certain properties under our
synthetic leases. In the event that the fair values of the
properties, as determined by appraisals, are below the residual
guarantees, we accrue for the deficiencies over the remaining
term of the respective leases.   Revenue Recognition We apply the provisions
of the accounting guidance for software revenue recognition to
our product sales, both hardware and software, because our
software is essential to the performance of our hardware. We
recognize revenue when   
Persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists:It is our customary practice to have a
purchase order
and/or
contract prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement from our
end users, customers, value-added resellers, or distributors.   
Delivery has occurred:Our product is
physically delivered to our customers, generally with standard
transfer terms such as FOB origin. We typically do not allow for
restocking rights with any of our value- added resellers or
distributors. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or
return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria
are achieved. If undelivered products or services exist that are
essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an
arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred.   
The fee is fixed or determinable:Arrangements
with payment terms extending beyond our standard terms,
conditions and practices are not considered to be fixed or
determinable. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized at
the earlier of customer payment or when the fees become due and
payable. We typically do not allow for price-protection rights
with any of our value-added resellers or distributors.   
Collection is probable:If there is
considerable doubt surrounding the credit worthiness of a
customer at the outset of an arrangement, the associated revenue
is deferred and recognized upon cash receipt.   Our multiple element arrangements include our systems and one or
more of the following undelivered software-related elements:
software entitlements and maintenance, premium hardware
maintenance, and storage review services. Our software
entitlements and maintenance entitle our customers to receive
unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a
when-and-if-available
basis, bug fixes, and patch releases. Premium hardware
maintenance services include contracts for technical support and
minimum response times. Revenues from software   
69 Table of Contents   NETAPP,

NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   entitlements and maintenance, premium hardware maintenance
services and storage review services are recognized ratably over
the contractual term, generally from one to three years. We also
offer extended service contracts which extend our standard
parts warranty and may include premium hardware maintenance at
the end of the warranty term; revenues from these contracts are
recognized ratably over the contract term. We typically sell
professional services separately from any of our other revenue
elements, either on a time and materials basis or for fixed
price standard projects; we recognize revenue for these services
as they are performed. Revenue from hardware installation
services is recognized in the period the services are delivered.
For arrangements with multiple elements, we recognize as revenue
the difference between the total arrangement price and the
greater of fair value or stated price for any undelivered
elements the residual method.   For our undelivered software-related elements, we determine fair
value of these undelivered elements based on vendor-specific
objective evidence VSOE of fair value, which for
us consists of the prices charged when these services are sold
separately. To determine the fair value of these elements, we
analyze both the selling prices when elements are sold
separately as well as the concentrations of those prices. We
believe those concentrations have been sufficient to enable us
to establish VSOE of fair value for the undelivered elements. If
VSOE cannot be obtained to establish fair value of the
undelivered elements, it is required that revenue from the
entire arrangement be initially deferred and recognized ratably
over the period these elements are delivered.   For purposes of presentation in the statement of operations,
once fair value has been determined for our undelivered bundled
elements, we allocate revenue first to software entitlements and
maintenance, based on VSOE of its fair value with the remainder
allocated to other service revenues.   We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at
the time of shipment. Sales returns are estimated based on
historical sales returns, current trends, and our expectations
regarding future experience. We monitor and analyze the accuracy
of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and
adjust them for future expectations to determine the adequacy of
our current and future reserve needs. If actual future returns
and allowances differ from past experience, additional
allowances may be required.   Product Warranties Estimated future warranty
costs are expensed as a cost of product revenues when revenue is
recognized, based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred
under our warranty obligations including material, distribution
and labor costs. Our accrued liability for estimated future
warranty costs is included in other accrued liabilities and
other long-term obligations on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. Factors that affect our warranty liability
include the number of installed units, estimated material costs,
estimated distribution costs and estimated labor costs. We
periodically assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual and
adjust the amount as considered necessary.   Foreign Currency Translation For subsidiaries
whose functional currency is the local currency, gains and
losses resulting from translation of these foreign currency
financial statements into U.S.dollars are recorded in
AOCI. For subsidiaries where the functional currency is the
U.S.dollar, gains and losses resulting from the process of
remeasuring foreign currency financial statements into
U.S.dollars are included in other income expenses, net.   Stock-Based Compensation We measure and
recognize stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based
awards, including employee stock options, restricted stock units
and rights to purchase shares under our ESPP, based on their
estimated fair value, and recognize the costs in our financial
statements over the employees requisite service period.   The fair value of employee restricted stock units is equal to
the market value of our common stock on the date the award is
granted. Calculating the fair value of employee stock options
and the rights to purchase shares under the ESPP requires
estimates and significant judgment. The fair value of each
option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model, and is not remeasured as a
result of subsequent stock price fluctuations. Option-pricing
models require the input of highly subjective assumptions,
including the expected term of options, and the expected price
volatility of the stock underlying such options. Our expected
term assumption is based primarily on historical exercise and
post-vesting forfeiture experience. Our stock price volatility
assumption   
70 Table of Contents   NETAPP,
INC.
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   is based on an implied volatility of call options and dealer
quotes on call options, generally having a term of greater than
twelve months. The risk-free interest rate is based upon United
States Treasury bills with equivalent expected terms, and the
expected dividend is based on our history and expected dividend
payouts. Changes in the subjective assumptions required in the
valuation models may significantly affect the estimated value of
our stock-based awards and the related stock-based compensation
expense. Likewise, the shortening of the contractual life of our
options could change the estimated exercise behavior in a manner
other than currently expected.   In addition, we estimate the number of stock-based awards that
will be forfeited due to employee turnover. Our forfeiture
assumption is based primarily on historical experience. Changes
in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect
on reported stock-based compensation expense, as the effect of
adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture
estimate is changed.   Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are provided for temporary differences that will
result in tax deductions or income in future periods, as well as
the future benefit of tax credit carryforwards. A valuation
allowance reduces tax assets to their estimated realizable value.   Determining the liability for uncertain tax positions requires
us to make significant estimates and judgments as to whether,
and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due based on
potential tax audit issues in the U.S.and other tax
jurisdictions throughout the world. Our estimates are based on
the outcomes of previous audits, as well as the precedents set
in cases in which others have taken similar tax positions to
those taken by us. If we later determine that our exposure is
lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our
revised expectations, we adjust the liability and effect a
related change in our tax provision during the period in which
we make such a determination.   The accounting guidance for income taxes prescribes a
comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure,
present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax
positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return
including a decision whether to file or not to file a return in
a particular jurisdiction. We recognize the tax liability for
uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on
the two-step process prescribed in the interpretation. The first
step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that
each income tax position would be sustained upon audit. The
second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the
amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority. Estimating
these amounts requires us to determine the probability of
various possible outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax
positions on a quarterly basis. See Note14 of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for further
discussion.   Net Income per Share Basic net income per
share is computed by dividing income available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding, excluding common shares subject to repurchase for
that period. Diluted net income per share is computed giving
effect to all dilutive potential shares that were outstanding
during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of
incremental common shares subject to repurchase, common shares
issuable upon exercise of stock options, restricted stock
awards, ESPP shares, warrants, and assumed conversion of our
Notes. Repurchased shares are held as treasury stock and our
outstanding shares used to calculate earnings per share have
been reduced by the weighted number of repurchased shares.   
3.
Concentration
of Risk   Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash
equivalents, investments, foreign exchange contracts and
accounts receivable. Cash equivalents and short-term investments
consist primarily of corporate bonds, U.S.government
agency securities, and money market funds, all of which are
considered high investment grade. Our policy is to limit the
amount of credit exposure through diversification and investment
in highly rated securities. We further mitigate concentrations
of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in
the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk
across geographies and type of issuer.   
71 Table of Contents   NETAPP,
INC.
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Our long term investments, including auction rate securities,
have been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to
uncertainties in the credit and capital markets.   In entering into forward foreign exchange contracts, we have
assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of
counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The
counterparties to these contracts are major multinational
commercial banks, and we do not expect any losses as a result of
counterparty defaults.   We sell our products primarily to large organizations in
different industries and geographies. We do not require
collateral or other security to support accounts receivable. In
addition, we maintain an allowance for potential credit losses.
To reduce credit risk, we perform ongoing credit evaluations on
our customers financial condition. We establish an
allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding
the credit risk of customers, historical trends and other
information and, to date, such losses have been within
managements expectations. Concentrations of credit risk
with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the
wide variety of customers who are dispersed across many
geographic regions.   There are no concentrations of business transacted with a
particular market that would severely impact our business in the
near term. However, we currently rely on a limited number of
suppliers for certain key components and a few key contract
manufacturers to manufacture most of our products; any
disruption or termination of these arrangements could materially
adversely affect our operating results.

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards   In June 2009, the FASB issued revised guidance for the
accounting for variable interest entities VIEs. The scope
within the revised standard now includes qualifying
special-purpose entities and provides revised guidance on
1determining the primary beneficiary of the VIE,
2how power is shared, 3consideration for
kick-out, participating and protective rights,
4reconsideration of the primary beneficiary,
5reconsideration of a VIE, 6fees paid to
decision makers or service providers, and 7presentation
requirements. We are required to adopt this standard at the
beginning of fiscal 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact
of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial
statements, but do not expect the adoption to have a material
impact on our financial statements.   In October 2009, the FASB amended the accounting standards for
multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to   iprovide updated guidance on whether multiple
deliverables exist, how the deliverables in an arrangement
should be separated, and how the consideration should be
allocated   iirequire an entity to allocate revenue in an
arrangement using best estimate of selling prices BESP of
deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor-specific objective
evidence of selling price VSOE or third-party evidence of
selling price TPE   iiieliminate the use of the residual method and require
an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price
method;and   ivexpand the disclosure requirements to require an
entity to provide both qualitative and quantitative information
about the significant judgments made in applying the revised
guidance and subsequent changes in those judgments that may
significantly affect the timing or amount of revenue recognition.   In addition, in October 2009, the FASB amended the accounting
standards for revenue recognition to exclude tangible products
containing software components and non-software components that
function together to deliver the tangible products
essential functionality from the scope of the software revenue
recognition guidance. The revised revenue recognition accounting
standards are effective for revenue arrangements entered into or
materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
June15, 2010 and shall be applied on a prospective basis.
Earlier application is permitted. We are required to adopt this
standard at the beginning of fiscal 2012, which begins on

NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   April30, 2011. We are assessing the impact of the new
accounting standards on our financial position and results of
operations.   In January 2010, the FASB issued revised guidance on disclosures
related to fair value measurements. This guidance requires new
disclosures about significant transfers in and out of
Level1 and Level2 and separate disclosures about
purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements with respect to
Level3 measurements. The guidance also clarifies existing
fair value disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs
used to measure fair value. The new disclosures and
clarifications of existing disclosures were effective for us in
fiscal 2010, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales,
issuances, and settlements relating to Level3
measurements, which will be effective for us in the first
quarter of fiscal 2012. We do not expect the adoption to have a
material impact on our financial statements.

Financial
Instruments and Fair Value   We measure assets and liabilities at fair value based upon
expected exit price, representing the amount that would be
received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a
liability, as the case may be, in an orderly transaction between
market participants. As such, fair value may be based on
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an
asset or liability. The accounting guidance provides a framework
for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring
basis whereby inputs, used in valuation techniques, are assigned
a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels
of inputs to measure fair value   Level1:Observable inputs that reflect
quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities
in active markets.   Level2:Inputs reflect quoted prices for
identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for
the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived
principally from or corroborated by observable market data by
correlation or other means.   Level3:Unobservable inputs reflecting
our own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to
determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be
consistent with market participant assumptions that are
reasonably available.   We consider an active market to be one in which transactions for
the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and
volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, and
view an inactive market as one in which there are few
transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not
current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time
or among market makers. Where appropriate, our own or the
counterpartys non-performance risk is considered in
determining the fair values of liabilities and assets,
respectively.

available in active markets. Level1 investments generally
include U.S.Treasuries, trading securities with quoted
prices on active markets, and money market funds.   We classify items in Level2 if the investments are valued
using observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark
yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative
pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
These investments include: corporate bonds, commercial paper,
U.S.government agency bonds, municipal bonds, certificates
of deposit, and foreign currency contracts. Investments are held
by a custodian who obtains investment prices from a third party
pricing provider that incorporates standard inputs in various
asset price models. We corroborate the prices obtained from the
pricing service against other independent sources and, as of
April30, 2010, have not found it necessary to make any
adjustments to the prices obtained.   The unrealized losses on our
available-for-sale
investments in corporate bonds and U.S.government agency
bonds were caused by market value declines as a result of the
recent economic environment, as well as fluctuations in market
interest rates. Because the decline in market value is
attributable to changes in market conditions and not credit
quality, and because we do not intend to sell nor likely be
required to sell these investments prior to a recovery of par
value, we do not consider these investments to be other-than
temporarily impaired at April30, 2010.   Our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are also
classified within Level2. We determine the fair value of
these instruments by considering the estimated amount we would
pay or receive to terminate these agreements at the reporting
date. We use observable inputs, including quoted prices in
active markets for similar assets or liabilities. Our foreign
currency derivative contracts are classified within Level2
as the valuation inputs are based on quoted market prices of
similar instruments in active markets. Gains and losses
generated by hedge assets and liabilities, and the related
derivative instruments were as follows in millions

multiple distributions of its assets to its investors and we
recognized an additional loss of $02million in our income
statement, and as of April30, 2010, we had recovered
$514million of our recorded investment. Future
distributions, if any, will be recognized as income upon receipt.   As of April30, 2010 and April24, 2009, we had
auction rate securities ARSs with a par value of
$738million and $754million, respectively, and an
estimated fair value of $690million and
$665million, respectively, which are classified as
long-term investments. Substantially all of our ARSs are backed
by pools of student loans guaranteed by the U.S.Department
of Education. As of April30, 2010, we recorded cumulative
temporary losses of $26million within AOCI. In addition,
we recorded
other-than-temporary
losses of $21million in other income expense, net,
during fiscal 2009 based on an analysis of the fair value and
marketability of these investments. We estimated the fair value
for each individual ARS using an income discounted cash flow
approach that incorporates both observable and unobservable
inputs to discount the expected future cash flows. Based on our
ability to access our cash and other short-term investments, our
expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we
do not intend to sell these investments prior to recovery of
value. We will continue to monitor our ARS investments in light
of the current debt market environment and evaluate our
accounting for these investments.   As of April30, 2010 and April24, 2009, we held
investments in a private equity fund of $14million and
$20million, respectively. In addition, at April24,
2009, we held equity investments in privately held companies of
$19million. During fiscal 2010, we recorded gains of
$34million on these investments. During fiscal 2009, we
recorded $63million of impairment charges on certain of
these investments and adjusted their carrying amount to fair
value, as we deemed the decline in the value of those assets to
be
other-than-temporary.   The table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning and
ending balance of our Level3 financial assets measured at

Arrangements   175%Convertible
Senior Notes Due 2013   On June10, 2008, we issued $1,2650million aggregate
principal amount of 175%Convertible Senior Notes due
2013. The Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of the
Company. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually at a rate of
175% per annum. The Notes will mature on June1, 2013
unless repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms
prior to such date. The Notes may be converted, under the
conditions specified below, based on an initial conversion rate
of 3140shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount
of Notes which represents an initial effective conversion price
of the Notes of approximately $3185 per share, subject to
adjustment as described in the indenture governing the Notes. We
received net proceeds of $1,2384million, after deducting
issuance costs of $266million.   The Notes are not redeemable by us prior to the maturity date.
In the event of a fundamental change, holders of the Notes may
require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes at a
repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.   The holders of the Notes may convert their Notes until the close
of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding
the maturity date if any of the following conditions are met:
1during the five business day period after any five
consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which
the trading price of the Notes for each day in the measurement
period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported
sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the
Notes on each such day; 2during any calendar quarter
and only during such calendar quarter if the last reported
sale price of our common stock for 20 or more trading days in a
period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading
day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130%
of the applicable conversion price in effect for the Notes on
the last trading day of such immediately preceding calendar
quarter; or 3upon the occurrence of specified corporate
transactions set forth in the indenture for the Notes. On or
after March1, 2013 until the scheduled trading day
immediately preceding the maturity date, holders of the Notes
may convert their Notes regardless of the foregoing conditions.
Upon conversion, a holder will receive cash in an amount equal
to the lesser of the conversion value and the principal amount
of the Notes, and any shares of our common stock for any
conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the Notes,
if any. Holders of the Notes who convert their Notes in
connection with a fundamental change as defined in the
indenture for the Notes will, under certain circumstances, be
entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in
the conversion rate.   As of April30, 2010, none of the conditions allowing the
holders of the Notes to convert had been met and we had not
issued any shares related to the Notes. Based on the closing
price of our common stock of $3467 on April30, 2010, the
if-converted value of our Notes exceeded their principal amount
by approximately $112million.   We separately account for the liability and equity components of
the Notes. The initial debt component of the Notes was valued at
$1,0170million based on the contractual cash flows
discounted at an appropriate comparable market non-convertible
debt borrowing rate at the date of issuance of 631%, with the
equity component representing the residual amount of the
proceeds of $2480million which was recorded as a debt
discount. Issuance costs were allocated pro rata based on the
relative initial carrying amounts of the debt and equity
components. As a result, $52million of the issuance costs
were allocated to the equity component of the Notes, and
$214million of the issuance costs remained classified as
long-term other assets. The debt discount and the issuance costs
allocated to the debt component are amortized as additional
interest expense over the term of the Notes using the effective
interest method and an effective interest rate of 631% for all
periods presented.

Hedges and Warrants   Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we purchased note
hedges and sold warrants. The separate note hedge and warrants
transactions are structured to reduce the potential future
economic dilution associated with the conversion of the Notes.
Each of these components is discussed separately below   
Note Hedges.Counterparties agreed to sell the
Company up to approximately 397million shares, subject to
anti-dilution adjustments, of our common stock, which is the
number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the Notes
in full, at a price of $3185 per share, subject to adjustment.
The note hedge transactions will be settled in shares in an
amount generally equal to the number of shares the Company would
deliver to holders that convert their Notes. The note hedge
transactions will expire at the earlier of 1the last day
on which any Notes remain outstanding and 2the scheduled
trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the
Notes. The cost of the Note hedges was $2549million and
has been accounted for as an equity transaction.   
Warrants.We also sold to the same
counterparties warrants to acquire, subject to anti-dilution
adjustments, 397million shares of our common stock at an
exercise price of $4128 per share, subject to adjustment, on a
series of days commencing on September3, 2013. Upon
exercise of the warrants, we have the option to deliver cash or
shares of our common stock equal to the difference between the
then market price and the strike price of the warrants.   As of April30, 2010, we had not received any shares
related to the note hedge transactions or delivered cash or
shares related to the warrant transactions. We received proceeds
of $1631million related to the sale of the warrants,
which has been classified as equity.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives, Inc. Lehman OTC
was the counterparty to 20% of our Note hedges. The bankruptcy
filing by Lehman OTC on October3, 2008 constituted an
event of default under the hedge transaction. In
April 2010, we terminated the hedge transaction with Lehman OTC
in exchange for an unsecured bankruptcy claim, which we
subsequently sold to a third party for $142million.
Because we have decided not to replace the hedge, we are subject
to potential dilution on the 20% unhedged portion of our Notes
upon conversion if on the date of conversion the per-share
market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of
$3185. The terms of the Notes, the rights of the holders of the
Notes and other counterparties to Note hedges and warrants were
not affected by the termination of this hedge.   Fair
Value of Notes   As of April30, 2010, the approximate fair value of the
principal amount of our Notes, which includes the debt and
equity components, was approximately $15 billion, or 120% of
the face value of the Notes, based upon quoted market
information.   Credit
Agreements   On November2, 2007, we entered into a senior unsecured
credit agreement the Unsecured Credit Agreement
with certain lenders and BNP Paribas BNP, as
syndication agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank National Association
JPMorgan, as administrative agent. The Unsecured
Credit Agreement provided for a revolving unsecured credit
facility that is comprised of commitments from various lenders
who agree to make revolving loans and swingline loans and issue
letters of credit of up to an aggregate amount of
$2500million with a term of five years. Effective
December22, 2009, we terminated this agreement. No
borrowings were outstanding at the time of termination and no
penalties resulted from these early terminations.   On October5, 2007, we entered into a secured credit
agreement the Secured Credit Agreement. The
Secured Credit Agreement provided for a revolving secured credit
facility of up to $2500million with a term of five years.
In fiscal 2009, we terminated this agreement. No borrowings were
outstanding at the time of termination and no penalties resulted
from these early terminations.

Common Stock directly; ivthe Performance Share and
Performance Unit Program also known as restricted stock units
or RSUs under which eligible persons may be granted performance
shares and performance units which result in payment to the
participant only if performance goals or other vesting criteria
are achieved; and vthe Automatic Option Grant Program
under which nonemployee board members automatically receive

employees, nonemployee directors, and consultants and other
independent advisors options to purchase shares of our common
stock during their period of service with us. The exercise price
for an incentive stock option and a nonstatutory option cannot
be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock
on the grant date. Options granted under the 1999 Plan generally
vest over a four-year period. Options granted prior to
April29, 2006, have a term of no more than 10years
after the date of grant and those granted after April29,
2006 have a term of no more than seven years, subject to earlier
termination upon the occurrence of certain events. The 1999 Plan
prohibits the repricing of any outstanding stock option or stock
appreciation right after it has been granted or to cancel any
outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right and
immediately replace it with a new stock option or stock
appreciation right with a lower exercise price unless approved
by stockholders. RSUs granted under the 1999 Plan generally vest
over a four-year period with 25% of the units vesting on each
annual anniversary of the grant date. The 1999 Plan limits the
number of shares issued under the Stock Issuance Program and the
Performance Share and Performance Unit Program to
89million shares plus 50% of the awards cancelled and
returned to the 1999 Plan and 50% of the number of shares added

limits the value of performance units a participant may receive
during any calendar year to $20million. The 1999 Plan
expires in August 2019.   In fiscal 2010, the 1999 Plan was not amended to increase
addition shares for issuance. In fiscal 2009 and 2008, 1999 Plan
was amended to increase the share reserved by an additional
66million and 72million shares for issuance under
the plan, respectively. As of April30, 2010,
155million shares were available for grant under our

applicable taxes and decreases the shares issued to the employee
by a corresponding value. The number and the value of the shares

Option Exchange   In April 2009, our stockholders approved a stock option exchange
program the Exchange pursuant to which eligible employees were
able to exchange some or all of their outstanding options with
an exercise price greater than or equal to $2200 per share that
were granted before June20, 2008, whether vested or
unvested, for new RSUs. In connection with the Exchange, we
exchanged options to purchase 245million shares of our
common stock for total of 32million RSUs. The fair value
of the RSUs issued was measured as the total of the unrecognized
compensation cost of the options surrendered and the incremental
value of the RSUs issued, measured as the excess of the fair
value of the RSUs over the fair value of the options tendered
immediately before the exchange. The incremental cost of the
RSUs was $58million. The value of the RSUs, totaling
$701million, is being amortized over the weighted average
vesting period of the RSUs of 35years.

Derivatives
and Hedging Activities   We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign
currency risk. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is
to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated
with changes in foreign currency. The program is not designated
for trading or speculative purposes. Our derivatives expose us
to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be
unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We seek to mitigate
such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial
institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any
one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is
monitored on an ongoing basis. We also have in place a master
netting arrangement to mitigate the credit risk of our
counterparty and potentially to reduce our losses due to
counterparty nonperformance. All contracts have a maturity of
less than six months.   Our major foreign currency exchange exposures and related
hedging programs are described below   Balance Sheet.We utilize monthly foreign
currency forward and options contracts to hedge exchange rate
fluctuations related to certain foreign monetary assets and
liabilities. These derivative instruments do not subject us to
material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements
because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to
offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being
hedged and the net amount is included in earnings.   Forecasted Transactions.We use currency
forward contracts to hedge exposures related to forecasted sales
denominated in certain foreign currencies. These contracts are
designated as cash flow hedges and in general closely match the
underlying forecasted transactions in duration. The contracts
are carried on the balance sheet at

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   fair value, and the effective portion of the contracts
gains and losses is recorded as AOCI until the forecasted
transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we
reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to
revenues. If the underlying forecasted transactions do not
occur, or it becomes probable that they will not occur, the gain
or loss on the related cash flow hedge is recognized immediately
in earnings. We measure the effectiveness of hedges of
forecasted transactions on a monthly basis by comparing the fair
values of the designated currency forward contracts with the
fair values of the forecasted transactions. Any ineffective
portion of the derivative hedging gain or loss as well as
changes in the fair value of the derivatives time value
which are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
is recognized in current period earnings.   Over the next twelve months, it is expected that
$07million of derivative net losses recorded in AOCI as
of April30, 2010 will be reclassified into earnings as an
adjustment to revenues. The maximum length of time over which
forecasted foreign denominated revenues are hedged is six months.   The notional value of our outstanding currency forward contracts

STATEMENTSContinued   In addition, we are effectively subject to federal tax
examination adjustments for tax years ended on or after fiscal
year 2000, in that we have net operating loss carryforwards from
these years that could be subject to adjustment, if and when
utilized.   We are currently undergoing federal and state income tax audits
in the United States and several foreign tax jurisdictions. The
rights to some of our intellectual property IP are
owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are
made between foreign and U.S.tax jurisdictions relating to
the use of this IP in a qualified cost sharing arrangement.
Recently, several other U.S.companies have had their
foreign IP arrangements challenged as part of IRS examinations,
which have resulted in material proposed assessments
and/or
pending litigation. Effective September27, 2007, the
IRSs Large and Mid-Sized Business Division
LMSB released a Coordinated Issues Paper
CIP with respect to qualified cost sharing
arrangements CSAs. Specifically, this CIP provides
guidance to IRS personnel concerning methods that may be applied
to evaluate the arms length charge buy-in payment for
internally developed pre-existing as well as
acquisition-related intangible property that is made available
to a qualified CSA. During fiscal year 2009 we received Notices
of Proposed Adjustments from the IRS in connection with a
federal income tax audit of our fiscal 2003 and 2004 tax year
tax returns. We recently filed a protest with the IRS in
response to the Notices of Proposed Adjustments. The Notices of
Proposed Adjustments focus primarily on issues of the timing and
the amount of income recognized and deductions taken during the
audit years and on the level of cost allocations made to foreign
operations during the audit years. If upon the conclusion of
these audits the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any
of these tax jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax
provision we have recorded in the applicable period or
subsequently reserved for, our overall tax provision and
effective tax rate may be adversely impacted. It is reasonably
possible the company will reach a final settlement with the IRS
on the 2003 2004 audit within the next twelve months.   On March22, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit held in Xilinx Inc.v. Commissioner that
pre-2004 cost sharing regulations do not require stock-based
compensation to be included in the research and development cost
base of companies that have entered into a CSA and, therefore,
the stock-based compensation does not have to be allocated among
the participants. The Courts ruling impacts our estimate
of tax benefits required to be recognized under accounting
guidance. As a result of the revised ruling, we released the
liability established in our first quarter of fiscal 2010 of
$386million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. For
fiscal 2010, there was no net income tax expense impact.   We do not include unrealized stock option attributes as
components of our gross deferred tax assets and corresponding
valuation allowance disclosures. The tax effected amounts of
gross unrealized net operating loss and business tax credit
carryforwards, and their corresponding valuation allowance have
been excluded as of April30, 2010 are $3586million,
which will result in additional paid in capital if and when
realized as a reduction in taxes otherwise paid.   As of April30, 2010, the amount of accumulated unremitted
earnings from our foreign subsidiaries is approximately
$1,1810million.   Network Appliance Systems India Pvt. Ltd., our Indian
subsidiary, received a tax holiday from the Indian tax
authorities attributed to its call center and research and
development activities effective June6, 2003. These
activities qualify under the Software Technology Park of India
STPI incentive for the development and manufacture
of computer software and information technology enabled
services. Under this tax holiday, net taxable income derived
from call center and research and development activities is
exempt from Indian taxation. This tax holiday is set to expire
on March31, 2011. Notwithstanding qualification for this
tax holiday, minimum alternate tax rules in India effective for
us as of fiscal 2009 override the full tax exemption. For fiscal
2010, we were subject to a minimum alternate tax on this income
in India at a rate of 1699%. The minimum alternate tax paid is
eligible for credit against regular tax paid in future years.
The credits may be carried forward for ten years.

STATEMENTSContinued   In April 2010 our Dutch subsidiary received a favorable tax
ruling from the Dutch tax authorities effective May1, 2010
that replaces the previous Dutch tax ruling that expired on
April30, 2010. This ruling results in both a lower level
of earnings subject to tax in the Netherlands and an extension
of the expiration date to April30, 2015.   As of April30, 2010, the federal, and state net operating
loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately
$7935million and $1700million, respectively. The
federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in
fiscal 2021. State net operating losses of $64million
will expire in fiscal years 2011 through 2013;
$106million will expire in fiscal year 2014 while the
remaining $1529million will expire in fiscal years 2015
through 2030.   As of April30, 2010, we had federal and state tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $901million and
$820million, respectively, available to offset future
income tax liabilities. Federal tax credit carryforwards of
$496million will begin to expire in fiscal years 2015
through 2022, while the remaining $404million will expire
in fiscal years beginning 2023. State tax credits of
$004million will expire in fiscal years 2011 through
2013, while the remaining $819million is available
indefinitely to reduce cash taxes otherwise payable. As
discussed above, most of the net operating loss and tax credit
carryovers, if realized, will be recognized as additional paid
in capital in that they are employee stock option tax attributes.

arrangements under which we could be called upon to make
payments to our third-party funding companies in the event of
nonpayment by end-user customers. Under the terms of the
nonrecourse leases, we do not have any continuing obligations or
liabilities to the third-party leasing companies. Under the
terms of the recourse leases, which are generally three years or
less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease
payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of
end-user customer default. These arrangements are generally
collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets.
Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenues associated
with the end-user financing arrangement in accordance with our
revenue recognition policies. As of April30, 2010, the
maximum guaranteed payment contingencies under our financing
arrangements totaled approximately $767million; and the
related deferred revenue and cost of revenues totaled
approximately $815million and $97million,

NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   these guarantees since the maximum amount of potential future
payments under such guarantees, indemnities and warranties is
not determinable, other than as described above.   Legal
Contingencies   We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which may
arise in the normal course of business.   On September5, 2007, we filed a patent infringement
lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory
damages and a permanent injunction against Sun Microsystems. On
October25, 2007, SunMicrosystems filed a counter
claim against us in the Eastern District of Texas seeking
compensatory damages and a permanent injunction. On
October29, 2007, Sun filed a second lawsuit against us in
the Northern District of California asserting additional patents
against us. The Texas court granted a joint motion to transfer
the Texas lawsuit to the Northern District of California on
November26, 2007. On March26, 2008, Sun filed a
third lawsuit in federal court that extends the patent
infringement charges to storage management technology we
acquired in January 2008.   In January 2010, Oracle acquired Sun. The three lawsuits are
currently in the discovery and motion phase and no trial dates
have been set, so we are unable at this time to determine the
likely outcome of these various patent litigations. Since we are
unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any
potential settlement, no accrual has been recorded as of
April30, 2010.

Controls
and Procedures   
a
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Disclosure Controls are procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under
the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the U.S.Securities and Exchange
Commissions rules and forms. Disclosure Controls are also
designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.   Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in
Rules13a-15e
and
15d-15e
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the
end of the period covered by this report the Evaluation
Date. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the
Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective such that the information relating to NetApp,
including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be
disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission
SEC reports iis recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms, and iiis accumulated and communicated
to NetApps management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Managements
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act
Rule13a-15f.
Our internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.   Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that,
as of April30, 2010, our internal control over financial
reporting was effective based on those criteria.   The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of April30, 2010 has been audited by
Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is
included herein.   
c
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting as defined in
Rule13a-15f
under the Exchange Act identified in connection with
managements evaluation during our last fiscal quarter that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
effect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of   NetApp, Inc.   Sunnyvale, California   We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
NetApp, Inc. and subsidiaries collectively, the
Company as of April30, 2010, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Managements Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on the Companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
companys principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
by the companys board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.   In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of April30, 2010, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.   We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule as of and for the year ended April30, 2010 of the
Company and our report dated June18, 2010 expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial
statement schedule.   /s/DELOITTE
