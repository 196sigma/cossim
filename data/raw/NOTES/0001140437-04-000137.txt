In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Bluefly, Inc. and its subsidiary at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion,
the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial

made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

1.   THE COMPANY
Bluefly, Inc., a Delaware corporation, the Company, is a leading
Internet retailer of designer fashions and home accessories at discount
prices. The Company sells over 350 brands of designer apparel,
accessories and home products at discounts off retail value.
Bluefly.com, a Web site that sells end-of-season and excess inventory of
apparel and accessories was launched in September 1998.
The Company has sustained net losses and negative cash flows from
operations since the formation of Bluefly.com. The Company ability to
meet its obligations in the ordinary course of business is dependent
upon its ability to establish profitable operations or raise additional
financing through public or private debt or equity financing, or other
sources of financing to fund operations. Management believes that its
current funds, together with the January 2004 Financing see Note 12
and working capital will be sufficient to enable the Company to meet its
planned expenditures through December 31, 2004. The Company may seek
additional equity or debt financings to maximize the growth of its
business or if anticipated operating results are not achieved. If such
financings are not available on terms acceptable to the Company, and/or
the Company does not achieve its sales plan, future operations will need
to be modified, scaled back or discontinued.
2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting
Bulletin SAB 101 No. 101 Revenue Recognition in the Financial
Statements, as amended. Gross sales consists primarily of revenue from
product sales and shipping and handling charges and is net of
promotional discounts. Net sales represent gross sales, less provisions
for returns, credit card chargebacks and adjustments for uncollected
sales tax. Revenue is recognized when all the following criteria are
met.  A customer executes an order via the Company website.  The product price and the shipping and handling fee have been
determined.  Credit card authorization has occurred and collection is
reasonably assured.  The product has been shipped and received by the customer.
Shipping and handling billed to customers are classified as revenue in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Task
Force Emerging Issues Task Force EITF No. 00-10, Accounting for
Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs EITF No. 00-10.
PROVISIONS FOR SALES RETURNS AND DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS
The Company generally permits returns for any reason within 90 days of
the sale. The Company performs credit card authorizations and checks the
verifications of its customers prior to shipment of merchandise.
Accordingly, the Company establishes a reserve for estimated future
sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts at the time of
shipment based primarily on historical data. Accounts receivable is
presented on the consolidated balance sheet net of the allowance for
doubtful accounts. As
F-6 BLUEFLY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2003
- 
of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the allowance for doubtful accounts was
$40,000 and $50,000, respectively, and the allowance for sales returns
was $2,528,000 and $1,725,000, respectively.
Deferred revenue, which consists primarily of goods shipped to customers
but not yet received and customer credits, totaled approximately
$1,252,000 and $885,000 as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.
INVENTORIES
Inventories, which consist of finished goods, are stated at the lower of
cost or market. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out FIFO
method. The Company reviews its inventory levels in order to identify
slow-moving merchandise and in some instances uses markdowns below cost
to clear merchandise. Inventory reserves are established based on
historical data and management best estimate of excess inventory.
Inventory may be marked down below cost if management determines that
the inventory stock will not sell at its currently marked price.
Inventory is presented net of reserves on the consolidated balance sheet
As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, inventories, net consists of the
following                                  2003       2002
Inventory on hand                $  10,755,000  $  10,591,000
Inventory to be received due to returns       1,258,000      837,000
Inventory reserves                  673,000     560,000
Total inventories, net             $  11,340,000  $  10,868,000
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost net of depreciation. Equipment
and software are depreciated on a straight-line basis over two to seven
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their
estimated useful lives or the term of the lease. Lease amortization is
included in depreciation expense. Maintenance and repairs are expensed
as incurred.
Certain equipment held under capital leases is classified as property
and equipment and amortized using the straight-line method over the
lease terms and the related obligations are recorded as liabilities.
Costs related to the upgrade and development of the Web Site are
accounted for in accordance with EITF Issue No. 00-02 Accounting for
Website Development Costs, and to the extent they capitalized, are
amortized over 24 months.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company policy is to evaluate long-lived assets for possible
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. This evaluation
is based on a number of factors, including expectations for operating
income and undiscounted cash flows that will result from the use of such
assets. The Company has not identified any such impairment of assets.

INCOME TAXES
The Company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities on the
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in
which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred
taxes of a change in tax rates is realized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. In addition, valuation allowances are
established when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets
will not be realized.
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
At December 31, 2003, the Company has two stock-based employee
compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 8. The
Company accounts for those plans under the recognition and measurement
principles of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations.
No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income, as
all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the
market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant.
The following table illustrates the effect on net loss and loss per
share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions
of Financial Accounting Standards No. SFAS 123 Accounting for Stock

not indicative of future amounts, as additional stock option awards are
anticipated in future years.
NET LOSS PER SHARE
The Company calculated net loss per share in accordance with SFAS No.
128, Earnings Per Share. Basic loss per share excludes dilution and is
computed by dividing loss available to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. For
purposes of calculating basic and diluted loss per share, the Company
presents the amount of dividends earned but unpaid on the face of the
statement of operations.
Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing loss available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period, adjusted to reflect potentially dilutive securities. Due
to the loss, the following shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to
options, warrants, Preferred Stock and Notes Payable were not included
in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the result of
such inclusion would be antidilutive                    F-8 BLUEFLY, INC.

MARKETING EXPENSES
In addition to marketing salaries, marketing expenses consist primarily
of online advertising, print advertising, direct mail campaigns as well
as the related external production costs. The costs associated with
online and print advertising are expensed as incurred, while the costs
associated with direct mail campaigns are capitalized and charged to
expense over the expected future revenue stream. There were no amounts
associated with direct mail campaigns capitalized at December 31, 2003
and 2002. Marketing expenses excluding marketing and public relations
salaries and related salary expenses of $628,000, $553,000 and $832,000
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 amounted to
approximately $1,270,000, $1,722,000 and $4,026,000, respectively.
FULFILLMENT EXPENSES
The Company utilizes a third party to perform all of its order
fulfillment including warehousing, administrative support, returns
processing and receiving labor. For the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, fulfillment expenses totaled $2,776,000, $2,622,000 and
$2,290,000, respectively. These amounts are included in selling,
marketing and fulfillment expenses in the statement of operations.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts of the Company financial instruments, including
cash and cash equivalents, other assets, accounts payable, accrued
liabilities, and notes payable to related party shareholders approximate
fair value due to their short maturities.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51. FIN 46 requires an
investor to consolidate a variable interest entity if it is determined
that the investor is a primary beneficiary of that entity, subject to
the criteria set forth in FIN 46. Assets, liabilities, and non
controlling interests of newly consolidated variable interest entities
will be initially measured at fair value. After initial measurement, the
consolidated variable interest entity will be accounted for under the
guidance provided by Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated
Financial Statements. FIN 46 is effective for variable interest
entities created or entered into after January 31, 2003. For variable
interest entities created or acquired before February 1, 2003, FIN 46
applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after
December 15, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46 will not have a material
impact on the Company consolidated financial statements.
In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133
on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS No. 149. SFAS
No. 149 clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial
net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative as
F-9 BLUEFLY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2003
- 
discussed in Statement No. 133. It also specifies when a derivative
contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 149 amends certain other
existing pronouncements in order to improve consistency in reporting
these types of transactions. The new guidance is effective for contracts
entered into or modified after September 30, 2003, and for hedging
relationships designated after September 30, 2003. The Company adopted
this standard and it did not have a material impact on its consolidated
financial statements.
In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 150 Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity SFAS No. 150. SFAS
No. 150 established standards for classification and measurement in the
statement of financial position of certain financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires
classification of a financials instrument that is within its scope as a
liability or an asset in some circumstances. SFAS No. 150 is effective
for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003,
and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period
beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company adopted this standard and it
did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements of the prior
periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period
presentation for comparative purposes.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions
include the adequacy of the allowances for sales returns and
recoverability of inventories. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Net deferred tax asset liability   $      -  $      -
The Company is in an accumulated loss position for both financial and
income tax reporting purposes. The Company has U.S. Federal net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $64,910,000 at December
31, 2003 which have expiration dates from 2018 through 2023.
Approximately $51 million of these net operating loss carryforwards
relate to the exercise of employee stock options and any tax benefit
derived therefrom, when realized, will be accounted for as a credit to
additional paid-in-capital rather than a reduction of the income tax
provision. Pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the
usage of these net operating loss carryforwards may be limited due to
changes in ownership that have occurred. The Company has not yet
determined the impact, if any, that changes in ownership have had on net
operating loss carryforwards. The Company provided a full valuation
allowance on the entire deferred tax asset balance to reflect the
uncertainty regarding the realizability of these assets due to operating
losses incurred since inception.

described below.
JUNE 2002 FINANCING
In June 2002, Soros invested $19 million in the Company through the

2002 Financing.
As a result of the June 2002 Financing, the conversion price of the
Series B Preferred Stock decreased from $234 to $157. In accordance
with EITF 00-27, this reduction in the conversion price of the Company
Series B Preferred Stock resulted in the Company recording a beneficial
conversion feature in the approximate amount of $102 million as part of
its financial results for the second quarter of 2002. This non-cash
charge, which is analogous to a dividend, also resulted in an adjustment
to the Company computation of Loss Per Share.
AUGUST 2002 FINANCING
In August 2002, Soros invested an additional $21 million in the
Company, thereby reducing its March 2002 Standby Commitment Amount to
zero. Under the terms of the transaction, the Company issued to Soros

provide the holders thereof with any voting rights, other than with
respect to transactions or actions that would adversely affect the

accordance with EITF 00-27, this reduction in the conversion price of
the Company Series B Preferred Stock resulted in the Company recording

million as part of its financial results for the third quarter of 2002.
This non-cash charge, which is analogous to a dividend, resulted in an
adjustment to the Company computation of Loss Per Share.

Convertible Preferred Stock and 21,368 shares of the Company Series B

in additional financing the 2003 Standby Commitment Amount on a
standby basis at any time prior to January 1, 2004, provided that the

be effected through the purchase of newly-designated shares of Series E

from the issuance of any equity or convertible securities after March

Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock automatically
decreased from $093 to $076 per share. In accordance with EITF 00-27,
the reduction in the conversion price of the Series C Preferred Stock
resulted in the Company recording a beneficial conversion feature in the
approximate amount of $225,000 as part of its financial results for the
first quarter of 2003. This non-cash charge, which is analogous to a
dividend, resulted in an adjustment to the Company computation of Loss
Per Share.

warrants to purchase 25,000 shares of its common stock, exercisable at
any time on or prior to January 28, 2007 at $112 per share to Soros.
The Company valued the warrants using the Black Scholes option pricing
model using the following assumptions: risk free interest rate: 354     volatility 113%, expected life 4 years, zero dividend yield. Using these
factors the warrants were valued at $21,000 and were expensed over the
life of the note. The full amount was expensed in the first quarter of
2003.
In connection with the June 2002 Financing, Soros purchased warrants to
purchase 296,644 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $188
per share. These warrants are exercisable at any time on or prior to May
24, 2007.
In exchange for the March 2002 Standby Agreement, the Company issued to
Soros warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise
price of $168 per share the 20 day trailing average of the closing
sale price of the Company Common Stock on the date of issuance,

warrants using the Black Scholes option pricing model using the
following assumptions: risk free interest rate: 522%, volatility 183     expected life 3 years, zero dividend yield. The Company accounted for
the warrants by crediting additional paid in capital for approximately
$157,000 and capitalizing the amount on the balance sheet. This amount

Financing and July 2003 Financing described above, on a pro rata basis.
WARRANTS TO SUPPLIER
On December 22, 2003 the Company issued warrants to purchase 250,000
shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $234 per share to a
supplier of inventory in exchange for reduced pricing. The warrants are
fully vested and expire on December 22, 2006. The Company valued the
warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model key assumptions:
risk free interest rate: 375%, volatility 85%, expected life 2 years,
zero dividend yield. The total value of $502,500 has been capitalized
and classified as prepaid inventory, $251,000 of which has been
classified within current assets and the remaining $251,000 has been
classified as non current, based on the Company projected inventory
purchases. The Company will reclassify the prepaid inventory when the
inventory is purchased as a component of the inventory cost. The Company
will compare actual utilization vs. budgeted utilization. If actual
utilization is less than budgeted utilization the Company will consider
the asset for impairment.

$5,000,000 from $1,500,000; iv redefine the working capital definition
to exclude short-term debt held by affiliates effective as of December
19, 2002; v increase the working capital requirement to $4,000,000
from $3,500,000; vi increase the annual fee the Company pays Rosenthal
for the Loan Facility to $30,000 from $10,000, vii require the Company
to maintain a cash balance of at least $250,000 and; viii require
Soros to increase from $15 million to $20 million the amount of the
standby letter of credit that Soros is maintaining the Soros
Guarantee to help collateralize the Loan Facility and extend the term
of the Soros Guarantee to November 15, 2004 from November 15, 2003. The
Financing Agreement was further amended in the fourth quarter to allow
Rosenthal, in its sole discretion, to increase the amount available
under the Loan Facility subject to the existing $10 million cap by
$500,000.
As of December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately $44 million
available under the Loan Facility. Of the total amount available under
the Loan Facility as of December 31, 2003, approximately $23 million
had been committed, leaving approximately $21 million available against
the Loan Facility. The Company pays interest monthly on the average
daily amount outstanding under the Loan Facility during the preceding
month at a per annum rate equal to the prime rate plus 1% at December
31, 2003 - 500%. For the period ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001
interest expense and fees totaled approximately $77,000, $91,000 and
$26,000 respectively.
In addition to the annual facility fee of $30,000, Rosenthal also
charges fees to open letters of credit and guarantees in an amount equal
to a certain percentage of the face amount of the letter of credit for
each thirty 30 days such letter of credit, or a portion thereof,
remains open.
ROSENTHAL WARRANTS
In consideration for the Loan Facility, among other things, the Company
granted to Rosenthal a first priority lien on substantially all of its
assets, including control of all of its cash accounts upon an event of
default and certain of its cash accounts in the event that the total
amount of monies loaned to the Company under the Loan Facility exceed
90% of the maximum amount available under the Loan Facility for more
than 10 days. Upon inception of the Loan Facility in March 2001, the
Company issued to Rosenthal a warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of
Common Stock at an exercise price of $234, per share exercisable for
five years. The Company valued the warrant using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model key assumptions: risk free interest rate: 486     volatility 117%, expected life 4 years, zero dividend yield and
amortized the fair value of the warrants of $45,000 amount over the life
of the Loan Facility. In March 2002, when the agreement was amended and
as partial consideration for the amendment, the Company extended the
termination date of the warrant it issued to Rosenthal from March 30,
2006 to March 30, 2007. The Company revalued the warrant as of the new
measurement date, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model key
assumptions: risk free interest rate: 525%, volatility 184%, expected
life 3 years, zero dividend yield and credited additional paid in
capital for $80,000. This amount was amortized in full in fiscal 2002.
In November 2003, Rosenthal exercised all their 50,000 warrants.
SOROS WARRANTS IN CONNECTION WITH LOAN FACILITY
In consideration for the Soros Guarantee, the Company agreed to
reimburse Soros for any amounts it pays to Rosenthal pursuant to the
Soros Guarantee and granted to Soros a lien the Soros Lien,
subordinated to the Rosenthal Lien, on substantially all of the
Company assets, including its cash balances, in order to collateralize
its reimbursement obligations.
In connection with the Reimbursement Agreement, the Company issued to
Soros warrants the Soros Upfront Warrants and then issued subsequent
warrants for Soros' agreement to maintain and increase

The Company accounted for the warrants in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 14 APB No. 14 by valuing the warrants

paid in capital for $74,000, $98,000 and $21,000, during the years 2001,
2002 and 2003, respectively. These amounts were amortized to interest
expense over the life of the Loan Facility.

obligations under the Loan Facility, Rosenthal has the right to draw

other things, reimburse Soros for any amounts drawn under such Soros
Guarantee plus interest accrued thereon. In addition, to the extent that

default under the Loan Facility or at any time that the total amount
outstanding exceeds 90% of the Soros Guarantee, the Company will be
required to issue to Soros warrants each a Contingent Warrant to
purchase a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient of a

for ten years from the date of issuance at an exercise price equal to

ten days preceding the ten days after the date of issuance.

all of the Company obligations from Rosenthal at any time during its
term the Buyout Option. With respect to such Buyout Option, Soros
has the right to request that Rosenthal make a draw under the Soros
Guarantee as consideration to Soros for the purchase of such obligation.
