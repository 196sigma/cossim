INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Stockholders
JAKKS Pacific, Inc. and Subsidiaries
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of JAKKS
Pacific, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows and
the financial statement schedule for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999. These financial statements and the financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and the financial
statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and schedule referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
JAKKS Pacific, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the
results of their operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1999
NOTE 1--PRINCIPAL INDUSTRY
JAKKS Pacific, Inc. the Company, a Delaware corporation, is engaged in
the development, production and marketing of toys and children electronics
products, some of which are based on highly-recognized entertainment properties
and character licenses. The Company commenced operations in July 1995 through
the purchase of substantially all of the assets of a Hong Kong toy company. The
Company is marketing its product lines domestically and internationally.
The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in
January 1995.
NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include accounts of the Company and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries. In consolidation, all significant inter-company
balances and transactions are eliminated.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid assets, having an original maturity
of less than three months, to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains its
cash in bank deposits which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The
Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company believes it
is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting periods. Actual future results could differ from those estimates.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognized upon the shipment of goods to customers. Provisions
for estimated defective products and markdowns are made at the time of sale.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
In March 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income. This statement establishes standards for reporting and display of
comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general-purpose
financial statements. This statement requires that all items that are required
to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive
income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same
prominence as other financial statements. This standard requires that an
enterprise classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a
financial statement and display the accumulated balances of other comprehensive
income separately from retained earnings and additional paid-in
32

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1999
capital in the equity section of a statement of financial position. The adoption
of this statement did not have any impact on the Company results of
operations, financial position, or cash flows.
DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS
Costs incurred for financings are deferred when incurred. The deferred
offering costs related to the debentures are amortized over the term of the
debentures, or are written-off upon conversion.
INVENTORY
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or market.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
In 1999 the Company adopted SFAS No. 115 Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt Securities. The marketable securities have been categorized
as trading and as a result are stated at fair value, with unrealized holding
gains and losses included in earnings which were not material at December 31,
1999.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and notes
payable represent financial instruments. The carrying value of these financial
instruments is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost and are being depreciated using
the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives as follows                 
Personal computers. 5 years
Office equipment. 5 years
Furniture and fixtures. 5 - 7 years
Molds and tooling. 2 - 4 years
Leasehold improvements. Shorter of length of lease or 10 years ADVERTISING
Production costs of commercials and programming are charged to operations
in the year during which the production is first aired. The costs of other
advertising, promotion and marketing programs are charged to operations in the
year incurred. Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998
and 1999 was approximately $1,304,000, $3,903,000, and $7,038,000, respectively.
INCOME TAXES
The Company does not file a consolidated return with its foreign
subsidiaries. The Company files Federal and state returns and its foreign
subsidiaries file Hong Kong returns. Deferred taxes
33
35
JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1999
are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized as
deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit
carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary
differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of
changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Monetary assets and liabilities denominational in Hong Kong dollars are
translated into United States dollars at the rate of exchange ruling at the
balance sheet date. Transactions during the period are translated at the rates
ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Profits and losses resulting from the above translation policy are
recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information. This statement requires public business
enterprises to report financial and descriptive information about reportable
segments. This statement also establishes standards for related disclosures
about products and services, geographic areas and major customers. The Company
operates in one reportable segment: the development, production and marketing of
toys and related products.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1998 consolidated financial
statements to conform to the current year presentation.
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair market
value of the assets of acquired toy companies. Goodwill is being amortized over
30 years on a straight-line basis. Accumulated amortization at December 31, 1998
and 1999 totaled $632,519 and $1,381,585, respectively.
The carrying value of goodwill is based on management current assessment
of recoverability. Management evaluates recoverability using both objective and
subjective factors. Objective factors include management best estimates of
projected future earnings and cash flows and analysis of recent sales and
earnings trends. Subjective factors include competitive analysis and the
Company strategic focus.
Intangible assets other than goodwill consist of product technology rights
and trademarks. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis, over
five to thirty years, the estimated economic lives of the related assets.
Accumulated amortization as of December 31, 1998 and 1999 was $1,177,306 and
$1,528,893, respectively.

the joint venture. In addition, it defines the Company preferred returns based
on the joint venture sales. The joint venture profit and loss will be
allocated at 100% to the Company to the extent any preferred return is
distributed, accrued or distributable for such fiscal year. Losses shall be
allocated in accordance with membership interests for so long as the Company has
a positive capital account and thereafter shall be allocated solely to the other
partner. During 1999 the Company earned $3,604,487 in joint venture income.

The provision differs from the expense that would result from applying
Federal statutory rates to income before taxes because of the inclusion of a
provision for state income taxes and the income of the Company foreign
subsidiaries is taxed at a rate of 165% applicable in Hong Kong. In addition,
the provision includes deferred income taxes resulting from adjustments in the
amount of temporary differences. Temporary differences arise primarily from
differences in timing in the deduction of state income taxes and the use of the
straight-line method of depreciation for financial reporting purposes and
accelerated methods of depreciation for tax purposes.
The Company does not file a consolidated return with its foreign
subsidiaries. The Company files Federal and state returns and its foreign
subsidiaries file Hong Kong returns. Income taxes reflected in the accompanying

NOTE 12--STOCK OPTION PLAN
Under its Third Amended and Restated 1995 Stock Option Plan the Plan, the
Company has reserved 2,625,000 shares of its common stock for issuance upon
exercise of options granted under the Plan. In 1999, stockholders approved an
increase of 750,000 shares in the number of shares available for grant. Under
the Plan, employees including officers, non-employee directors and independent
consultants may be granted options to purchase shares of common stock. Prior to
the adoption of the Plan in 1995, options for 414,750 shares were granted at an
exercise price of $133 per share. The Company recorded deferred compensation
costs and a related increase in paid-in capital of $212,905 for the difference
between the grant price and the deemed fair market value of the common stock of
$185 per share at the date of grant. Such compensation costs are recognized on
a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the options, which is 25% per
year commencing twelve months after the grant date of such options. In 1997,
1998 and 1999, the fair value of each employee option grant was estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
assumptions used: risk-free rate of interest of 6%; dividend yield of 0%; and
expected lives of five years.
As of December 31, 1999, 64,374 shares were available for future grant.
Additional shares may become available to the extent that options presently
outstanding under the Plan terminate or expire unexercised.
