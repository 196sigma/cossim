ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
-           REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To Pierce Leahy Corp. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pierce Leahy
Corp. a Pennsylvania corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and
1997, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders'
equity deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1998. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Pierce Leahy Corp. and
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP Philadelphia, Pa.,

PIERCE LEAHY CORP.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1998
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
1.  BACKGROUND:
Pierce Leahy Corp., the Company, stores and services business records for
clients throughout the United States and Canada. The Company also sells storage
containers and provides records management consulting services, imaging
services, and marketing literature storage and fulfillment services.
On June 25, 1997, the Company effected a stock split, reclassified its Class A
and Class B Common stock to Common stock, authorized 10,000,000 shares of
undesignated Preferred stock and increased its authorized Common stock to
80,000,000 shares. All references in the accompanying financial statements to
the number of Common shares and per-share amounts have been retroactively
restated to reflect the stock split.
In July 1997, the Company completed an initial public offering of 5,664,017
shares of Common stock, raising net proceeds of $93,608. The proceeds of the
offering were used to redeem a portion of the Company 11 1/8% Senior
Subordinated Notes and to repay outstanding borrowings under the Company
credit facility see Note 6.
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Principles of Consolidation
- The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pierce Leahy
Corp., its 99%-owned subsidiary, Pierce Leahy Command Company, and its wholly-
owned subsidiaries, Archivex, Ltd., Monarch Box, Inc. and Advanced Box, Inc. All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The minority interest in Pierce Leahy Command Company is not material to the
consolidated financial statements.
Use of Estimates
- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Inventories
- Inventories, which consist primarily of storage containers, are stated at the
lower of cost first-in, first-out or market.
Property and Equipment
- Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using
straight-line and accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. This statement requires that certain
costs related to the development 
27
or purchase of internal-use software be capitalized and amortized over the
estimated useful life of the software, and also requires that costs related to
the preliminary project stage and post implementation/operations stage in an
internal-use computer software development project be charged to expense as
incurred. The Company capitalization policy was in accordance with the
requirements of SOP 98-1 throughout 1998, 1997 and 1996.
Goodwill
- Goodwill reflects the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets of
companies acquired in purchase transactions. Goodwill is amortized using the
straight-line method from the date of acquisition over the expected period to be
benefited, estimated at 30 years. The Company assesses the recoverability of
goodwill, as well as other long-lived assets, based upon expectations of future
undiscounted cash flows in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. At December 31, 1998, no
adjustment of the carrying values of long-lived assets was necessary.
Client Acquisition Costs
- The unreimbursed costs of moving the records of new clients into the Company
facilities and sales commissions related to new client contracts have been
capitalized and are included in intangible assets in the accompanying balance
sheets see Note 4. All such costs are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over six years, which represents the average initial contract term. The
Company assesses whether amortization using a six year average initial contract
term varies significantly from using a specific contract basis. Such difference
has not been material.
Deferred Rent
- Certain of the Company leases for warehouse space provide for scheduled rent
increases over the lease terms. The Company recognizes rent expense on a
straight-line basis over the lease terms, with the excess rent charged to
expense over the amount paid recorded as deferred rent in the accompanying
balance sheets.
Health Insurance Reserve
- The Company self-insures for benefit claims under a health insurance plan
provided to employees. The self-insurance was limited to $100 in claims per
insured individual per year for both 1998 and 1997, and a liability for claims
incurred but not reported is reflected in the accompanying balance sheets.
Specific stop-loss insurance coverage is maintained to cover claims in excess of
the coverage per insured individual per year.
Income Taxes
- Prior to July 1, 1997, the Company was an S Corporation for federal and state
income tax purposes and, accordingly, income and losses were passed through to
the shareholders and taxed at the individual level. On July 1, 1997, in
connection with the Company initial public offering, the Company terminated
its S Corporation election and currently provides for federal and state income
taxes.
The Company applies SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires
the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences, measured by enacted tax rates, attributable to temporary
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards, for years in which taxes are expected to be paid or recovered.
28
Revenue Recognition
- Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective service
is provided. Storage material sales are recognized when shipped to the
customer. Deferred revenues represent amounts invoiced for storage services in
advance of the rendering of the services. The costs of storage and service
revenues are not separately distinguishable, as the revenue producing activities
are interdependent and costs are not directly attributable or allocable in a
meaningful way to those activities.
Foreign Currency
- The balance sheets of Pierce Leahy Command Company and Archivex, Limited, the
Company Canadian subsidiaries, are translated into U.S. dollars using the rate
of exchange at period end. The statements of operations for the Canadian
subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rate
for the period. Net unrecognized exchange gains or losses resulting from the
translation of the balance sheets are accumulated and included as comprehensive
income on the statement of shareholders' equity deficit. Exchange gains and
losses are recognized during the period, including those related to the U.S.
dollar denominated 8 1/8% Senior Notes of Pierce Leahy Command Company due in
2008, and are included in the Company consolidated statements of operations.
Comprehensive Income
- In 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income.
SFAS No. 130 requires the reporting and disclosure of comprehensive income and
its components which encompasses net income and foreign currency translation
adjustments. The Company reports comprehensive income in the consolidated
statement of shareholders' equity deficit. The prior year financial statements
have been restated to conform to the reporting requirements of SFAS No. 130.
New Accounting Pronouncements
- In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133
establishes standards for reporting and classification of derivatives on the
balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value. Gains or losses
resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for
depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge
accounting. SFAS No. 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
1999. This pronouncement is not expected to have any impact on the Company
financial position or results of operations as the Company has not currently
entered into any such instruments or hedging activities.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
- 
For certain of the Company financial instruments, including accounts
receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, management believes that the
carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The
carrying amount and estimated fair value of the Company 11 1/8% Senior
Subordinated Notes at December 31, 1998 was $130,000 and $143,650, respectively.
The carrying amount and estimated fair value of the Company 9 1/8% Senior
Subordinated Notes at December 31, 1998 was $120,000 and $126,000, respectively.
The carrying amount and estimated fair value of the Company 8 1/8% Senior
Notes at December 31, 1998 was $134,537 and $133,864, respectively. All of the
Notes are publicly traded, and accordingly, the fair value of the Notes was
estimated based on the quoted market price offered for such securities.
Pro Forma Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share
- 
Prior to July 1, 1997, the Company was an S Corporation for federal and state
income tax purposes. The pro forma income tax provision for 1997 reflects taxes
that would have been recorded on the historical loss before income taxes, at an
effective rate of 39%, had the Company not been an S Corporation during such
29
period. The basic and diluted pro forma net loss per share is computed by
dividing pro forma net loss by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the period. 3.  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT:

11 1/8% SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE 2006
- 
In July 1996, the Company issued $200,000 of Senior Subordinated Notes in a
private offering that were later exchanged for registered notes with
substantially identical terms the 1996 Notes. The 1996 Notes are general
unsecured obligations of the Company, subordinated in right of payment to senior
indebtedness of the Company and senior in right of payment to any current or
future subordinated indebtedness. The 1996 Notes are guaranteed by the U.S.
subsidiaries of the Company and secured by a second lien on 65% of the stock of
the Company Canadian subsidiaries. The 1996 Notes mature on July 15, 2006, and
bear interest at 11 1/8% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on January 15
and July 15. The proceeds from the sale of the 1996 Notes were used to retire
certain existing indebtedness of the Company under its previous credit
facilities, to purchase certain properties from related party partnerships see
Note 12, to redeem stock from a shareholder see Note 8, to fund an
acquisition and for general corporate purposes. Upon completion of the Company
initial public offering of its Common stock in July 1997 see Note 1, the
Company exercised an option to redeem $70,000 principal amount of the 1996
Notes. The resulting $7,000 prepayment penalty along with the write-off of a
portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs of $3,050, net of an income
tax benefit of $4,014, was recorded as an extraordinary charge in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
31
9 1/8% SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE 2007
- 
In July 1997, the Company issued $120,000 of Senior Subordinated Notes the
1997 Notes in a public offering. The 1997 Notes are general unsecured
obligations of the Company, subordinated in right of payment to the senior
indebtedness of the Company and senior in right of payment to any current or
future subordinated indebtedness. The 1997 Notes are guaranteed by the U.S.
subsidiaries of the Company and secured by a third lien on 65% of the stock of
the Company Canadian subsidiaries. The 1997 Notes are equal in right of
payment with the 1996 Notes. The 1997 Notes mature on July 7, 2007, and bear
interest at 9 1/8% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and
July 15. The proceeds from the sale of the 1997 Notes were used to repay
outstanding borrowings under a previous credit facility and for general
corporate purposes.
8 1/8% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2008
- In April 1998, Pierce Leahy Command Company, the Company principal Canadian
subsidiary, issued $135,000 of Senior Notes in a private offering that were
later exchanged for registered notes with substantially identical terms the
1998 Notes. The 1998 Notes are general unsecured obligations of Pierce Leahy
Command Company ranking pari passu in right of payment to all existing and
future senior unsecured indebtedness of Command. The 1998 Notes are effectively
subordinated to secured indebtedness of Command to the extent of the assets
securing such indebtedness. The 1998 Notes are guaranteed on a senior
subordinated basis by the Company, which guarantee is equal in right of payment
with the 1996 and 1997 Notes. The 1998 Notes mature on May 15, 2008, and bear
interest at 8 1/8% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and
November 15. The proceeds from the sale of the 1998 Notes were used primarily to
finance the acquisition of Archivex Inc., to repay outstanding borrowings under
the credit facility and for general corporate purposes.
REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY
- In February 1998, the Company amended its credit facility to provide for a
revolving line of credit of U.S. $150 million in borrowings and CDN $40 million
in borrowings for Pierce Leahy Command Company. The credit facility is senior
to all subordinated indebtedness of the Company and is secured by substantially
all of the assets of the Company, and a first lien on 65% of the stock of the
Company Canadian subsidiaries. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at
prime plus an applicable margin, or at LIBOR plus an applicable margin, at the
option of the Company. In addition to interest and other customary fees, the
Company is obligated to remit a fee of 0375% per year on unused commitments,
payable quarterly. The aggregate available commitment under the credit facility
will be reduced on a quarterly basis beginning September 30, 2001. The credit
facility matures on June 30, 2004, unless previously terminated. The Company
available borrowing capacity under the credit facility is contingent upon the
Company meeting certain financial ratios and other criteria.
The weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings on the U.S. portion
of the revolver at December 31, 1998 was 76%. The highest amount outstanding
during the year ended December 31, 1998 was $125,500, the average amount
outstanding during the year was $79,150, and the weighted average interest rate
was 795%. The highest amount outstanding under the U.S. revolver during the
year ended December 31, 1997 was $117,763, the average amount outstanding during
the year was $69,338, and the weighted average interest rate was 785%.
There were no outstanding borrowings on the Canadian portion of the credit
facility at December 31, 1998. The highest amounts outstanding during the years
ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, were CDN $35,000 and $31,900, respectively.
The average amounts outstanding in 1998 and 1997, respectively, were CDN $8,750
and $17,100, while the weighted average interest rates were 851% and 612 respectively.
32
In February 1999, the Company amended the U.S. portion of the credit facility to
provide for borrowings of up to $175 million. All other material terms and
conditions remained the same.
MORTGAGE NOTES
- In connection with the purchase of real estate from related parties in 1996 see
Note 12, the Company assumed a mortgage of $1,114. The mortgage bears interest
at 105% and requires monthly principal and interest payments of $20 through
2002. The Company also assumed mortgage notes in connection with certain
acquisitions during 1998, 1997 and 1996 of $2,465, $2,000 and $2,630,
respectively. The notes bear interest at rates of approximately 8% and require
monthly principal and interest payments ranging from $12 to $22 through 2009.
SELLER NOTES
- In connection with certain acquisitions completed in 1998 and 1997, notes for
$3,175, and $1,652, respectively, were issued to the sellers. The notes bear
interest at rates ranging from 5% to 7% per year. The outstanding balances on
the notes as of December 31, 1998 mature through 1999.
Future scheduled principal payments on all of the Company long-term debt at
December 31, 1998 are as follows                         
1999                 $ 3,583 
2000                    933 
2001                   2,563 
2002                  21,013 
2003                  49,644 
2004 and thereafter          440,209 
$517,945 
Upon entering into prior credit facilities in 1993 and 1994, the Company issued
warrants to certain lenders to purchase common stock. Warrants to purchase
229,825 shares at $01 per share were issued in 1993 and 55,073 shares at $268
per share were issued in 1994. Management assigned an initial value of $338 to
the 1993 warrants and $87 to the 1994 warrants for financial reporting purposes.
The Company called the warrants in February 1996 at an amount which was
determined by a formula defined in the credit agreement. The change in value of
the redeemable warrants from the initial value has been accreted through a
charge to shareholder equity deficit in the accompanying financial
statements. The warrants were redeemed for $2,625 in 1996. There were no
warrants outstanding during 1997 or 1998.
Debt refinancings occurred in 1997 and 1996, resulting in the write-off of
previously deferred financing costs of $3,050 and $2,015, respectively, and
prepayment and other charges of $7,000 in 1997. Such write-offs and charges have
been recorded as extraordinary charges, net of tax, in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. No debt refinancings occurred in 1998.
The Company is in compliance with all financial and operating covenants required
under all indentures and under the Credit Facility.

Shares issued and outstanding December 31, 1997               -        16,477,728     In 1996, the Company redeemed 105,910 shares of Common stock for $1,450 and
canceled these shares.
Certain shareholders of the Company entered into a voting trust agreement on
June 24, 1997. The shares held in trust represent 485% of the outstanding
Common stock at December 31, 1998. The trustees of the voting trust include the
President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Chairman of the
Board of Directors. Each of the trustees has shared power to vote the shares
held in the voting trust. The beneficial owners of interests in the voting
trust have the right to dispose of the shares to which they have beneficial
interests.

9. STOCK OPTIONS:
In September 1994, the Company established a non-qualified stock option plan
which provides for the granting of options to key employees to purchase an
aggregate of 1,208,433 shares of Common stock. The shares available for grant
were increased by 284,898 in December 1996. Option grants have an exercise price
equal to the fair market value of the Common stock on the date of grant. Before
the Company consummated its initial public offering of Common stock in July 1997
see Note 1, the fair market value of the options was determined based upon a
formula, as defined in the option plan. The options granted vest in five equal
annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant,
except as discussed below.
Upon the consummation of the Company initial public offering of Common stock
in July 1997, options granted during 1997 became fully vested and exercisable as
provided for under the plan. The Company recorded a non-recurring, non-cash
compensation charge of approximately $1,752 relating to those options,
representing the difference between the exercise price and the deemed value for
accounting purposes.
In April 1997, the Company adopted its 1997 Stock Option Plan the 1997 Plan
which provides for the granting of stock options to purchase up to 1,500,000
shares of Common stock to employees, officers, directors, consultants and
advisors of the Company. The 1997 Plan is administered by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors the Committee. Grants may consist of
incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. The option price of any
incentive stock option granted will not be less than the fair value of the
underlying shares of Common stock on the date of grant. The option price of a
non-qualified stock option will be determined by the Committee and may be
greater than, equal to or less than the fair market value of the underlying
shares of Common stock on the date of grant. The term of each option will be
determined by the Committee, provided that the exercise period may not exceed 10
years from the date of grant. The options granted may be subject to vesting and
other conditions. In the event of a change in control as defined in the 1997
Plan, all outstanding options will become fully exercisable.
Information related to all of the Company existing stock option plans is as

At December 31, 1998, 647,333 options to purchase shares of Common stock are
fully vested and exercisable.  Subsequent to December 31, 1998, the Company
issued 151,000 options to employees at an exercise price of $2550 per share.
The Company accounts for its option plans under APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, under which no compensation cost has been
recognized. In 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123 establishes a fair
value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation plans. This
statement also applies to transactions in which an entity issues its equity
instruments to acquire goods or services from non                    36
employees. SFAS No. 123 requires that an employer financial statements include
certain disclosures about stock-based employee compensation arrangements
regardless of the method used to account for the plan.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions used for the
grants in 1998, 1997 and 1996:
1998      1997     1996
Risk free interest rates                   55%      64%      56%

Expected dividend yields                   N/A      N/A      N/A
Expected volatility                      45%      20%      15 The approximate fair value of each option granted in 1998, 1997 and 1996 is
$1136, $208 and $206, respectively, as determined under the provisions of
SFAS No. 123. The following pro forma results would have been reported had
compensation cost been recorded for the fair value of the options granted:
1998      1997      1996
Net loss applicable to Common shareholders, as reported         $10,990   $15,197    $1,053
Net loss applicable to Common shareholders, pro forma     
for compensation cost and income taxes in 1997 Note 1       $11,468   $ 9,681    $1,311
Net loss per share applicable to Common shareholders, pro forma
for compensation cost and income taxes in 1997 Note 1       $ 068   $ 072       The SFAS No. 123 method of accounting is applied only to options granted on or
after January 1, 1995. The resulting pro forma compensation cost may not be
representative of the amount to be expected in future years due to the vesting
schedule of the options.
10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:
Operating Leases
- At December 31, 1998, the Company was obligated under non-cancelable operating
leases, including the related-party leases discussed below, for warehouse space,
office equipment and transportation equipment. These leases expire at various
times through 2024 and require minimum rentals, subject to escalation, as
follows                        
1999                  $   38,320            
2000                     37,201          
2001                     34,885          
2002                     32,094          
2003                     28,283          
2004 and thereafter              97,495          
$  268,278          
Rent expense for all leases was approximately $31,077, $21,657, and $17,008 for
the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Some of the
leases for warehouse space provide for purchase options on the facilities at
certain dates.
The Company leases office and warehouse space at prices which, in the opinion of
management, approximate market rates from entities which are owned by certain
shareholders, officers and employees of the Company. Rent expense on these
leases was approximately $961, $845, and $9,019 for the years ended December 31,
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. A significant portion of the related party
rent expense 
37
was reduced through the purchase of certain real estate and the buy-out of
certain lease interests in July 1996 see Note 12.
Other Matters
- The Company is party to various claims arising in the ordinary course of
business. Although the ultimate outcome of these matters is presently not
determinable, management, after consultation with legal counsel, does not
believe that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect
on the Company consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In June 1997, the Company entered into a tax indemnification agreement with its
then current shareholders which provides for: i the distribution to such
shareholders of cash equal to the product of the Company taxable income for
the period from January 1, 1997 until July 1, 1997 and the sum of the highest
effective federal and state income tax rate applicable to any current
shareholder, less any prior distributions to such shareholders to pay taxes for
such period, and ii an indemnification of such shareholders for any losses or
liabilities with respect to any additional taxes including interest, penalties
and legal fees resulting from the Company operations during the period in
which it was a Subchapter S Corporation.
11. EARNINGS PER SHARE:
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 128,
Earnings per Share. SFAS No. 128 requires dual presentation of basic and
diluted earnings per share. According to SFAS No. 128, basic earnings per
share, which replaces primary earnings per share, is calculated by dividing net
income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for
the period. Diluted earnings per share, which replaces fully diluted earnings
per share, reflects the potential dilution from the exercise or conversion of
securities into Common stock, such as stock options and warrants. The Company
adopted SFAS No. 128 in 1997.
In 1998 and 1997 there were no dilutive effects of stock options or warrants as
the Company had a loss before extraordinary item. In 1996, the weighted average
of shares outstanding was 10,546,871. The dilutive effects of the weighted
average number of stock options and warrants outstanding was 84,059 shares.
12. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:
In August 1996, the Company purchased certain real estate previously leased and
other assets from two partnerships, whose partners were shareholders of the
Company. The payment for the purchased real estate and other assets was $11,018
plus the assumption of a $1,114 mortgage. Since the transaction was with
related parties, the real estate was recorded at its depreciated cost. As a
result, the Company charged the elimination of the deferred rent liability on
the leases and the difference between the purchase price and the depreciated
cost, which together totaled $4,132, to shareholders' equity deficit as a
deemed distribution. In addition, the Company bought out certain lease
commitments from a related party partnership for $2,764. This lease buy-out was
recorded as a non-recurring charge in the 1996 consolidated statement of
operations.
The Company had an agreement with a shareholder of the Company that required
payments of $60 per year for five years upon the death of the shareholder. The
present value of this benefit was recorded as a liability by the Company. In
July 1996, the Company decided to make monthly pension payments to the
shareholder and terminated the previous agreement. The pension payments are $8
per month until the later of the death of the shareholder or his spouse. The
$490 difference between the present value of this benefit and the liability
previously reported was recorded as a non-recurring charge in the 1996
consolidated statement of operations.
38
The Company paid financial advisory fees to an investment banking firm of which
a director of the Company was a managing director. The fees were approximately
$62 in 1997 and $800 in 1996, respectively. In addition, the investment banking
firm received $1,800 from the underwriters on the 1997 Notes and initial public
offering and $310 from the placement agent on the 1998 Notes.
The Company paid real estate advisory fees to a firm of which a director of the
Company is the owner. The fees were approximately $8 in 1998 and $88 in 1997.
There were no fees paid to the firm in 1996.
13. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:
The Company maintains a discretionary profit sharing and a 401k plan for
substantially all full-time employees over the age of 20 1/2 and with more than
1,000 hours of service. Participants in the 401k plan may elect to defer a
specified percentage of their compensation on a pretax basis. The Company is
required to make matching contributions equal to 25% of the employee
contribution up to a maximum of 2% of the employee annual compensation.
Participants become vested in the Company matching contribution over three to
seven years. The expense relating to these plans was $1,209, $892 and $1,122
for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
14. ACQUISITIONS:
In 1996, the Company completed 12 acquisitions for an aggregate cash purchase
price of $62,165 of which $14,000 was for one transaction in May 1996 and
$13,500 was for another transaction in October 1996; all others were
individually less than $8,000.
In 1997, the Company completed 17 acquisitions, of which 15 were recorded under
the purchase method of accounting while the other two acquisitions were
accounted for as pooling of interests. The 15 acquisitions accounted for under
the purchase method had an aggregate purchase price of $109,098, consisting
primarily of $102,068 in net cash, 163,266 shares of Common stock with a deemed
value of $4,500 and $1,652 in Seller notes. For purposes of computing the
purchase price for accounting purposes, the value of the shares issued is
determined using a discount of 10% from the market value at the day of issuance
due to certain restrictions on the sale and transferability of shares issued.
The most significant of these acquisitions was one acquisition for $9,084 in
January 1997 and another for $62,000 in April 1997; all others were individually
less than $8,000.
During 1997, the Company also completed two mergers with records management
businesses by exchanging an aggregate of 165,355 shares of Common stock for the
stock of these entities. These mergers constituted tax free reorganizations and
have been accounted for as pooling of interests under Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 16. Prior periods have not been restated for the acquisitions
due to the immateriality of the transactions, and the book value of net assets
acquired of $407 has been recorded as additional paid-in capital. The results
of operations for each acquisition have been included in the consolidated
results of the Company from their respective acquisition dates.
In 1998, the Company completed 16 acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price
of $204,070, consisting primarily of $186,486 in net cash, 548,262 shares of
Common Stock with a deemed value of $14,409 and $3,175 in Seller notes. The most
significant of these acquisitions was one transaction for $59,000 in April 1998,
another for $30,000 in May 1998 and a third for $52,000 in July 1998, all others
were individually less than $15,000. All of the acquisitions in 1998 were
recorded under the purchase method of accounting.
In addition to these payments, the acquisitions in 1998, 1997, and 1996 provided
for non-compete obligations of $40, $60, and $400, respectively, payable over
one year. The non-compete obligations at December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 was
$166, $347 and $783, respectively. The results of operations for each of these
acquisitions have been included in the consolidated results of the Company from
their respective acquisition dates. The excess of the fair value of the assets
and liabilities acquired has been 
39
allocated to goodwill $178,049 in 1998, $91,047, in 1997 and $43,062 in 1996
and is being amortized over the estimated benefit period of 30 years.
Subsequent to December 31, 1998, the Company completed three acquisitions of
records management businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
$42,146, consisting of $23,402 in net cash and $18,744 in Seller notes. Certain
purchase agreements contain purchase price adjustments that could affect the net
cash paid for such acquisitions. The acquisitions were accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting. The $36,264 excess of the purchase price over
the underlying fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired has been
allocated to goodwill. The most significant of these acquisitions was
Datavault, Limited, a U.K. based records management company with operations in
seven markets throughout England and Scotland. This acquisition was primarily
financed by borrowings under the Company recently amended credit facility see
Note 6.
A summary of the net cash paid for the purchase price of the completed
acquisitions is as follows                                    Year Ended December 31,
