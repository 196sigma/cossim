REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To BSQUARE Corporation     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BSQUARE
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related
consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, shareholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1999. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above,
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BSQUARE
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.                       ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
BSQUARE Corporation, a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries
collectively the Company provides a variety of software products and services
that facilitate the integration of the Microsoft Windows based operating systems
with a wide variety of intelligent computing devices. The Company works with
semiconductor vendors and original equipment manufacturers to provide software
products and engineering services for the development of intelligent computing
devices.
The Company helps enable the rapid and low-cost deployment of
intelligent computing devices by providing a variety of software products and
services for the development, integration and deployment of Windows-based
operating systems with industry-specific applications. The Company also develops
software applications that are licensed to end users to provide intelligent
computing devices with additional functionality. The Company markets and
supports its products and provides services on a worldwide basis through a
direct sales force augmented by distributors.
CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Company operates in the software industry, and accordingly, can be
affected by a variety of factors. For example, management of the Company
believes that any of the following factors could have a significant negative
effect on the Company future financial position, results of operations and
cash flows: unanticipated fluctuations in quarterly operating results; failure
of the market for Windows CE operating system to develop fully; failure of the
market for intelligent computing devices to develop fully; adverse changes in
the Company relationship with Microsoft; failure to secure contracts with
market-leading original equipment manufacturers; intense competition; failure to
attract and retain key personnel; failure to protect intellectual property;
risks associated with international operations; inability to manage growth; and
litigation or other claims against the Company.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. Accounts denominated in foreign currencies
have been re-measured into the functional currency, using the U.S. dollar as the
functional currency.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 128, Computation of Earnings Per Share, basic earnings per share is
computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders net income
less accretion of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Dilutive earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding
during the                    38
39
period. Common equivalent shares consist of the shares of common stock issuable
upon the conversion of the mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock
using the if-converted method and shares issuable upon the exercise of stock
options and warrants using the treasury stock method; common equivalent shares
are excluded from the calculation if their effect is antidilutive. The Company
has not had any issuances or grants for nominal consideration as defined under
Staff Accounting Bulletin 98.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents, include demand deposits, money market
accounts and all highly liquid debt instruments with an original maturity date
of three months or less.
SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
The Company short-term investments consist primarily of
investment-grade marketable securities, which are classified as held to maturity
and recorded at amortized cost. Due to the short-term nature of these
investments, changes in market interest rates would not have a significant
impact on the fair value of these securities that are carried at amortized cost,
which approximates fair value.
At December 31, 1999 and 1998, all short-term investments had a
contractual maturity of two years or less.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
The Company has the following financial instruments: cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
accrued liabilities, bank lines of credit and standby letters of credit. The
carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value
based on the liquidity of these financial instruments or based on their short
term nature. The carrying value of bank lines of credit, and standby letters of
credit approximates fair value based on the market interest rates available to
the Company for debt of similar risk and maturities.
The Company performs initial and ongoing evaluations of its customers'
financial position, and generally extends credit on open account, requiring
collateral as deemed necessary. The Company maintains allowances for potential
credit losses.
FURNITURE, EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS
Furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives, as follows: office furniture and equipment four years; computer equipment -- three years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life.
Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. When properties are retired or
otherwise disposed, gains or losses are reflected in the income statement. When
facts and circumstances indicate that the cost of long-lived assets may be
impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying
value of the asset to projected future cash flows. Upon indication that the
carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, the Company would
recognize an impairment loss by a charge against current operations.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Under the criteria set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold,
Leased, or Otherwise Marketed, capitalization of software development costs
begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility of the product, which
the Company has defined as the completion of beta testing of a working product.
The establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of the
recoverability of these costs require considerable judgment by management with
respect to certain external factors, including, but not limited to, anticipated
future gross product revenue estimated economic life and changes in software and
hardware technology. Amounts that could have been capitalized under this
statement after                    39
40
consideration of the above factors were immaterial and, therefore, no software
development costs have been capitalized by the Company to date.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
INCOME TAXES
The Company computes income taxes using the asset and liability method,
under which deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences
between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company assets
and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred
tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is the local currency.
Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange
rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense accounts at the
average exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are
recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity. The net gains and
losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in the
consolidated statements of income in the period incurred and were not
significant for any of the periods presented.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company revenue recognition policy is in compliance with the
provisions of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Statement
of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. Service revenue is derived
from software porting and development contracts. Product revenue consists of
licensing fees from software application products and operating system and
software development tool products. The Company customers consist of software
companies, original equipment manufacturers, distributors and end users.
The Company revenue is recognized as follows     Time and Material Consulting Contracts. The Company recognizes revenue
as services are rendered.
Fixed-Price Consulting Contracts. Service revenue from fixed-price
contracts is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the
cost incurred to date to the estimated total cost for the contract. This method
is used as management considers expended costs to be the best available measure
of contract performance. Contract costs include all direct labor, material and
any other costs related to contract performance. Selling, general and
administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred. Provisions for
estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such
losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated
profitability may result in revisions in the estimate of total costs. Any
required adjustments due to these changes are recognized in the period in which
such revisions are determined.
Product Revenue. Product revenue consists principally of fees from the
licensing and sale of software products. Product licensing fees, including
advanced production royalty payments, are generally recognized when a customer
license agreement has been executed, the software has been shipped, remaining
obligations are insignificant and collection of the resulting account receivable
is probable. The Company recognizes license royalty income as it is reported by
the reseller when it ships its product to distributors.
Deferred revenue consists of deposits received from customers and
unamortized service contract revenue.                    40

RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.
