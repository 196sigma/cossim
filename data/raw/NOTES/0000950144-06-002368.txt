The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these
consolidated statements. Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of National HealthCare
Corporation and its subsidiaries NHC or the Company. All material intercompany
balances, profits, and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation, and
minority interests are reflected in consolidation. Investments in entities in which
we lack control but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating
and financial policies are accounted for on the equity method. Investments in
entities in which we lack the ability to exercise significant influence are included
in the consolidated financial statements at the lower of the cost or fair value of our
investment. Generally, we operate, manage or provide services to long-term health care
centers and associated assisted living centers, retirement centers and home health
care programs located in Southeastern, Midwestern and Western states in the United
States. The long-term health care environment has continually undergone changes with
regard to Federal and state reimbursement programs and other payor sources, compliance
regulations, competition among other health care providers and patient care litigation
issues. We continually monitor these industry developments as well as other factors
that affect our business.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
Net Patient Revenues Gross patient revenues are recorded on an accrual basis based on services
rendered at amounts equal to our established rates. Approximately 72% of our net
patient revenues in 2005, and 2004 and 71% in 2003 are from participation in Medicare
and Medicaid programs. Our patient revenues are derived primarily from skilled, intermediate and
rehabilitative nursing services offered in long-term health care centers or in a
patients home. In some locations, we offer associated retirement center services
and/or assisted living center services. Our goal is to offer a continuum of care,
with patients passing from a retirement center or home care to assisted living or
long-term nursing center care as their needs change. We receive payments from the Medicare program under a prospective payment system
PPS. Under this PPS, for long-term care services, Medicare pays a fixed fee per
Medicare patient per day, based on the acuity level of the patient, to cover all
post-hospital extended care routine service costs, ancillary costs and capital related
costs. Amounts received from Medicaid programs are generally based on fixed rates
subject to program cost ceilings. For homecare services, Medicare pays based on the acuity level of the patient and
based on episodes of care. An episode of care is defined as a length of care up to 60
days with multiple continuous episodes allowed. The services covered by the episode
payment include all disciplines of care, in addition to medical supplies, within the
scope of the home health benefit. We are allowed to make a request for anticipated
payment at the start of care equal to 60% of the expected payment for the initial
episode. The remaining balance due is paid following the submission of the final
claim at the end of the episode. Revenues are recognized when services are provided
based on the number of days of service rendered in the episode. Deferred revenue is
recorded for payments received for which the related services have not yet been
provided. 48 Table of Contents Allowances for contractual adjustments are recorded for the differences between
our established rates and amounts paid by the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other
third party payors. Contractual adjustments are deducted from gross patient revenues
to determine net patient revenues. All amounts earned under the Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs
are subject to review by the payors. In the opinion of management, adequate provision
and reserves have been made for any adjustments that may result from such reviews,
including reviews related to the transition of payments to the PPS amounts. Any
differences between estimated settlements and final determinations are reflected in
operations in the year finalized. NHC recorded $169,000 in 2005, $24,225,000 in 2004,
and $2,683,000 in 2003 of net favorable settlements from Medicare and Medicaid for
periods prior to the beginning of fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. With respect to our long-term health care centers, for the cost report years 1997
and 1998 which were subject to a retrospective reimbursement methodology, we
submitted various requests for exceptions to Medicare routine cost limitations for
reimbursement. During 2001, we received preliminary approval on substantially all of
our exception requests, which approvals total approximately $14,186,000. We have in
addition made provisions of approximately $12,761,000 for various Medicare and
Medicaid issues for current and prior years. We recognize revenues associated with
the approved exception requests and provisions when the approvals are assured and the
results of final cost report audits are known. These approvals and audit results are
subject to further audit and review by the fiscal intermediaries for a three-year
period. As such, the approved requests and cost report provisions have been included
in amounts due to third party payors, which are payables to Medicare and Medicaid
intermediaries, in the consolidated balance sheets. The three-year review period
expired in 2004 for approximately $22,820,000 of routine cost limit exceptions and
provisions. Therefore, these exceptions and provisions have been eliminated from the
amounts due to third party payors in the consolidated balance sheets, and have been
recorded as revenues in 2004. The amounts recorded during 2005 and 2003 were not
significant.
Other Revenues As discussed in Note 5, other revenues include revenues from the provision of
insurance, management and accounting services to other long-term care providers,
guarantee fees, advisory fees from National Health Investors, Inc. NHI and
National Health Realty, Inc. NHR, dividends and other realized gains on marketable
securities, equity in earnings of unconsolidated investments, interest income, rental
income, loss on disposal of assets and other income. Our insurance revenues are
generally paid in advance and then amortized into income as earned over the related
policy period. We charge for management and accounting services based on a percentage
of net revenues or based on a fixed fee per bed of the long-term care center under
contract. Advisory fees are based on our contractual agreements with NHR and, through
October31, 2004, NHI, and are discussed in Notes 2 and 3. We generally record other
revenues on the accrual basis based on the terms of our contractual arrangements.
However, with respect to management and accounting services revenue and interest
income from certain long-term care providers, including National Health Corporation
National and NHI, as discussed in Note 5, where collectibility is uncertain or
subject to subordination to other expenditures of the long-term care provider, we
recognize the revenues and interest income when the amounts are collected.
Provision for Doubtful Accounts The Companys allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated using current agings
of accounts receivable, historical collections data and other factors. Management
reviews these factors and determines the estimated provision for doubtful accounts.
Historical bad debts have generally resulted from uncollectible private balances, some
uncollectible coinsurance and deductibles and other factors. Receivables that are
deemed to be uncollectible are written off. The allowance for doubtful accounts
balance is assessed on a quarterly basis, with changes in estimated losses being
recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the period identified. The Company includes provisions for doubtful accounts in operating expenses in
its consolidated statements of operations. The provisions for doubtful accounts were
$2,641,000, $2,175,000, and $55,000 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 49 Table of Contents Property and Equipment We use the straight-line method of depreciation over the expected useful lives of
property and equipment estimated as follows: buildings and improvements, 20-40years
and equipment and furniture, 3-15years. The provision for depreciation includes the
amortization of properties under capital leases. Leasehold improvements attached to properties owned by NHI and NHR are
depreciated over periods that do not exceed the non-cancelable respective lease terms
using the straight-line method. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged against income as incurred.
Betterments are capitalized. We remove the costs and related allowances from the
accounts for properties sold or retired, and any resulting gains or losses are
included in income. We include interest costs incurred during construction periods in
the cost of buildings $31,000 in 2005, $240,000 in 2004, and $162,000 in 2003. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144, we
evaluate the recoverability of the carrying values of our properties on a property by
property basis. We review our properties for recoverability when events or
circumstances, including significant physical changes in the property, significant
adverse changes in general economic conditions, and significant deteriorations of the
underlying cash flows of the property, indicate that the carrying amount of the
property may not be recoverable. The need to recognize an impairment is based on
estimated future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying value of that
property. If recognition of an impairment is necessary, it is measured as the amount
by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds the estimated fair value of the
property.
Mortgage and Other Notes Receivable In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No114,
Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan An Amendment of FASB Statements
No5 and 15 SFAS 114, NHC evaluates the carrying values of its mortgage and
other notes receivable on an instrument by instrument basis. On a quarterly basis,
NHC reviews its notes receivable for recoverability when events or circumstances,
including the non-receipt of principal and interest payments, significant
deteriorations of the financial condition of the borrower and significant adverse
changes in general economic conditions, indicate that the carrying amount of the note
receivable may not be recoverable. If necessary, an impairment is measured as the
amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the discounted cash flows expected to be
received under the note receivable or, if foreclosure is probable, the fair value of
the collateral securing the note receivable.
Investments in Marketable Securities Our investments in marketable securities include available for sale securities,
which are recorded at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale
securities are recorded in stockholders equity in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities SFAS 115.
Goodwill The Company accounts for goodwill under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142. Under the
provisions of the statement, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment tests based on their estimated
fair value. Unamortized goodwill is continually reviewed for impairment in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS 142. 50 Table of Contents Other Assets Deferred financing costs are amortized principally by the effective interest
method over the terms of the related debt obligations.
Income Taxes We utilize Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No109, Accounting for
Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting
and reporting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based upon differences between financial reporting and tax
bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax laws that will
be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. See Note 11 for further
discussion of our accounting for income taxes.
Concentration of Credit Risks Our credit risks primarily relate to cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash
held by trustees, accounts receivable, marketable securities and notes receivable.
Cash and cash equivalents are primarily held in bank accounts and overnight
investments. Restricted cash is primarily invested in commercial paper and
certificates of deposit with financial institutions and other interest bearing
accounts. Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from patients funded
approximately 87% through Medicare, Medicaid, and other contractual programs and
approximately 13% through private payors and from other health care companies for
management, accounting and other services. We perform continual credit evaluations of
our clients and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts on these accounts
receivable. Marketable securities are held primarily in accounts with brokerage
institutions. Notes receivable relate primarily to secured loans with health care
facilities recorded as notes receivable in the consolidated balance sheets as
discussed in Note 9. We also have notes receivable from National and the National
Health Corporation Leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan ESOP as discussed in
Note 4. Our financial instruments, principally our notes receivable, are subject to the
possibility of loss of the carrying values as a result of either the failure of other
parties to perform according to their contractual obligations or changes in market
prices which may make the instruments less valuable. We obtain various collateral and
other protective rights, and continually monitor these rights in order to reduce such
possibilities of loss. We evaluate the need to provide reserves for potential losses
on our financial instruments based on managements periodic review of the portfolio on
an instrument by instrument basis. See Notes 4 and 9 for additional information on
the notes receivable.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
less than three months.
Restricted Cash Restricted cash primarily represents cash that is held by trustees and cash that
is held for the purpose of our workers compensation insurance, professional
liability insurance, and a loan repurchase obligation.
Inventories Inventories consist generally of food and supplies and are valued at the lower of
cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out FIFObasis.
Other Current Liabilities Other current liabilities primarily represent accruals for current federal and
state income taxes, real estate taxes, debt service rent and other current
liabilities. 51 Table of Contents Accrued Risk Reserves We are principally self-insured for risks related to employee health insurance,
workers compensation and professional and general liability claims. Accrued risk
reserves primarily represent the accrual for self-insured risks associated with
employee health insurance, workers compensation and professional and general
liability claims. The accrued risk reserves include a liability for reported claims
and estimates for incurred but unreported claims. Our policy with respect to a
significant portion of our workers compensation and professional and general
liability claims is to use an actuary to support the estimates recorded for incurred
but unreported claims. Our health insurance reserve is based on our known claims
incurred and an estimate of incurred but unreported claims determined by our analysis
of historical claims paid. We reassess our accrued risk reserves on a quarterly
basis, with changes in estimated losses being recorded in the consolidated statements
of income in the period identified.
Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation arrangements under the provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
APB 25 and related interpretations. Had compensation cost for our stock option plans been determined based on the
fair value at the grant date of awards consistent with the provisions of SFAS 123, our
net income and earnings per share would have been as follows

See Note 12 for additional disclosures about NHCs stock option plan. 52 Table of Contents Deferred Lease Credit Deferred lease credits include amounts being amortized to properly reflect
expenses on a straight line basis under the terms of our existing lease agreements.
Other Noncurrent Liabilities Other noncurrent liabilities include reserves related to various income tax and
other contingencies. With respect to guarantee obligations in place prior to January1, 2003, we
account for our obligations under guarantee agreements in accordance with the
provisions of Statement of Accounting Standards No5, Accounting for Contingencies
SFAS 5. For guarantee obligations assumed subsequent to January1, 2003,
consistent with the provisions of Interpretation No45, Guarantors Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness
of Others FIN 45, at the inception of a guarantee agreement, we recognize a
liability for the estimated fair value of the obligation assumed. We account for our contingent liabilities for income tax matters in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS 5. Contingent liabilities for income tax matters include
amounts for income taxes and interest thereon and are the result of the potential
alternative interpretations of tax laws and the judgmental nature of the timing of
recognition of taxable income.
Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue includes the deferred gain on the sale of assets to National as
discussed in Note 4, certain amounts related to episodic payments received by our
home health care providers in advance of providing services as discussed in Note 1
and entrance fees that have been and are currently being received upon reservation and
occupancy of retirement center units for a continuing care retirement community we
own. In accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Audit
and Accounting Guide, Health Care Organizations, the entrance fees have been
recorded as deferred revenue. The refundable portion 90% of the entrance fees is
being recognized over the life of the facility while the non-refundable portion 10%
is being recognized over the remaining life expectancies of the residents.
Comprehensive Income Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income requires that changes in the amounts of certain items, including gains and
losses on certain securities, be shown in the consolidated financial statements as
comprehensive income. We report our comprehensive income in the consolidated
statements of stockholders equity.
Segment Disclosures Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No131, Disclosures About Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information establishes standards for the way that
public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual and
interim financial reports issued to stockholders. Management believes that
substantially all of our operations are part of the long-term health care industry
segment. Our operations outside of the long-term health care industry segment are not
material. See Note 5 for a detail of other revenues provided within the long-term
health care industry segment. Information about the costs and expenses associated
with each of the components of other revenues is not separately identifiable. 53 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements On December16, 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No153, Exchanges of
Nonmonetary Assets An Amendment of APB Opinion No29. Statement 153 amends APB
Opinion No29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, that was issued in 1973. The
amendments made by Statement 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of
nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged.
Further, the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of
similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of
nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. Previously, Opinion 29
required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar
productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset
should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished. The provisions in
Statement 153 are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal
periods beginning after June15, 2005, and as such, the Company is unable to assess
the impact on the financial statements. Early application is permitted and companies
must apply the standard prospectively. The Company has adopted Statement 153
effective July1, 2005. The future effect of Statement 153 on the Companys financial
statements will depend on whether the Company enters into certain non-monetary
transactions. The Company does not expect the adoption of Statement 153 to have a
significant impact on its financial statements. In December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment, which
revises SFAS No123 and supersedes APB Opinion No25. This statement focuses
primarily on accounting for transactions in which a company obtains employee services
in share-based payment transactions, including employee stock purchase plans under
certain conditions, but does not change the accounting guidance for share-based
payment transactions with parties other than employees. This statement will require
all share-based payment to employees to be recognized in the income statement based on
their fair values. Pro form disclosure is no longer an alternative. This statement
will be effective for the Company beginning January1, 2006. SFAS No123R permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two
methods   
A modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized
beginning with the effective date abased on the requirements of SFAS 123R for
all share-based payments granted after the effective date and bbased on the
requirements of SFAS No123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the
effective date of SFAS No123R that remain unvested on the effective date.   
A modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the
modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to
restate, based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No123 for
purposes of pro forma disclosures, either aall prior periods presented or b
prior interim periods of the year of adoption. The Company plans to adopt SFAS No123R using the modified prospective method. In May2005, the FASB issued FASB Statement No154, Accounting for Changes and Error
Corrections. This new standard replaces APB Opinion No20, Accounting Changes and FASB
Statement No3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. Statement
154 requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with
all prior period financial statements presented on the new accounting principle, unless it
is impracticable to do so. Statement 154 also provides that 1a change in method of
depreciating or amortizing a long-lived nonfinancial asset be accounted for as a change in
estimate prospectivelythat was effected by a change in accounting principle, and 2
correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a
restatement. The new standard is effective for accounting changes and correction of
errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. The Company does not expect
the adoption of this pronouncement to have a significant impact on the Companys financial
statements. Note 2 Relationship with National Health Realty, Inc. In 1997, we formed NHR as a wholly-owned subsidiary. We then transferred to NHR
certain healthcare facilities then owned by NHC and distributed the shares of NHR to NHCs
shareholders. The distribution had the effect of separating NHC and NHR into two
independent public companies. As a result of the distribution, all of the outstanding
shares of NHR were distributed to the then NHC investors. NHR is listed on the American
Stock Exchange. 54 Table of Contents Leases Effective August1, 2005, we elected to exercise our option to extend the term of our
leases of properties from National Health Realty, Inc. NHR for two additional five year
terms until December31, 2017. The leases are for the real estate of ten long-term care
centers, three assisted living centers and one retirement center. The currently running
initial term of the leases expires on December31, 2007. The leases were further amended to
grant us an option to renew the leases at fair market value for a second extended term of
ten years until December31, 2027, assuming no defaults. We account for the leases as
operating leases. Under the terms of the master lease, we continue to guarantee to NHR the lease payments
of six Florida long-term care facilities and three assisted living centers, as discussed
below. This requirement is unchanged from our original lease as amended. The lease payments for the extended ten-year term of the leases that begin on January
1, 2008 are the same lease payments that were required in the initial term of the lease,
including an annual inflator for percentage rent as described below. The lease payments for
the second extended ten-year term that begins on January1, 2018, if renewed, will be at
fair market value as determined at the time of the lease renewal. During the remaining initial term and the extended renewal term, we are obligated to
pay NHR annual base rent on all 23 of the facilities of $15,960,000. In addition to base
rent, in each quarter of each year after 1999, we are obligated to pay percentage rent to
NHR equal to 3% of the amount by which gross revenues of each NHR leased health care
facility in such later quarter exceed the gross revenues of such health care facility in the
applicable quarter of 1999. Percentage rent for 2005, 2004 and 2003, was approximately
$1,363,000, $1,295,000, and $1,128,000, respectively. Each lease with NHR is a triple net
lease under which we are responsible for paying all taxes, utilities, insurance premium
costs, repairs and other charges relating to the operation of the facilities. We are
obligated at our expense to maintain adequate insurance on the facilities assets. On October1, 2000, we terminated our individual leases on nine Florida long term care
facilities. However, we remain obligated under our master lease agreement to make the lease
payments to NHR on the nine Florida long term care facilities. Also effective October1,
2000, the facilities were leased by NHR under a five year term to nine separate limited
liability corporations, none of which we own or control. The leases have currently been
extended through December31, 2010. Lease payments to NHR from the new lessees offset our
lease obligations pursuant to the master operating lease. Since October1, 2000, the nine
separate limited liability corporations have made all required lease payments to NHR, and we
have not been required to make any lease payments with respect to those nine properties. We have a right of first refusal with NHR to purchase any of the properties transferred
from us should NHR receive an offer from an unrelated party during the term of the lease or
up to 180days after termination of the related lease. At December31, 2005, the approximate future minimum base rent commitments to be paid
by us on non-cancelable operating leases are as follows

The leases have also been amended to provide that if we pay for the construction of a
bed addition, then the existing annual rent for that center will be increased by 75% of the
cost paid by us for the construction of the addition. Revenues produced within the addition
shall be excluded from any percentage rent calculation. At such time as we are 55 Table of Contents no longer a
tenant by virtue of lease terminations then NHR shall purchase the additional beds paid for
by us but un-reimbursed by NHR for the lesser of 1the appraised value of the addition or
2the construction cost incurred by us plus 50% of any appraised value increase over cost.
In addition, we agree at NHRs request to finance NHRs purchase of the addition with a
floating rate interest only note at the prime rate of interest for a period of up to two
years. We have submitted a listing of certain NHR owned properties expected to be expanded
by us for which the construction cost is expected to total approximately $26,225,000.
Advisory Agreement We have entered into an Advisory Agreement with NHR whereby services related to
investment activities and day-to-day management and operations are provided to NHR by NHC as
Advisor. The Advisor is subject to the supervision of and policies established by NHRs
Board of Directors. The Advisory Agreement expired December31, 2003 and thereafter is
renewed from year to year unless earlier terminated. Either party may terminate the
Advisory Agreement at any time on 90days written notice. The Advisory Agreement may be
terminated for cause at any time. On August1, 2005, concurrent with the lease extensions described above, the Advisory
Agreement was amended to provide that beginning for the year 2005 for our services under the
Advisory Agreement, we are entitled to annual compensation equal to the greater of 125%
of NHRs gross consolidated revenues or 2 $500,000. It was also clarified that NHR and
not NHC is to bear all of its own corporate costs. Prior to the August1, 2005 amendment, the Advisory Agreement had provided that for our
services under the Advisory Agreement, we were entitled to annual compensation of the
greater of 2% of our gross consolidated revenues or the actual expenses incurred by us.
During 2005, 2004, and 2003, compensation under the Advisory Agreement was $508,000 411,000, and $476,000, respectively.
Investment in NHR Common Stock At December31, 2005, we own 345,200 shares or 36% of NHRs outstanding common
stock. We account for our investment in NHR common stock as available for sale marketable
securities in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 115. Note 3 Relationship with National Health Investors, Inc. In 1991, we formed NHI as a wholly-owned subsidiary. We then transferred to NHI
certain healthcare facilities owned by NHC and distributed the shares of NHI to NHCs
shareholders. The distribution had the effect of separating NHC and NHI into two
independent public companies. As a result of the distribution, all of the outstanding
shares of NHI were distributed to the then NHC investors. NHI is listed on the New York
Stock Exchange.
Leases On December27, 2005, under an agreement to the master lease, we exercised our option
to extend the existing lease on 41 properties for the second renewal term. The 41
properties include four Florida properties that are leased to and operated by others, but
for which we continue to guarantee the lease payments to NHI under the master lease. The
15-year lease extension begins January1, 2007, and includes three additional five-year
renewal options, each at fair market value. Under the terms of the lease, base rent for
2007 will total $33,700,000 with rent thereafter escalating by 4% of the increase in
facility revenue over a 2007 base year. The lease was scheduled to expire on December31,
2006 unless extended by us. The terms of the existing lease remain in place for 2006, as
discussed below. On October17, 1991, concurrent with our conveyance of real property to NHI, we leased
from NHI the real property of 40 long-term health care centers and three retirement centers.
Each lease is for an initial term originally expiring December31, 2001, with two additional
five-year renewal terms at our option, assuming no defaults. During 56 Table of Contents 2000, we exercised our
option to extend the lease term for the first five-year renewal term under the same terms
and conditions as the initial term. We account for the leases as operating leases. During the initial term and first renewal term of the leases, we are obligated to pay
NHI annual base rent on all 43 facilities of $19,355,000 as adjusted for new construction
since inception. The leases also obligate us to pay as debt service rent all payments of interest and
principal due under each mortgage to which the conveyance of the facilities was subject.
The payments are required over the remaining life of the mortgages as of the conveyance
date, but only during the term of the lease. Payments for debt service rent are being
treated by us as payments of principal and interest if we remain obligated on the debt
obligated debt service rent and as operating
expense payments if we have been relieved of the debt obligation by the lender
non-obligated debt service rent. See Accounting Treatment of the Transfer for further
discussion. In addition to base rent and debt service rent, we must pay percentage rent to NHI
equal to 3% of the increase in the gross revenues of each facility. The percentage rent is
based on a quarterly calculation of revenue increases and is payable on a quarterly basis.
Percentage rent for 2005, 2004, and 2003 was approximately $4,525,000, $4,124,000, and
$3,708,000, respectively. Each lease with NHI is a triple net lease under which we are responsible for paying
all taxes, utilities, insurance premium costs, repairs and other charges relating to the
ownership of the facilities. We are obligated at our expense to maintain adequate insurance
on the facilities assets. We have a right of first refusal with NHI to purchase any of the properties transferred
from us should NHI receive an offer from an unrelated party during the term of the lease or
up to 180days after termination of the related lease. As the result of a fire in a building leased from NHI by one of our limited liability
company subsidiaries, the lease was terminated during the third quarter of 2004. A
provision of the lease allowed that if substantial damage occurred during the lease term, we
could terminate the lease with respect to the damaged property. Under the lease, NHC will
have no obligation to repair the property and NHI will receive the entire insurance proceeds
related to the building damage. We are obligated to continue to indemnify and hold harmless
NHI from any and all demands arising from our use of the property. NHI retains the right to
license the beds under the lease termination. On April1, 2004, we terminated, with NHIs approval, our individual lease on an 80 bed
long-term health care center located in Dawson Springs, Kentucky. On October1, 2000, we terminated our individual leases with NHI on four Florida
long-term health care facilities. However, we remain obligated to NHI under our master
lease agreement and continue to remain obligated to make the lease payments to NHI.
Subsequently, the facilities were immediately leased by NHI for a five year term to four
separate corporations, none of which we own or control. Lease payments received by NHI from
the new lessees offset our lease obligations pursuant to the master operating lease. These
leases have currently been extended through December31, 2006. Through December31, 2005,
all such lease payments have been received by NHI and offset against our obligations. Base rent expense to NHI was $19,355,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003. Non-obligated debt
service rent to NHI was $8,191,000 in 2005, $7,974,000 in 2004, and $7,369,000 in 2003. At
December31, 2005, the approximate future minimum base rent and non-obligated debt service
rent to be paid by us on non-cancelable operating leases with NHI during the initial term
are as follows 57 Table of Contents

Advisory Agreement Until November1, 2004, we had an Advisory Agreement with NHI whereby we provided to
NHI services related to investment activities and day-to-day management and operations.
During 2005, 2004, and 2003, our compensation under the NHI Advisory Agreement was $-0 2,383,000, and $2,597,000, respectively. Effective November1, 2004, NHCs Advisory Agreement with NHI was terminated. On that
date, Management Advisory Source, LLC Advisors, a new unrelated company formed by Mr.W.
Andrew Adams, undertook to provide advisory services to NHI. Mr.Adams served as NHIs
President and Board Chairman and as NHCs Chief Executive Officer and Board Chairman prior
to November1, 2004. Effective November1, 2004 and to enhance independence from NHC, Mr.
Adams resigned as NHCs Chief Executive Officer and terminated his managerial
responsibilities with NHC. Mr.Adams remains on the NHC Board as Chairman, focusing on
strategic planning, but will have no management involvement with NHC. Effective November1, 2004, NHC, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tennessee
Management Advisory Source, LLC THA has entered into an agreement to provide financial,
accounting, data processing and administrative services to Advisors. Under the agreement,
THA provides to Advisors and, at the request of Advisors, to NHI, services related to
accounting, data processing, administration and evaluation of investments. THAs role under
the agreement is that of advisor and service provider, and THA in no way assumes
responsibility for accounting, administrative, or investment decisions which are to be made
by Advisors or NHI. The term of the agreement is through December31, 2005 and thereafter from year to
year. However, either party may terminate the agreement at any time without cause upon 90
days written notice. For our services under the agreement, we are entitled to compensation of $1,250,000 per
year, payable monthly and annually inflated by 5%. In 2005, we received compensation of
approximately $1,250,000. Management Services NHI operates certain long-term health care centers on which it has foreclosed, has
accepted deeds in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise has obtained possession of the related
assets. NHI has engaged us to manage these foreclosure properties. See Notes 1 and 5 for
additional information on management fees recognized from NHI. During 2004 or prior, NHI
sold or closed all of these properties and NHC now manages for others the properties that
continue to operate. Accounting Treatment of the Transfer We have accounted for the conveyance in 1991 of assets and related debt to NHI and
the subsequent leasing of the real estate assets as a financing/leasing arrangement.
Since we were obligated on certain of the transferred debt, the obligated debt balances were
reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as debt serviced by other parties. As of
December31, 2005, we were not obligated on any debt serviced by other parties. As we
utilize the applicable real estate over the lease term, our consolidated statements of
income will reflect the continued interest expenses on the obligated 58 Table of Contents debt balances and the
additional base and non-obligated debt service rents as an operating expense payable to
NHI each year. We have indemnification provisions in our agreements with NHI if we are
required to service the debt through a default by NHI. Release from Debt Serviced by Other Parties Since 1991, we have been released from our obligation on a significant portion of
transferred debt $1,500,000 in 2005. Since we are no longer obligated on this
transferred debt, debt serviced by other parties and assets under arrangement with other
parties were reduced by the amount of the debt serviced by other parties from which we were
removed. The resulting deferred lease credit is being amortized into income over the
remaining lease term. The leases with NHI provide that we shall continue to make
non-obligated debt service rent payments equal to the debt service including principal and
interest on the obligated debt from which we have been released. At December31, 2005, no
debt serviced by other parties remains. Investment in NHI Common Stock At December31, 2005, we own 1,405,642 shares or 51% of NHIs outstanding common
stock. We account for our investment in NHI common stock as available for sale marketable
securities in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 115. Note 4 Relationship with National Health Corporation National, which is wholly-owned by the ESOP, was formed in 1986 and served as our
administrative general partner through December31, 1997, when we operated as a master
limited partnership. As discussed below, the personnel conducting our business, including
our executive management team, are employees of National and have ownership interests in
National through their participation in the ESOP. Sale of Long-Term Health Care Centers to and Notes Receivable from National During 1988, we sold the assets inventory, property and equipment of eight long-term
health care centers 1,121 licensed beds to National for a total consideration of
$40,000,000. The consideration consisted of $30,000,000 in cash and a $10,000,000 note
receivable due December31, 2007. The note receivable earns interest at 85%. We have
agreed to manage the centers under a 20-year management contract for management fees
comparable to those in the industry. With our prior consent, National sold one center to an
unrelated third party in 1997 and two centers to an unrelated third party in 1999. Thus, we
now manage five centers for National. See Notes 1 and 5 for additional information on
management fees recognized from National. Our carrying amount in the assets sold was approximately $24,255,000. The resulting
profit of $15,745,000 was deferred and will be amortized into income beginning with the
collection of the note receivable up to $12,000,000 with the balance $3,745,000 of the
profit being amortized into income on a straight-line basis over the management contract
period. In conjunction with our management contract, we have entered into a line of credit
arrangement whereby we may have amounts due to or due from National from time to time. The
maximum available borrowings under the line of credit are $2,000,000, the interest rate on
the line of credit is prime plus one percent and the final maturity is January1, 2008.
National owes NHC $992,000 at December31, 2005 and we owed National $1,181,000 at December
31, 2004 under this arrangement. These amounts have been included in or netted against
notes receivable from National on the consolidated balance sheets. After January1, 2008,
we will no longer be obligated to make loans under the line of credit arrangement. We may,
however, make short-term loans in the regular course of business. 59 Table of Contents ESOP Financing Activities During 1988, we obtained from National long-term financing of $8,500,000 for the
construction of our headquarters building. National obtained its financing through the
ESOP. The note requires quarterly principal and interest payments with interest at 9% and
is secured by the headquarters building. At December31, 2005 and 2004, the outstanding
balance on the note was approximately $1,038,000 and $1,557,000, respectively, which is
included in notes and other obligations in Note 10. The building is owned by a separate
partnership of which we are the general partner and building tenants are limited partners.
We own 697% of the partnership and consolidate the financial statements of the partnership
in our consolidated financial statements. The cumulative equity in earnings of the
partnership related to the limited partners ownership is reflected in minority interests in
consolidated subsidiaries. We have guaranteed the debt service of the building partnership. In addition, our $4,634,000 senior secured notes described in Note 10 were financed by
National. National obtained its financing through the ESOP. Our interest costs, financing
expenses and principal payments with National are consistent with National and the ESOPs
terms with their respective lenders. We also have agreed to guarantee $7,564,000 of
additional debt of National and the ESOP that is not reflected in our consolidated financial
statements. See Note 13 for additional information on guarantees. In May2004, we repaid in full our senior notes in the approximate amount of
$1,486,000. During 1991, we borrowed $10,000,000 from National. The term note payable requires
quarterly interest payments at 85%. The entire principal is due at maturity in 2007. Payroll and Related Services The personnel conducting our business, including our executive management team, are
employees of National and have ownership interests in National through their participation
in the ESOP. National provides payroll services, provides employee fringe benefits, and
maintains certain liability insurance. We pay to National all the costs of personnel
employed for our benefit, as well as an administrative fee equal to 1% of payroll costs.
Such costs totaling approximately $285,000,000, $276,000,000, and $254,000,000 for 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively, are reflected as salaries, wages and benefits in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income. The administrative fee paid to National for
2005, 2004, and 2003 was $2,393,000, $2,303,000, and $2,128,000, respectively. As of
December31, 2005 National owes us $992,000 and at December31, 2004, we owed National
$1,181,000 as a result of the differences between interim payments for payroll and benefits
services costs that we made during the respective year and such actual costs. These
receivables are included in or netted against notes receivable from National in the
consolidated balance sheets. National maintains and makes contributions to its ESOP for the
benefit of eligible employees. Notes Receivable from the ESOP During 2000, we purchased at face value from NHI $23,200,000 of notes receivable due
from the ESOP. NHI had purchased the note receivable from the previous holders which were
banks. The notes receivable represent funds that were originally obtained by the ESOP from
outside lenders and loaned to National and subsequently loaned by National to NHI, NHR and
NHC. In May2004, the notes were repaid in full. NHI repaid $2,400,000 of the notes, NHR
repaid $1,828,000 of the notes and we repaid $1,486,000 of the notes. Nationals Ownership of Our Stock At December31, 2005 and 2004, National owns 1,238,924 shares or approximately 101%
of our outstanding common stock. 60 Table of Contents Note 5 Other Revenues and Income Other revenues are outlined in the table below. Revenues from insurance services
include premiums for workers compensation and professional and general liability insurance
policies that our wholly-owned insurance subsidiaries have written for certain long-term
health care centers to which we provide management or accounting services. Revenues from
management and accounting services include management and accounting fees and revenues from
other services provided to managed and other long-term health care centers. Other
revenues include non-health care related earnings.

included in management and accounting service fees. Unrecognized and unpaid management fees
from NHI total $4,209,000 and $12,333,000 at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
receipt of payment for these fees is subject to collectibility issues and negotiation.
Consistent with our policy, we will only recognize these unrecognized fees as revenue if and
when cash is collected. Accounting Service Fees and Rental Income from Florida Centers During 2005, 2004, and 2003, we recognized $5,220,000, $5,274,000, and $5,368,000,
respectively, of accounting services fees from long-term health care centers in Florida that
we previously operated or managed. Amounts recognized are included in management and
accounting service fees. During 2005, 2004, and 2003, we also recognized $3,250,000, $3,543,000, and $3,548,000,
respectively, of rental income from the divested operations of long-term health care centers
in Florida related to our two owned facilities and the furniture, fixtures and leasehold
improvements of 13 other facilities previously leased from NHI and NHR. These amounts are
included in rental income. 61 Table of Contents Note 6 Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares

At December31, 2005, we have obligations to complete construction of approximately
$7,932,000. Note 9 Notes Receivable At December31, 2003, the outstanding principal balances of notes receivable from NHR,
National and the ESOP were $14,924,000, $9,728,000 and $5,714,000, respectively. During
2004, the balance of the notes receivable from NHR and the ESOP were repaid. At December
31, 2005, we have notes receivable from National of approximately $10,992,000. In addition to our notes receivable from National, we have notes receivable from
managed and other long-term health care centers, the proceeds of which were used by the
long-term health care centers for construction costs, development costs incurred during
construction and working capital during initial operating periods. The notes generally
require monthly payments with maturities beginning in 2006 through 2007. Interest on the
notes is generally at rates ranging from prime plus 2% to 7%. The collateral for the notes
consists of first and second mortgages, certificates of need, personal guarantees and stock
pledges. 63 Table of Contents In March, 2005, we recorded a $1,000,000 writedown of a note receivable due from a 120
bed long-term health care center in Missouri that we manage. The writedown was recorded as
a result of the lack of increase in reimbursement rates and a resulting decline in the cash
flows of the center. The center has not made a principal payment on this note since
December31, 2001. Based on an analysis consistent with the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan -
an Amendment of FASB Statement No5 and 15, we concluded that the writedown of $1,000,000
was required. Note 10 Long-Term Debt, Debt Serviced by Other Parties and Lease Commitments Long-Term Debt and Debt Serviced by Other Parties Long-term debt and debt serviced by other parties consist of the following

The $6,097,000 senior secured notes and the $1,486,000 senior notes repaid in 2004
were borrowed from National. National obtained its financing through the ESOP. As we are a
direct obligor on this debt, it has been reflected in the table above as liabilities owed by
us to the holders of the debt instruments rather than as liabilities owed to National and
the ESOP. Of the $1,395,000 notes and other obligations, $1,038,000 is owed to National. The
note is secured by NHCs headquarters building. 64 Table of Contents The aggregate maturities of long-term debt and debt serviced by other parties for the

Through a guarantee agreement, as discussed in Note 13, our $4,634,000 senior secured
notes have cross-default provisions with other debt of National. Certain loan agreements
require maintenance of specified operating ratios as well as specified levels of working
capital and stockholders equity by us and by National. All such covenants have been met by
us and we believe that National is in compliance with or has obtained waivers or amendments
to remedy all events of non-compliance with the covenants as of December31, 2005. Construction Commitments NHC has entered into agreements to complete construction of leasehold improvements at
various long-term health care facilities at December31, 2005. We remain obligated in the
amount of approximately $7,932,000 on construction contracts. Lease Commitments Operating expenses for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 include
expenses for leased premises and equipment under operating leases of $42,049,000 41,034,000, and $41,537,000, respectively. See Notes 2 and 3 for the approximate future
minimum rent commitments on non-cancelable operating leases with NHR and NHI. Note 11 Income Taxes The provision for income taxes is comprised of the following components

The exercise of non-qualified stock options results in state and federal income tax
benefits to the Company related to the difference between the market price at the date of
exercise and the option price. During 2005 and 2004, $207,000 and $6,359,000, respectively,
attributable to the tax benefit of stock options exercised, was credited to additional
paid-in capital. NHC continually evaluates for tax related contingencies. Contingencies may arise where
tax laws may allow for alternative interpretations or where the timing of recognition of
income is subject to judgment. We believe we have adequate provisions for tax
contingencies. However, because of uncertainty of interpretation by various tax authorities
and the possibility that there are issues that have not been recognized by management, we
cannot guarantee we have accurately estimated our tax liabilities. We believe we have made
adequate provision for tax contingencies. Note 12 Stock Option Plan We have incentive option plans that provide for the granting of options to key
employees and directors to purchase shares of common stock at no less than market value on
the date of grant. Options issued to non-employee directors vest immediately and have a
maximum five year term. Options issued to employees in 2000 vest over a six year period and
have a maximum six year term. Options issued to employees in 2004 vest over a five year
period and have a maximum five year term. The following table summarizes option activity 66 Table of Contents

At December31, 2005, 200,000 options outstanding are exercisable. The weighted
average remaining contractual life of options outstanding at December31, 2005 is 33years. Additionally, we have an employee stock purchase plan that allows employees to purchase
our shares of stock through payroll deductions. The plan allows employees to terminate
participation at any time. In connection with the exercise of certain stock options, we have received 557%
interest-bearing, full recourse notes in the amount of $16,000 at December31, 2003. The
notes were repaid in 2004. During 2003, we accepted unexercised stock options for 55,000 shares of our common
stock from a former employee and current member of our board of directors in satisfaction of
that individuals $433,000 note payable to us. Accordingly, we recognized $433,000 of
salaries, wages and benefits expense in the 2003 consolidated statement of income. In May2005, our shareholders approved the 2005 National HealthCare Corporation Stock
Option, Employee Stock Purchase, Physician Stock Purchase and Stock Appreciation Rights
Plan. We have reserved 1,158,051 shares of common stock for issuance under these plans. Note 13 Contingencies and Guarantees Self Insurance We have assumed certain self-insurance risks related to health insurance, workers
compensation and general and professional liability insurance claims both for our owned or
leased entities and certain of the entities to which we provide management or accounting
services. The liability we have recognized for reported claims and estimates for incurred
but unreported claims totals $70,290,000 and $62,354,000 at December31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The liability is included in accrued risk reserves in the consolidated
balance sheets. The amounts are subject to adjustment for actual claims incurred. It is
possible that these claims plus unasserted claims could exceed our insurance coverages 67 Table of Contents and
our reserves, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results
of operations and cash flows. As a result of the terms of our insurance policies and our use of a wholly-owned
insurance company, we have retained significant insurance risk with respect to general and
professional liability. We use independent actuaries to estimate our exposures for claims
obligations for both asserted and unasserted claims related to deductibles and exposures
in excess of coverage limits, and we maintain reserves for these obligations. Such
estimates are based on many variables including historical and statistical information and
other factors. It is possible that claims against us could exceed our coverage limits and
our reserves, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results
of operations and cash flows. Workers Compensation For workers compensation, we utilize a wholly-owned Tennessee domiciled
property/casualty insurance company to write coverage for NHC affiliates and for third-party
customers. Policies are written for a duration of twelve months and cover only risks
related to workers compensation losses. All customers are companies which operate in the
long-term care industry. Business is written on both an assumed and a direct basis. For
the business written on an assumed basis the insurance company assumes only the first
$750,000 of losses for each claim. For direct business, coverage is written for statutory
limits and the insurance companys losses in excess of $500,000 per claim are covered by
reinsurance. For these insurance operations, the premium revenues reflected in the financial
statements as Other revenues for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, are $13,554,000 12,996,000, and $10,641,000. Associated losses and expenses reflected in the financial
statements as Other operating costs and expenses are $1,999,000, $4,292,000, and
$2,144,000 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As a result of the terms of our insurance policies and our use of a wholly-owned
insurance company, we have retained significant self insurance risk with respect to workers
compensation liability. We use independent actuaries to estimate our exposures for claims
obligations for both asserted and unasserted claims related to deductibles and exposures
in excess of coverage limits, and we maintain reserves for these obligations. It is
possible that claims against us could exceed our coverage limits and our reserves, which
would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and
cash flows. General and Professional Liability Lawsuits and Insurance Across the nation, the entire long term care industry has experienced a dramatic
increase in personal injury/wrongful death claims and awards based on alleged negligence by
nursing facilities and their employees in providing care to residents. As of December31,
2005, we and/or our managed centers are currently defendants in 59 such claims covering the
years 1995 through December31, 2005. Two of these 59 claims are currently pending in
relation to the September25, 2003 fire discussed below. Thirteen of the 59 suits are in
Florida, where we have not operated or managed long-term care providers since September30,
2000. Of the thirteen Florida suits, six suits relate to events before and seven suits
relate to events after our cessation of business in Florida. These latter seven suits
assert allegations of continued exposure even after we ceased operations. When bids were solicited for third party professional liability insurance coverage for
2002, only two companies would quote coverage. Both quotations were so onerous and
expensive that we elected to pay the premiums into a wholly-owned licensed captive insurance
company, incorporated in the Cayman Islands, for the purpose of managing the Companys
losses related to these risks. Thus, for years 2002-2005, insurance coverage for incidents
occurring at all providers owned or leased, and most providers managed by us, is provided
through this wholly-owned insurance company. Policies are written for a duration of twelve
months. 68 Table of Contents Our coverages for all years include both primary policies and excess policies.
Commending with 2002, deductibles were eliminated with first dollar coverage being provided
through the wholly-owned insurance company. The excess coverage is provided by a third
party insuror for 2002. For 2003-2005, both primary professional liability insurance coverage and excess
coverage is provided through our wholly-owned liability insurance company in the amount of
$1million per incident, $3million per location with an aggregate primary policy limit of
$110million, $120million, and $140million, respectively. There is a $75million
annual excess aggregate applicable to each year. For these professional liability insurance operations, the premium revenues reflected
in the financials as Other revenues for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, are $4,095,000 3,852,000, and $3,944,000. Associated losses and expenses including those for
self-insurance are included in the financial statements as Other operating costs and
expenses. These costs total $4,278,000, $15,703,000, and $6,182,000 for 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. Nashville Fire On September25, 2003, a tragic fire occurred on the second floor of a skilled nursing
facility located in Nashville, Tennessee operated by one of our limited liability company
subsidiaries. While the concrete and steel constructed facility complied with applicable
fire safety codes, the building was not equipped with fire sprinklers. Although the fire
was predominantly confined to a patients room, extensive smoke filled the area and caused
injuries to other patients despite aggressive efforts to evacuate these patients by NHC
employees, fire department personnel and other volunteers. There were sixteen patient
deaths subsequent to the fire, an undetermined number of which may be related to the events
of September25, 2003. The fire produced extensive media coverage, specifically focused on the fact that
health care centers, including hospitals, constructed prior to 1994 are not required by
Tennessee law or regulations to be fully sprinkled if constructed with fire resistant
materials. Irrespective of code standards, we undertook to install fire sprinklers in all
of owned and leased long-term care centers, which installation is now completed. We
proactively sought to resolve any questions and/or losses with patients and their families.
Of a total of 32 lawsuits filed against us, 30 have been settled. Two lawsuits are
currently pending. The cases were consolidated in the Third Circuit Court for Davidson
County, Tennessee. Discovery is ongoing in the remaining two cases. The Company continues
to vigorously defend against the allegations in these lawsuits while seeking settlement and
final resolution with residents and their families. Additionally, in connection with the fire, we have incurred losses and costs associated
with interruption of business, as we have closed the center. For the year ended December
31, 2004, we received or accrued $1,404,000 of insurance recoveries from third-party
insurance carriers. Amounts of insurance recoveries received in 2005 are immaterial in
amount when netted against the related expenses. These insurance recoveries reduced our
losses and costs and were included in other operating expenses in the consolidated
statements of income. The building involved in the fire was leased by one of our limited liability company
subsidiaries from National Health Investors, Inc. NHI. We terminated the lease during
the third quarter of 2004. A provision of the lease allowed that if substantial damage
occurred during the lease term, we could terminate the lease with respect to the damaged
property. Under the lease, NHC had no obligation to repair the property and NHI was
entitled to all insurance proceeds related to the building damage. We are obligated to
continue to indemnify and hold harmless NHI from any and all demands arising from our use of
the property. NHI retained the right to license the beds under the lease termination. NHC
terminated the Nashville lease with NHI. Consistent with the provisions of SFAS 5, we have accrued for probable and estimatible
losses related to the Nashville fire and have included our estimates of these losses in
accrued risk reserves in the consolidated balance sheet. It is possible that claims against
us related to the Nashville fire could exceed our estimates, which would have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 69 Table of Contents Guarantees In addition to our primary debt obligations, which are included in our consolidated
financial statements, we have guaranteed the debt obligations of certain other entities.
Those guarantees, which are not included as debt obligations in our consolidated financial
statements, total $16,833,000 at December31, 2005 and include $9,269,000 of debt of managed
and other long-term health care centers and $7,564,000 of debt of National and the ESOP. The $9,269,000 of guarantees of debt of managed and other long-term health care centers
relates to first mortgage debt obligations of three long-term health care centers to which
we provide management or accounting services. We have agreed to guarantee these obligations
in order to obtain management or accounting services agreements. For this service, we
charge an annual guarantee fee of 05% to 20% of the outstanding principal balance
guaranteed, which fee is in addition to our management or accounting services fee. All of
this guaranteed indebtedness is secured by first mortgages, pledges of personal property,
accounts receivable, marketable securities and, in certain instances, the personal
guarantees of the owners of the facilities. The $7,564,000 of guarantees of debt of National and the ESOP relates to senior secured
notes held by financial institutions. The total outstanding balance of National and the
ESOPs obligations under these senior secured notes is $12,198,000. As discussed in Note
10, $4,634,000 of this obligation has been included in our debt obligations because we are a
direct obligor on this indebtedness. The remaining $7,564,000, which is not included in our
debt obligations because we are not a direct obligor, is due from NHI to National and the
ESOP. Additionally, under the amended terms dated March31, 2005 of these note
agreements, the right of the lending institutions to require NHC to purchase the notes at
par value under a guaranty and continency purchase agreement has been removed. As of December31, 2005, our maximum potential loss related to the guarantees is
$16,833,000, which is the outstanding balance of the guaranteed debt obligations. We have
accrued approximately $1,044,000 for potential losses as a result of our guarantees, which
is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Debt Cross Defaults Through a guarantee agreement, our senior secured notes have cross-default provisions
with other debt of National and the ESOP. We currently believe that National and the ESOP
are in compliance with the terms of their debt agreements. Under the terms of one of
Nationals debt obligations to financial institutions total balance of $4,138,000 at
December31, 2005, none of which is our obligation, the lending institutions have the right
to put the entire outstanding balance of the debt to National in March2005. Under the
amended terms dated March31, 2005 of these note agreements, the right of the lending
institutions to require NHC to purchase the notes at par value under a guaranty and
continency purchase agreement has been removed. Outstanding Offer to Purchase Facility Under the terms of our management agreement for a 176 bed long-term care center located
in Aiken, South Carolina, we have attempted to exercise our right of first refusal to
purchase the center for $8,448,000. Our right to purchase the facility is being disputed by
the owner, and we have filed a request for a declaratory judgment in order that the court
rule on the enforceability of the management contract and the right of first refusal. We
currently are continuing to manage operations of the facility and earn approximately
$500,000 annually in management fee revenues from the facility. Note 14 Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts
payable approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. We calculate the fair values
of other financial instruments based upon our estimate of current industry conditions and
relevant factors. At December31, 2005 and 2004, there were no material differences between
the carrying amounts and fair values of NHCs financial instruments. 70 Table of Contents To meet the reporting requirements of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No.
