With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 1992, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March31, 2015. Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and has also audited the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2015. This audit report appears on page 53 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. May12, 2015/s/ John H. HammergrenJohn H.

BeerExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerPrincipal Financial Officer52Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of McKesson Corporation:We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McKesson Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of March 31, 2015and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2015. Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedule financial statement schedule listed in the Index at . We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 1992 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule, and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of McKesson Corporation and subsidiaries as of March31, 2015and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 1992 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. /s/ Deloitte Touche LLPSan Francisco, CaliforniaMay 12, 201553Table of ContentsMcKESSON

the Company, the Registrant or we and other similar pronouns delivers pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and healthcare information technology that make healthcare safer while reducing costs. We conduct our business through two operating segments, McKesson Distribution Solutions and McKesson Technology Solutions, as further described in Financial Note 26, Segments of Business.Basis of Presentation: The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP. The consolidated financial statements of McKesson include the financial statements of all wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned or controlled companies. We also evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if they are variable interest entities VIEs, if we have a variable interest in those entities and the nature and extent of those interests. Refer to Financial Note 16, Variable Interest Entities for more information on VIEs. Investments in business entities in which we do not have control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method and our proportionate share of income or loss is recorded in other income, net. Equity investments in non-publicly traded entities are primarily accounted for using the cost method. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Fiscal Period: The Companys fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year shall mean the Companys fiscal year.Reclassifications: Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual amounts could differ from those estimated amounts.Cash and Cash Equivalents: All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition are included in cash and cash equivalents.Cash equivalents, which are available-for-sale, are carried at fair value. Cash equivalents are primarily invested in AAA rated prime and U.S. government money market funds denominated in U.S. dollars, AAA rated prime money market funds denominated in Euros, overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities, Canadian government securities and/or securities that are guaranteed or sponsored by the U.S. government and an AAA rated prime money market fund denominated in British pound sterling.The remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions. Deposits at U.S. banks exceed the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds. Restricted Cash: Cash that is subject to legal restrictions or is unavailable for general operating purposes is classified as restricted cash and is included within prepaid expenses and other for current balances and other assets for non-current balances in the consolidated balance sheets. At March31, 2015and 2014, restricted cash was not material.Marketable Securities Available-for-Sale: We carry our marketable securities, which are available-for-sale, at fair value and they are included in prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, computed in marking these securities to market have been reported within stockholders equity. At March31,2015and 2014, marketable securities were not material59Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedIn determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in market value has occurred, we consider the duration that, and extent to which, the fair value of the investment is below its cost, the financial condition and future prospects of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security, and our intent and ability to retain the security in order to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value. Other-than-temporary declines in fair value from amortized cost for available-for-sale equity securities that we intend to sell or would more likely than not be required to sell before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis are charged to other income, net, in the period in which the loss occurs. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Receivables: Our trade receivables are subject to a concentration of credit risk with customers primarily in our Distribution Solutions segment. During 2015, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 44%of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Caremark Corporation CVS, accounted for approximately 15%of our total consolidated revenues. At March31, 2015, trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 36%of total trade accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVSwere approximately 14%of total trade accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. We also have agreements with group purchasing organizations GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers. The accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the GPOs. A default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers, or the loss of a large customer or customer groups could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, trade receivables are subject to a concentration of credit risk with customers in the institutional, retail and healthcare provider sectors, which can be affected by a downturn in the economy and changes in reimbursement policies. This credit risk is mitigated by the size and diversity of the customer base as well as its geographic dispersion. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and ongoing evaluations of the creditworthiness of our customers. An allowance is recorded in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts.Financing Receivables: We assess and monitor credit risk associated with financing receivables, namely lease and notes receivables, through regular review of our collection experience in determining our allowance for loan losses. On an ongoing basis, we also evaluate credit quality of our financing receivables utilizing aging of receivables and write-offs, as well as considering existing economic conditions, to determine if an allowance is necessary. Financing receivables are derecognized if legal title to them has been transferred and all related risks and rewards incidental to ownership have passed to the buyer. As of March31,2015and 2014, financing receivables and the related allowance were not material to our consolidated financial statements.Inventories: We report inventories at the lower of cost or market LCM. Inventories for our Distribution Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale. For our Distribution Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the last-in, first-out LIFO method. The majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign locations is based on weighted average purchase prices using the first-in, first-out method. Technology Solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost generally determined by the standard cost method, which approximates average cost. Rebates, cash discounts, and other incentives received from vendors are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. The LIFO method was used to value approximately 73%and 67%of our inventories at March31, 2015and 2014. If we had used the FIFO method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement costs, inventories would have been approximately $768millionand $431millionhigher than the amounts reported at March31,2015and 2014, respectively. These amounts are equivalent to our LIFO reserves. Our LIFO valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. In 2015, 2014and 2013, we recognized LIFO related expenses of $337 million, $311millionand $13 millionin cost of sales within our consolidated statements of operations. A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory.We believe that the average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory i.e., market. As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or market. Due to cumulative net price deflation from 2005 to 2013, we had a lower-of-cost or market LCM reserve of $60 millionat March 31, 2013 which reduced pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO to market. During 2014, the LCM reserve of $60 millionwas released, resulting in an increase in gross profit. As of March 31, 2014 and 2015, inventories at LIFO did not exceed market60Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedShipping and Handling Costs: We include costs to warehouse, pick, pack and deliver inventory to our customers in selling, distribution and administrative expenses.Property, Plant and Equipment: We state our property, plant and equipment at cost and depreciate them under the straight-line method at rates designed to distribute the cost of properties over estimated service lives ranging from oneto thirtyyears.Goodwill: Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as a             component one level below our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that unit.The first step in goodwill testing requires us to compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. This step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is lower than its estimated fair value, no further evaluation is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. Under the second step, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in a hypothetical analysis by subtracting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, from the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in the first step of the impairment test. If the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for that excess.  To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return. The discount rate used for cash flows reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business. In addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units fair value to the Companys market capitalization as a further corroboration of the fair values. The testing requires a complex series of assumptions and judgment by management in projecting future operating results, selecting guideline companies for comparisons and assessing risks. The use of alternative assumptions and estimates could affect the fair values and change the impairment determinations.Intangible Assets: Currently all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from oneto thirty-eightyears. We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair market value. Capitalized Software Held for Sale: Development costs for software held for sale, which primarily pertain to our Technology Solutions segment, are capitalized once a project has reached the point of technological feasibility. Completed projects are amortized after reaching the point of general availability using the straight-line method based on an estimated useful life of approximately threeyears. At each balance sheet date, or earlier if an indicator of an impairment exists, we evaluate the recoverability of unamortized capitalized software costs based on estimated future undiscounted revenues net of estimated related costs over the remaining amortization period. Capitalized Software Held for Internal Use: We capitalize costs of software held for internal use during the application development stage of a project and amortize those costs over their estimated useful lives ranging from oneto tenyears. As of March31, 2015and 2014, capitalized software held for internal use was $435 millionand $508 million, net of accumulated amortization of $1,112 millionand $1,004 million, and was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.Insurance Programs:Under our insurance programs, we seek to obtain coverage for catastrophic exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. It is our policy to retain a significant portion of certain losses primarily related to workers compensation and comprehensive general, product and vehicle liability. Provisions for losses expected under these programs are recorded based upon our estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred as well as for claims incurred but not yet reported. Such estimates utilize certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry61Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedRevenue Recognition:Distribution SolutionsRevenues for our Distribution Solutions segment are recognized when product is delivered and title passes to the customer or when services have been rendered and there are no further obligations to the customer.Revenues are recorded net of sales returns, allowances, rebates and other incentives. Our sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if they can be resold for value or returned to suppliers for full credit. Sales returns are accrued based on estimates at the time of sale to the customer. Sales returns from customers were approximately $27 billionin 2015and $19billionin 2014and 2013. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presentedon a net basis; that is, they are excluded from revenues.Revenues for our Distribution Solutions segment include large volume sales of pharmaceuticals primarily to a limited number of large customers who warehouse their own product. We order bulk product from the manufacturer, receive and process the product primarily through our central distribution facility and deliver the bulk product generally in the same form as received from the manufacturer directly to our customers warehouses. We also record revenues for direct store deliveries from most of these same customers. Direct store deliveries are shipments from the manufacturer to our customers of a limited category of products that require special handling. We assume the primary liability to the manufacturer for these products.Revenues are recorded gross when we are the primary party obligated in the transaction, take title to and possession of the inventory, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices, assume the risk of loss for collection from customers as well as delivery or return of the product, are responsible for fulfillment and other customer service requirements, or the transactions have several but not all of these indicators.Our Distribution Solutions segment also engages in multiple-element arrangements, which may contain a combination of various products and services. Revenue from a multiple-element arrangement is allocated to the separate elements based on their relative selling price and recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition criteria applicable to each element. Relative selling price is determined based on vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE of selling price, if available, third-party evidence TPE, if VSOE of selling price is not available, or estimated selling price ESP, if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE is available. Technology SolutionsRevenues for our Technology Solutions segment are generated primarily by licensing software and software systems consisting of software, hardware and maintenance support, providing software as a service or SaaS-based solutions and providing claims processing, outsourcing and professional services. Revenue for this segment is recognized as follows:Software systems are marketed under information systems agreements as well as service agreements. Perpetual software arrangements are recognized at the time of delivery or under the percentage-of-completion method if the arrangements require significant production, modification or customization of the software. Contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method are generally measured based on the ratio of labor hours incurred to date to total estimated labor hours to be incurred. Changes in estimates to complete and revisions in overall profit estimates on these contracts are charged to earnings in the period in which they are determined. We accrue for contract losses if and when the current estimate of total contract costs exceeds total contract revenue.Revenue from time-based software license agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Software implementation fees are recognized as the work is performed or under the percentage-of-completion method. Maintenance and support agreements are marketed under annual or multi-year agreements and are recognized ratably over the period covered by the agreements. Hardware revenues are generally recognized upon delivery.SaaS-based subscription, content and transaction processing fees are generally marketed under annual and multi-year agreements and are recognized ratably over the contracted terms beginning on the service start date for fixed fee arrangements and recognized as transactions are performed beginning on the service start date for per-transaction fee arrangements. Remote processing service fees are recognized monthly as the service is performed. Outsourcing service revenues are recognized as the service is performed62Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedWe also offer certain products on an application service provider basis, making our software functionality available on a remote hosting basis from our data centers. The data centers provide system and administrative support, as well as hosting services. Revenue on products sold on an application service provider basis is recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract beginning on the service start date of products hosted.This segment engages in multiple-element arrangements, which may contain any combination of software, hardware, implementation, SaaS-based offerings, consulting services or maintenance services. For multiple-element arrangements that do not include software, revenue is allocated to the separate elements based on their relative selling price and recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition criteria applicable to each element. Relative selling price is determined based on VSOE of selling price if available, TPE, if VSOE of selling price is not available, or ESP if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE is available. For multiple-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with specific software accounting guidance when some elements are delivered prior to others in an arrangement and VSOE of fair value exists for the undelivered elements, revenue for the delivered elements is recognized upon delivery of such items. The segment establishes VSOE for hardware and implementation and consulting services based on the price charged when sold separately, and for maintenance services, based on renewal rates offered to customers. Revenue for the software element is recognized under the residual method only when fair value has been established for all of the undelivered elements in an arrangement. If fair value cannot be established for any undelivered element, all of the arrangements revenue is deferred until the delivery of the last element or until the fair value of the undelivered element is determinable. For multiple-element arrangements with both software elements and nonsoftware elements, arrangement consideration is allocated between the software elements as a whole and nonsoftware elements. The segment then further allocates consideration to the individual elements within the software group, and revenue is recognized for all elements under the applicable accounting guidance and our policies described above. Supplier Incentives:Fees for service and other incentives received from suppliers, relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory, are generally reported as a reduction to cost of goods sold. We consider these fees and other incentives to represent product discounts and as a result, the amounts are recorded as a reduction of product cost and are recognized through cost of goods sold upon the sale of the related inventory.Supplier Reserves: We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. We evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. As of March31, 2015and 2014supplier reserves were $167 millionand $181 million. The ultimate outcome of any outstanding claims may be different than our estimate. All of the supplier reserves at March31, 2015and 2014pertain to our Distribution Solutions segment.Income Taxes:We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percentlikely of being realized upon effective settlements. Deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are considered to be permanently reinvested.Foreign Currency Translation:Our international subsidiaries generally consider their local currency to be their functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Currency translation adjustments for the year are included in other comprehensive income or loss in the statements of consolidated comprehensive income, and the cumulative effect is included in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. When we sell all or substantially all of an international entity, the related share of the cumulative currency translation adjustment is removed from stockholders equity and is included in the gain or loss on sale in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains and losses from currency exchange transactions are recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material to our consolidated results of operations in 2015, 2014or 201363Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedDerivative Financial Instruments:Derivative financial instruments are used principally in the management of foreign currency and interest rate exposures and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. If a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are included in other comprehensive income or loss in the statements of consolidated comprehensive income, and the cumulative effect is included in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. The cumulative changes in fair value are reclassed to the consolidated statements of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. We periodically evaluate hedge effectiveness, and ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. Derivative instruments not designated as hedges are marked-to-market at the end of each accounting period with the change included in earnings. Comprehensive Income: Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, and gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. Our other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges, as well asunrealized gains and losses on retirement-related benefit plans. Noncontrolling and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests: Noncontrolling interests represent the portion of profit or loss, net assets and comprehensive income that is not allocable to McKesson Corporation. In 2015, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily represents guaranteed dividends and recurring compensation that McKesson is obligated to pay to the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio. Noncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put rights, that are not solely within the Companys control are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are presented outside of Stockholders Equity on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Financial Note 3, Noncontrolling Interests, for more information.Share-Based Compensation:We account for all share-based compensation transactions using a fair-value based measurement method. The share-based compensation expense, for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The compensation expense recognized has been classified in the consolidated statements of operations or capitalized on the consolidated balance sheets in the same manner as cash compensation paid to our employees.Loss Contingencies:We are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate.Business Combinations:We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained of a business, 100%of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. 64Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedSeveral valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the assets life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.Recently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsBusiness Combinations: In November 2014, amended guidance related to pushdown accounting was issued and became effective immediately. This guidance provides an acquired entity with an option to use the acquirers accounting and reporting basis in the preparation of its separate financial statements when an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. The option to apply pushdown accounting can be elected for each individual change-of-control event. The adoption of this amended guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.Cumulative Translation Adjustment: In the first quarter of 2015, we adopted amended guidance for parents accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or group of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity. The amended guidance requires the release of any cumulative translation adjustment into net income only upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of a controlling interest in a subsidiary or a group of assets within a foreign entity. Also, it requires the release of all or a pro rata portion of the cumulative translation adjustment to net income in the case of sale of an equity method investment that is a foreign entity. The adoption of this amended guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedFees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement: In April 2015, amended guidance was issued for a customers accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The amended guidance requires customers to determine whether or not an arrangement contains a software license element. If the arrangement contains a software element, the related fees paid should be accounted for as an acquisition of a software license. If the arrangement does not contain a software license, it is accounted for as a service contract. The amended guidance will become effective for us commencing in the first quarter of 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our consolidated financial statements. Debt Issuance Costs: In April 2015, amended guidance was issued for the balance sheet presentation of debt issuance costs and will become effective for us commencing in the first quarter of 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The amended guidance requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be reported in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amended guidance. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.Consolidation: In February 2015, amended guidance was issued for consolidating legal entities in which a reporting entity holds a variable interest. The amended guidance modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs and changes the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. The amended guidance will become effective for us commencing in the first quarter of 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our consolidated financial statements.Discontinued Operations: In April 2014, amended guidance was issued for reporting of discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components. The amended guidance revises the criteria for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations and permitssignificant continuing involvement and continuing cash flows with the discontinued operation. In addition, the amended guidance requires additional disclosures for discontinued operations and new disclosures for individually material disposal transactions that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. The amended guidance is effective for us prospectively commencing in the first quarter of 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our consolidated financial statements65Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedRevenue Recognition: In May 2014, amended guidance was issued for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The amended guidance eliminated industry specific guidance and applies to all companies. Revenues will be recognized when an entity satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled for that good or service. Revenue from a contract that contains multiple performance obligations is allocated to each performance obligation generally on a relative standalone selling price basis. The amended guidance also requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. The amended guidance is effective for us commencing in the first quarter of 2018. The amended guidance allows for either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our consolidated financial statements2.Business CombinationsFiscal 2014On February6, 2014, we completed the acquisition of 776%of the then outstanding common shares of Celesio AGCelesio and certain convertible bonds of Celesio for cash consideration of $45 billion, net of cash acquired the Acquisition. Upon the acquisition, our ownership of Celesios fully diluted common shares was 756%and, as required, we consolidated Celesios debt with a fair value of $23 billionas a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. The Acquisition was initially funded by utilizing a senior bridge loan, our existing accounts receivable sales facility and cash on hand. Celesio is an international wholesale and retail company and a provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors. Celesios headquarters is in Stuttgart, Germany and it operates in 14 countries around the world.The acquisition of Celesio expanded our global geographic area. Financial results for Celesio are included within our International pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which is part of our Distribution Solutions segment, since the date of Acquisition. From February7,2014 through March 31, 2014, substantially all of the convertible bonds issued by Celesio held by both third parties and us were converted into an additional 209 millioncommon shares of Celesio and approximately $30 millionin cash. At March 31, 2014, we owned approximately 754%of Celesios outstanding and fully diluted common shares.The fair value measurements of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Celesio as of the acquisition date were finalized upon completion of the measurement period. The following table summarizes the final amounts of the fair value recognized for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date as well as adjustments made during the measurement period. Among the adjustments recorded, the fair value of the acquired intangible assets decreased by $709 million. The fair value was primarily determined by applying the income approach using unobservable inputs for projected cash flows, which were refined during the measurement period and are considered Level 3 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance. These refinements did not have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets or cash flows in any period and, therefore, we have not retrospectively adjusted our financial statements66Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedIn millionsAmountsPreviously  Period AdjustmentsAmounts Recognized as of Acquisition Date Final as  current assets, net of cash and cash equivalents  assets3,0187092,309Other long-term assets1,272391,233Current  borrowings and current portion of long-term debt1,9901,990Long-term debt322322Other long-term  value of net assets, less cash and cash equivalents5,99756,002Less: Noncontrolling Interests1,50051,505Net assets acquired, net of cash and cash equivalents$4,497$$4,497The excess of the purchase price and the noncontrolling interests over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, which primarily reflects the expected future benefits to be realized upon integrating the business. Most of the goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.Domination and Profit and Loss Transfer AgreementOn May 22, 2014, Celesio and McKesson, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, McKesson Deutschland GmbH Co. KGaA McKesson Deutschland, formerly known as Dragonfly GmbH Co. KGaA, entered into the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement the Domination Agreement subject to Celesio shareholder approval and German registration requirements. Under the Domination Agreement, Celesio subordinates its management to McKesson and undertakes to transfer all of its annual profits to McKesson, and McKesson undertakes to compensate any annual losses incurred by Celesio and to grant, subject to a potential court review, the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio i an annual recurring compensation of 083per Celesio share Compensation Amount, ii a one-time dividend for Celesios fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 of 083per Celesio share reduced accordingly for any dividend paid by Celesio in relation to its fiscal year ended December31,2014 Guaranteed Dividend and iii a right to put Put Right their Celesio shares at 2299per share increased annually for interest in the amount of 5percentage points above a base rate published by the German Bundesbank semiannually, less any Compensation Amount or Guaranteed Dividend already paid in respect of the relevant time period Put Amount. The Domination Agreement does not have an expiration date and can be terminated by McKesson without cause in writing no earlier than March31,2020. The Domination Agreement was approved at the general shareholders meeting of Celesio on July 15, 2014, approved by the Stuttgart Higher Regional Court for registration on December2,2014, and was registered in the commercial register of Celesio at the local court of Stuttgart on December 2, 2014. As a result, McKesson obtained the ability to pursue integration of the two companies on December 2, 2014.Under the Domination Agreement, the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio no longer participate in their percentage ownership of Celesios profits and losses, but instead have the right to receive the one-time Guaranteed Dividend and prospectively the Compensation Amount. 67Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedSubsequent to the Domination Agreements registration, certain noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio initiated appraisal proceedings Appraisal Proceedings with the Stuttgart Higher Regional Court to challenge the Compensation Amount, Guaranteed Dividend and/or Put Amount. As long as any Appraisal Proceedings are pending, the Compensation Amount, Guaranteed Dividend and/or Put Amount will be paid as specified currently in the Domination Agreement. If any such Appraisal Proceedings result in an adjustment to the Compensation Amount, Guaranteed Dividend and/or Put Amount, McKesson Deutschland would be required to make certain additional payments for any shortfall to all Celesio noncontrolling shareholders who previously received the Guaranteed Dividend, Compensation Amount and/or Put Amount. The Put Right specified in the Domination Agreement may be exercised until two months after the announcement regarding the end of the Appraisal Proceedings. In addition, if the Domination Agreement is terminated, the Put Right may be exercised for a two-month period after the date of termination.On August 14, 2014, Magnetar Capital filed a lawsuit against Celesio with the Stuttgart Regional Court claiming that the shareholders approval of the Domination Agreement was void under the German Stock Corporation Act Main Proceedings. As the Domination Agreement was registered in the commercial register of Celesio at the local court of Stuttgart, Germany on December 2, 2014 following the approval for registration by the Stuttgart Higher Regional Court, the outcome of the Main Proceedings will not impact the effectiveness of the Domination Agreement and thus will not impact McKessons ability to direct the activities of Celesio. The court is scheduled to issue a decision on the Main Proceedings on June 16, 2015.Fiscal 2013On February22, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of PSS World Medical, Inc. PSSIof Jacksonville, Florida for $2900per share plus the assumption of PSSIs debt, or approximately $19 billionin aggregate, consisting of cash consideration of $13 billion, net of cash acquired, and the assumption of long-term debt with a fair value of $06 billion. The cash paid at acquisition was funded from cash on hand and the issuance of long-term debt. PSSI markets and distributes medical products and services throughout the United States.The acquisition of PSSI expanded our existing Medical-Surgical business.Included in the purchase price allocation are acquired identifiable intangibles of $568 million, the fair value of which was primarily determined by applying the income approach, using several significant unobservable inputs for projected cash flows and a discount rate. These inputs are considered Level 3 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance.The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets of approximately $1,149 millionwas recorded as goodwill, which primarily reflects the expected future benefits to be realized upon integrating the business. Most of the goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.Financial results for PSSI since the acquisition date are included in the results of operations within our MedicalSurgical distributions and services business, which is part of our Distribution Solutions segment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013.On April6, 2012, wepurchased the remaining 50%ownership interest in ourcorporate headquarters building located in San Francisco, California, for $90 million, which was funded from cash on hand. Wepreviously held a 50%ownership interest and were the primary tenant in this building. This transaction was accounted for as a step acquisition, which required that we remeasure our previously held50%ownership interest to fair value and record the difference between the fair value and carrying value as a gain in the consolidated statements of operations. The re-measurement to fair value resulted in a non-cash pre-tax gain of  which was recorded as a gain on business combination within Corporate in the consolidated statements of operations during the first quarter of 2013. The total fair value of the net assets acquired was $180 million, which was allocated as follows: building and improvements of $113 millionand land of $58 millionwith the remainder allocated for settlement of our pre-existing lease and lease intangible assets.Other AcquisitionsDuring the last three years, we also completed a number of other smaller acquisitions within both of our operating segments. Financial results for our business acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates. Purchase prices for our business acquisitions have been allocated based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.Goodwill recognized for our business acquisitions is generally not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. However, if we acquire the assets of a company, the goodwill may be deductible for tax purposes68Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES Continued3.Noncontrolling InterestsAt March 31, 2014, we owned approximately 754%of Celesios outstanding and fully diluted common shares and the noncontrolling interests in Celesio were presented within the permanent equity section of our consolidated balance sheet. In April 2014, we completed a tender offer and paid $32 millionin cash to acquire approximately 1 millionadditional common shares of Celesio at 2350per share, which increased our ownership share by 05%and decreased noncontrolling interests by $35 million. On December 2, 2014, the Domination Agreement between Celesio and McKesson, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, McKesson Deutschland, became effective as previously discussed in Financial Note 2, Business Combinations. Prior to the effectiveness of the Domination Agreement, the net income or loss from Celesio was attributed to the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio based on their proportionate ownership interest in Celesio. Upon the effectiveness of the Domination Agreement, McKesson became obligated to pay the $50 millionGuaranteed Dividend to the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio in relation to Celesios fiscal year ended December31, 2014. Under the Domination Agreement, McKesson also became obligated to pay the annual recurring Compensation Amount of 083per Celesio share effective January 1, 2015. The Compensation Amount is recognized ratably during the applicable annual period. As a result, during 2015, we recorded a total attribution of net income to the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio of $62 million. All amounts were recorded in our consolidated statement of operations within the caption, Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests, and the corresponding liability balance was recorded within other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.In addition, upon effectiveness of the Domination Agreement, the noncontrolling interests in Celesio became redeemable as a result of a put right. Accordingly, the carrying value of noncontrolling interests related to Celesio of $15 billionwas reclassified from Total Equity to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests on our consolidated balance sheet. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we paid $8 millionto purchase 03 millionshares of Celesio through the exercise of the put right by the noncontrolling shareholders, which decreased the carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests by $9 million. The balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date. The redemption value is the Put Amount adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations each period. At March 31, 2015, the carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests of $14 billionexceeded the maximum redemption value of $12 billion. At March 31, 2015, we owned approximately 760%of Celesios outstanding common shares.Changes in noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests were as follows:In  March 31, 2014$1,796$Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 1562Other comprehensive loss174105Purchase of noncontrolling  from Total Equity to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  of guaranteed dividends and recurring compensation to other accrued  March 31, 2015$84$1,3861Includes the Guaranteed Dividend of $50 millionfor Celesios fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 and the Compensation Amount of $12 millionfor the fourth quarter of 20152Includes net foreign currency losses of $138 millionattributable to noncontrolling interestsThe effect of changes in our ownership interests with noncontrolling interests on our equity of $2 millionwas recorded as a net decrease to McKessons stockholders paid-in capital during 2015. Net income attributable to McKesson and transfers from noncontrolling interests amounted to $1,474 millionduring 201569Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES Continued4.Discontinued OperationsDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we committed to a plan to sell our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business and a small business from our Distribution Solutions segment, as well as a small business from our Technology Solutions segment. We acquired the Brazilian distribution business through our February 2014 acquisition of Celesio.In 2014, we committed to a plan to sell our International Technology and our Hospital Automation businesses from our Technology Solutions segment and certain businesses from our Distribution Solutions segment. During the first quarter of 2015, we decided to retain the workforce business within our International Technology business. This business consists of workforce management solutions for the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, which we will transition to another service provider during the first quarter of 2016. As a result, the workforce business, which had been designated as a discontinued operation since the first quarter of 2014, was reclassified to continuing operations in the first quarter of 2015. During the first quarter of 2015, we also recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of $34 million$27 millionafter-tax primarily relating to depreciation and amortization expense for the period in 2014 while the business was classified as held for sale. The non-cash charge was recorded in our consolidated statement of operations primarily in cost of sales.As required, we classified the results of operations and cash flows of these businesses as discontinued operations for all applicable periods presented in our consolidated financial statements. Depreciation and amortization expense is not recognized from the date the businesses are classified as held for sale.A summary of results of discontinued operations is as follows: Years Ended March 31,In  from discontinued  on sale65Loss from discontinued operations before income tax32718232Income tax benefit28267Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax$299$156$25Fiscal 2015 During the second quarter of 2015, we completed the sale of a software business within our International Technology business and recorded a pre-tax and after-tax loss of $6 million.During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded $241 millionpre-tax $235 millionafter-tax non-cash impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of our Brazilian distribution business to its estimated fair value, less cost to sell. The impairment charge reduced the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, other long-lived assets and goodwill by $31 million. The remaining difference between the business fair value and carrying value of $210 millionwas recorded as a liability and was included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Cumulative foreign currency translation losses of $17 millionwere included in the assessment of this business carrying value for purposes of calculating the impairment charge. Cumulative foreign currency translation losses net of tax are included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on our consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2015. The ultimate loss from the sale may be higher or lower than our current assessment of the business fair value. 70Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedFiscal 2014During the third quarter of 2014, we sold our Hospital Automation business for net cash proceeds of $55 millionand recorded a pre-tax and after-tax loss of $5 millionand $7 million.During the third quarter of 2014, we recorded an $80 millionnon-cash pre-tax and after-tax impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our International Technology business to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. The impairment charge was primarily attributed to goodwill and other long-lived assets and as a result, there was no tax benefit associated with this charge. The assets and liabilities of our discontinued operations were classified as held-for-sale effective in 2014. All applicable assets of the businesses to be sold are included under the caption Prepaid expenses and other and all applicable liabilities under the caption Other accrued liabilities within our consolidated balance sheet at March31, 2015 and 2014. The carrying values of the assets and liabilities classified as held-for-sale were $660 millionand $663 millionat March31, 2015. 5.Asset Impairments and Product Alignment ChargesIn 2014 and 2013, we recorded asset impairments and product alignment charges of $57 millionand $46millionin our Technology Solutions segment. Fiscal 2014During the third quarter of 2014, our Technology Solutions segment recorded pre-tax charges totaling $57 million. These charges primarily consist of $35 millionof product alignment charges, $15 millionof integration-related expenses and $7 millionof reduction-in-workforce severance charges. Included in the total charge was $35 millionfor severance for employees primarily in our research and development, customer services and sales functions, and $15 millionfor asset impairments which primarily represents the write-off of deferred costs related to a product that will no longer be developed. Charges were recorded in our consolidated statement of operations as follows: $34 millionin cost of sales and $23 millionin operating expenses.Fiscal 2013During the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded $46 millionof non-cash pre-tax impairment charges. These charges were the result of a significant decrease in estimated revenues for a software product. The charge included a $36 milliongoodwill impairment to reduce the carrying value of goodwill within the applicable reporting unit to its implied fair value. In addition, the goodwill had a nominal tax basis. This impairment charge was recorded in operating expenses within our consolidated statement of operations. Refer to Financial Note 20, Fair Value Measurements, for more information on this nonrecurring fair value measurement. The balance of the charge also represents a $10 millionimpairment to reduce the carrying value of the unamortized capitalized software held for sale costs for this product to its net realizable value. We concluded that the estimated future undiscounted revenues, net of estimated related costs, were insufficient to recover its carrying value. This impairment charge was recorded in cost of sales within our consolidated statement of operations. 6.Equity InvestmentsWe own a 45%interest in Brocacef Holding N.V. Brocacef, which provides, through its subsidiaries, wholesale distribution services and supplies pharmaceutical and other healthcare products to pharmacies, retailers and hospitals in the Netherlands. During the third quarter of 2015, we announced that Brocacef intends to purchase Mediq Apotheken Beheer B.V., which owns and operates pharmacies in the Netherlands. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory clearances and approval of the relevant competition authorities but is expected to close during the first half of 2016.During 2013, we committed to a plan to sell our 49%equity interest in Nadro, S.A. de C.V. Nadro and in the fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $191 millionreducing the investments carrying value to its estimated fair value. Cumulative foreign currency translation losses of $69 millionwere included in the assessment of the investments carrying value for purposes of calculating the impairment charge. The impairment charge was recorded in impairment of an equity investment in the consolidated statements of operations within our Distribution Solutions segment71Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedIn September 2013, we completed the sale of our 49%equity interest in Nadro. Under the terms of the agreement, we received $41 millionin total cash consideration. There was no material gain or loss on the disposition based on the adjusted fair value of the investment at the time of the sale. Prior to the sale, our investment in Nadro was accounted for under the equity method of accounting within our Distribution Solutions segment. 7.Share-Based CompensationWe provide share-based compensation to our employees, officers and non-employee directors, including stock options, an employee stock purchase plan, restricted stock units RSUs, performance-based restricted stock units PeRSUs and total shareholder return units TSRUs collectively, share-based awards. Most of our share-based awards are granted in the first quarter of each fiscal year. Compensation expense for the share-based awards is recognized for the portion of awards ultimately expected to vest. We estimate the number of share-based awards that will ultimately vest primarily based on historical experience. The estimated forfeiture rate established upon grant is re-assessed throughout the requisite service period and is adjusted when actual forfeitures occur. The actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than current estimates. The compensation expense recognized has been classified in the consolidated statements of operations or capitalized in the consolidated balance sheets in the same manner as cash compensation paid to our employees. There was no material share-based compensation expense capitalized as part of the cost of an asset in 2015, 2014and 2013.Impact on Net IncomeThe components of share-based compensation expense and related tax benefits are as follows:Years Ended March 31, In  stock unit awards1$137$126$132Stock options242224Employee stock purchase plan131211Share-based compensation expense174160167Tax benefit for share-based compensation expense 2615559Share-based compensation expense, net of tax$113$105$1081Includes compensation expense recognized for RSUs, PeRSUs and TSRUs. Our TSRUs were awarded beginning in 20152Income tax benefit is computed using the tax rates of applicable tax jurisdictions. Additionally, a portion of pre-tax compensation expense is not tax-deductible. Stock PlansIn July 2013, our stockholders approved the 2013 Stock Plan to replace the 2005 Stock Plan. These stock plans provide our employees, officers and non-employee directors the opportunity to receive equity-based, long-term incentives in the form of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, PeRSUs, TSRUs and other share-based awards. The 2013 Stock Plan reserves 30millionshares plus the remaining number of shares reserved but unused under the 2005 Stock Plan. As of March31, 2015, 30 millionshares remain available for future grant under the 2013 Stock Plan72Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedStock OptionsStock options are granted with an exercise price at no less than the fair market value and those options granted under the stock plans generally have a contractual term of sevenyears and follow a four-year vesting schedule.Compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and is based on the grant-date fair value for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest. We use the Black-Scholes options-pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options. Once the fair value of an employee stock option is determined, current accounting practices do not permit it to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from actual. The options-pricing model requires the use of various estimates and assumptions as follows:Expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our common stock and implied market volatility. We believe that this market-based input provides a reasonable estimate of our future stock price movements and is consistent with employee stock option valuation considerations.Expected dividend yield is based on historical experience and investors current expectations.The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the constant maturity U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the time of grant.Expected life of the options is based primarily on historical employee stock option exercises and other behavior data and reflects the impact of changes in contractual life of current option grants compared to our historical grants.Weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of employee stock options were as follows:Years Ended March 31, 201520142013Expected stock price volatility22%22%27%Expected dividend yield06%07%09%Risk-free interest rate13%07%08%Expected life in years445The following is a summary of stock options outstanding at March31, 2015:Options OutstandingOptions ExercisableRange of ExercisePricesNumber ofOptionsOutstandingat Year EndIn   PriceNumber ofOptionsExercisable atYear EndIn   of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedThe following table summarizes stock option activity during 2015:In millions, except per share  YearsAggregateIntrinsic Value2Outstanding, March 31,  March 31, 20155$95014$539Vested and expected to vest15$95014$538Vested and exercisable, March 31, 20152692733631The number of options expected to vest takes into account an estimate of expected forfeitures2The intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the period-end market price of the Companys common stock and the exercise price of in-the-money options.

Total compensation expense for RSUs under our stock plans is determined by the product of the number of shares that are expected to vest and the grant date market price of the Companys common stock. The Compensation Committee determines the vesting terms at the time of grant. These awards generally vest in threeto fouryears. We recognize expense for RSUs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.Non-employee directors receive an annual grant of RSUs, which vest immediately and are expensed upon grant. The director may elect to receive the underlying shares immediately or defer receipt of the shares if they meet director stock ownership guidelines. The shares will be automatically deferred for those directors who do not meet the director stock ownership guidelines. At March31,2015, approximately 158,000RSUs for our directors are vested74Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedPeRSUs are RSUs for which the number of RSUs awarded is conditional upon the attainment of one or more performance objectives over a specified period. Each year, the Compensation Committee approves the target number of PeRSUs representing the base number of awards that could be granted if performance goals are attained. PeRSUs are accounted for as variable awards until the performance goals are reached at which time the grant date is established. Total compensation expense for PeRSUs is determined by the product of the number of shares eligible to be awarded and expected to vest, and the market price of the Companys common stock, commencing at the inception of the requisite service period. During the performance period, the compensation expense for PeRSUs is re-computed using the market price and the performance modifier at the end of a reporting period. At the end of the performance period, if the goals are attained, the awards are granted and classified as RSUs and accounted for on that basis. We recognize compensation expense for these awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite aggregate service period of generally fouryears.TSRUs replace PeRSUs for our executive officers beginning in 2015. The number of vested TSRUs is assessed at the end of a three-year performance period and is conditioned upon attainment of a total shareholder return metric relative to a peer group of companies. We use the Monte Carlo simulation model to measure the fair value of TSRUs. TSRUs have a requisite service period of approximately 3 years. For TSRUs that are designated as equity awards, the fair value is measured at the grant date and expense is attributed to the requisite service period on a straight-line basis. For TSRUs that are eligible for cash settlement and designated as liability awards, we measure the fair value at the end of each reporting period and expense is recognized for services rendered based on the adjusted fair value of the awards. The weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of TSRUs included expected dividend yield of 05%, risk-free interest rate of 07%, expected stock volatility of 213%and contractual term of 3 years.The following table summarizes restricted stock unit award activity during 2015:In millions, except per share  Date FairValue Per ShareNonvested, March 31,  March 31, 20154$12957The following table provides data related to restricted stock unit award activity: Years Ended March 31, In millions201520142013Total fair value of shares vested$126$184$66Total compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested restricted stock unit awards not yet recognized,  period in years over which restricted stock unit award cost is expected to be recognized222Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPPThe Company has an ESPP under which 21 millionshares have been authorized for issuance. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock through payroll deductions. The deductions occur over three-month purchase periods and the shares are then purchased at 85%of the market price at the end of each purchase period. Employees are allowed to terminate their participation in the ESPP at any time during the purchase period prior to the purchase of the shares. The 15%discount provided to employees on these shares is included in compensation expense. The shares related to funds outstanding at the end of a quarter are included in the calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding. These amounts have not been significant. Shares issued under the ESPP were not material in 2015and 2014and 1 millionin 2013.

Our discrete tax expense for 2014 is primarily related to a $122 millioncharge regarding an unfavorable decision from the Tax Court of Canada with respect to transfer pricing issues. The 2013 federal and state current income tax expense reflects the utilization of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards76Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedWe have received reassessments from the Canada Revenue Agency CRA related to a transfer pricing matter impacting years 2003 through 2010, and have filed Notices of Appeal to the Tax Court of Canada for all of these years. On December13,2013, the Tax Court of Canada dismissed our appeal of the 2003 reassessment and we have filed a Notice of Appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal regarding this tax year. After the close of 2015, we reached an agreement in principle with the CRA to settle the transfer pricing matter for years 2003 through 2010. Since the agreement in principle did not occur within 2015, we have not reflected this potential settlement in our 2015 financial statements. We will record the final settlement amount in a subsequent quarter and do not expect it to have a material impact to income tax expense.During 2015, we reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service IRS to settle all outstanding issues relating to years 2003 through 2006 and recognized discrete tax benefits of $55 millionto record previously unrecognized tax benefits and related interest.The IRS has been examining our U.S. corporation income tax returns for 2007 through 2009. We anticipate that they will issue a Revenue Agent Report in 2016 to disclose the results of their audit and any proposed assessments. The CRA is currently examining our Canadian income tax returns for years 2011 through 2013.  In nearly all jurisdictions, the tax years prior to 2003 are no longer subject to examination. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and evaluating income tax uncertainties. Although our major taxing jurisdictions are the U.S. and Canada, we are subject to income taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax liabilities reflect managements best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties.The reconciliation between our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations and statutory tax rate is as follows:Years Ended March 31, In millions201520142013Income tax expense at federal statutory rate$930$760$683State income taxes net of federal tax benefit815758Foreign income taxed at various rates247177143Canadian litigation122Controlled substance distribution reserve58Unrecognized tax benefits and settlements1061Tax credits10613Other, net771Income tax expense$815$757$587At March31, 2015, undistributed earnings of our foreign operations totaling $4,916 millionwere considered to be permanently reinvested. Nodeferred tax liability has been recognized on the basis difference created by such earnings since it is our intention to utilize those earnings in the foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite period of time. The determination of the amount of deferred taxes on these earnings is not practicable because the computation would depend on a number of factors that cannot be known until a decision to repatriate the earnings is made77Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedDeferred tax balances consisted of the following: March 31, In  allowances$83$94Deferred revenue72136Compensation and benefit related accruals681632Net operating loss and credit  valuation allowance229200Total  valuation and other assets2,3332,161Fixed assets and systems development  liabilities3,7914,075Net deferred tax  net deferred tax asset$26$42Current net deferred tax  deferred tax asset5019Long-term deferred tax liability8591,262Net deferred tax liability$2,602$2,789We assess the available positive and negative evidence to determine whether deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. As a result of this assessment, valuation allowances have been recorded on certain deferred tax assets in various tax jurisdictions. The increase in valuation allowances in the current year relate primarily to net operating losses incurred in certain tax jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was recognized.We have federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $44 million, $1,930 millionand $711million. The federal and state net operating losses will expire at various dates from 2016 through 2035. Substantially all of our foreign net operating losses have indefinite lives.The following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits for the last three years:Years Ended March 31, In  tax benefits at beginning of period$647$560$595Additions based on tax positions related to prior years6210646Reductions based on tax positions related to prior years1823106Additions based on tax positions related to current year272331Reductions based on  based on the lapse of the applicable statutes of limitations1272Exchange rate  tax benefits at end of period$616$647$56078Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedOf the total $616 millionin unrecognized tax benefits at March31, 2015, $457 millionwould reduce income tax expense and the effective tax rate if recognized. During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that audit resolutions and the expiration of statutes of limitations could potentially reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by up to $137 million. However, this amount may change because we continue to have ongoing negotiations with various taxing authorities throughout the year.We report interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. In 2015 and 2014, we recognized an income tax benefit of $24 millionand income tax expense of $48 millionrelated to interest and penalties in our consolidated statements of operations. The income tax benefit for interest and penalties recognized in 2015 was primarily due to the lapses of statutes of limitations. The income tax expense for interest and penalties recognized in 2014 was primarily due to the additional interest resulting from the increase of our Canadian gross unrecognized tax benefits. At March31,2015and 2014, we had $122millionand $179millionaccrued for the payment of interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits. 10.Earnings Per Common ShareBasic earnings per common share attributable to McKesson are computed by dividing net income attributable to McKesson by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per common share are computed similar to basic earnings per common share except that it reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities or other obligations to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.

These evaluations are highly complex and involve judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical information and managements judgment, among other factors. Based on our evaluations, if we determine we are the primary beneficiary of such VIEs, we consolidate such entities into our financial statements. Consolidated Variable Interest EntitiesWe consolidate VIEs when we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE and, as a result, are considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. We consolidate certain single-lessee leasing entities where we, as the lessee, have the majority risk of the leased assets due to our minimum lease payment obligations to these leasing entities. As a result of absorbing this risk, the leases provide us with the power to direct the operations of the leased properties and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entity. Consolidated VIEs have an immaterial impact on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows. Total assets and liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet for these VIEs were $144 millionand $51 millionat March 31, 2015 and $160 millionand $75 millionat March 31, 2014.Investments in Unconsolidated Variable Interest EntitiesWe are involved with VIEs which we do not consolidate because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance and thus are not considered the primary beneficiary of the entities. Our relationships include equity investments and lending, leasing, contractual or other relationships with the VIEs. Our most significant relationships are with oncology and other specialty practices. Under these practice arrangements, we generally own or lease all of the real estate and equipment used by the affiliated practices and manage the practices administrative functions. We also have relationships with certain pharmacies in Europe with whom we may provide financing, have equity ownership and/or a supply agreement whereby we supply the vast majority of the pharmacies purchases. Our maximum exposure to loss regardless of probability as a result of all unconsolidated VIEs was $12 billionat March31, 2015and 2014, which primarily represents the value of intangible assets related to service agreements and lease and loan receivables. These amounts exclude the customer loan guarantees discussed in Financial Note 22, Financial Guarantees and Warranties. We believe that there is no material loss exposure on these assets or from these relationships85Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES Continued17.Pension BenefitsWe maintain a number of qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for eligible employees.Defined Benefit Pension PlansEligible U.S. employees who were employed by the Company as of December 31, 1995 are covered under the Company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plan. In 1997, the plan was amended to freeze all plan benefits as of December 31, 1996. Benefits for the defined benefit retirement plan are based primarily on age of employees at date of retirement, years of creditable service and the average of the highest 60 monthsof pay during the 15 yearsprior to the plan freeze date. We also have defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees outside of the U.S., as well as an unfunded nonqualified supplemental defined benefit plan for certain U.S. executives.Our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans cover eligible employees located predominantly in Norway, United Kingdom and Germany. Benefits for these plans are based primarily on each employees final salary, with annual adjustments for inflation. The obligations in Norway are largely related to the state-regulated pension plan which is managed by the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund SPK. According to the terms of the SPK, the plan assets of state regulated plans in Norway must correspond very closely to the pension obligation calculated using the principles codified in Norwegian law. The shortfall may not exceed 1%of the obligation. If the shortfall exceeds this threshold, it must be remedied within twoyears. In the United Kingdom, we have subsidiaries that participate in a joint pension plan. This plan is largely funded by contractual trust arrangements that hold Company assets that may only be used to pay pension obligations. The Trustee Board decides on the minimum contribution to the plan in association with selected employees of the entity. A valuation is performed at regular intervals in order to determine the amount of the contribution and to ensure that the minimum contribution is made. The pension obligation in Germany is unfunded with the exception of the contractual trust arrangement used to fund pensions of Celesios Management Board.Defined benefit plan assets and obligations are measured as of the Companys fiscal year-end. The net periodic expense for our pension plans, which includes net pension expense of Celesio beginning February 2014, is as follows:U.S. PlansNon-U.S. PlansYears Ended March 31, Years Ended March 31, In  cost - benefits earned during the year$1$4$4$16$6$3Interest cost on projected benefit obligation19192134117Expected return on  of unrecognized actuarial loss, prior service costs and net transitional  loss gain61Net periodic pension expense$18$35$33$29$8$6The projected unit credit method is utilized in measuring net periodic pension expense over the employees service life for the pension plans.

Pension obligations for our unfunded plans are based on the recommendations of independent actuaries. Projected benefit obligations relating to our unfunded non-U.S. plans were $222 millionand $260 millionat March 31, 2015 and 2014. Funding obligations for our non-U.S. plans vary based on the laws of each non-U.S. jurisdiction.Expected benefit payments, including assumed executive lump sum payments, for our pension plans are as follows: $74million, $172 million, $75 million, $94 millionand $66 millionfor 2016to 2020and $333 millionfor 2021through 2025. Expected benefit payments are based on the same assumptions used to measure the benefit obligations and include estimated future employee service. Expected contributions to be made for our pension plans are $54 millionfor 2016.Weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the net periodic pension expense and the actuarial present value of benefit obligations were as follows:U.S. PlansNon-U.S. PlansYears Ended March 31, Years Ended March 31, 201520142013201520142013Net periodic pension expenseDiscount  of increase in  long-term rate of return on plan  obligationDiscount  of increase in  of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedOur defined benefit pension plan liabilities are valued using a discount rate based on a yield curve developed from a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds rated AA or better whose maturities are aligned with the expected benefit payments of our plans.

S. pension plan assets is to generate long-term investment returns consistent with capital preservation and prudent investment practices, with a diversification of asset types and investment strategies. Periodic adjustments are made to provide liquidity for benefit payments and to rebalance plan assets to their target allocations.The target allocations for U.S. plan assets at March31, 2015and 2014 are 50%equity investments, 45%fixed income investments including cash and cash equivalents and 5%real estate. Equity investments include common stock, preferred stock, and equity commingled funds. Fixed income investments include corporate bonds, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, other directly held fixed income investments, and fixed income commingled funds. The real estate investment is in a commingled real estate fund. For both U.S. and non-U.S. plan assets, the investment strategies are subject to local regulations and the asset/liability profiles of the plans in each individual country. Plan assets of the non-U.S. plans are broadly invested in a manner appropriate to the nature and duration of the expected future retirement benefits payable under the plans. Plan assets are primarily invested in high-quality corporate and government bond funds and equity securities. Assets are properly diversified to avoid excessive reliance on any particular asset, issuer or group of undertakings so as to avoid accumulations of risk in the portfolio as a whole.We develop the expected long-term rate of return assumption based on the projected performance of the asset classes in which plan assets are invested. The target asset allocation was determined based on the liability and risk tolerance characteristics of the plans and at times may be adjusted to achieve overall investment objectives.Fair Value Measurements: The following tables represent our pension plan assets as of March31, 2015and 2014, using the fair value hierarchy by asset class. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. 89Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedU.S. PlansNon-U.S. PlansMarch31, 2015March31, 2015In millionsLevel 1Level 2Level 3TotalLevel 1Level 2Level 3TotalCash and cash  securities:Common and preferred stock1818Equity commingled funds1381387149156Fixed income securities:Government securities1414265379Corporate bonds14141313Mortgage-backed securities1414Asset-backed securities and other2626Fixed income commingled funds64127191Other:Real estate funds18182626Other commingled  PlansNon-U.S. PlansMarch31, 2014March31, 2014In millionsLevel 1Level 2Level 3TotalLevel 1Level 2Level 3TotalCash and cash equivalents$8 8$7 7Equity securities:Common and preferred stock1919Equity commingled funds1321326157163Fixed income securities:Government securities7744Corporate  securities1010Asset-backed securities and other2222Fixed income commingled funds63634545Other:Real estate funds161619726Other commingled   pending trades at March31, 2014. 90Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedCash and cash equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investment funds that maintain daily liquidity and aim to have constant unit values of $100. The funds invest in short-term fixed income securities and other securities with debt-like characteristics emphasizing short-term maturities and high credit quality. Directly held cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 investments. Cash and cash equivalents include money market funds and other commingled funds, which have daily net asset values derived from the underlying securities; these are classified as Level 1 investments.Common and preferred stock - This investment class consists of common and preferred shares issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations. Common shares are traded actively on exchanges and price quotes are readily available. Preferred shares may not be actively traded. Holdings of common shares are generally classified as Level 1 investments. Preferred shares are classified as Level 2 investments.Equity commingled funds - Some equity investments are held in commingled funds, which have daily net asset values derived from quoted prices for the underlying securities in active markets; these are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 investments.Fixed income securities - Government securities consist of bonds and debentures issued by central governments or federal agencies; corporate bonds consist of bonds and debentures issued by corporations; mortgage-backed securities consist of debt obligations secured by a mortgage or pool of mortgages; and asset-backed securities primarily consist of debt obligations secured by an asset or pool of assets other than mortgages. Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset. Multiple prices and price types are obtained from pricing vendors whenever possible, enabling cross-provider price validations. Fixed income securities are generally classified as Level 1 or Level 2 investments.Fixed income commingled funds - Some fixed income investments are held in exchange traded or commingled funds, which have daily net asset values derived from the underlying securities; these are classified as Level 1 or 2 investments. Real estate funds - The value of the real estate funds is reported by the fund manager and is based on a valuation of the underlying properties. Inputs used in the valuation include items such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. The real estate funds are classified as Level 3 investments.Other commingled funds - The other commingled funds are invested in equities, bonds, commodities, other alternative investments and cash and cash equivalents. These funds are valued based on the weekly net asset values derived from the quoted prices for the underlying securities in active markets and, for alternative investments, based on other valuation techniques. Other commingled funds are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 investments.Other - At March 31, 2015, this includes $39 millionof plan asset value relating to the SPK. In principle, the SPK is organized as a pay-as-you-go system guaranteed by the Norwegian government as it holds no Company-owned assets to back the pension liabilities. The Company pays a pension premium used to fund the plan, which is paid directly to the Norwegian government who establishes an account for each participating employer to keep track of the financial status of the plan, including managing the contributions and the payments. Further, the investment return credited to this account is determined annually by the SPK based on the performance of long-term government bonds91Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedThe following table represents a reconciliation of Level 3 plan assets held during the years ended March31, 2015and 2014:U.S. PlansNon-U.S. PlansIn millionsReal  at March 31,  gain on plan assets still held2211Purchases, sales and settlementsBalance at March 31,  gain on plan assets still held2211Purchases, sales and settlements18117Balance at March 31,  PlansThe Company contributes to a number of multiemployer pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover union-represented employees in the U.S. In 2015, we also contributed to the Pensjonsordningen for Apoteketaten POA, a mandatory multiemployer pension scheme for our pharmacy employees in Norway, managed by the association of Norwegian Pharmacies. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer pension plans in the following aspects: iassets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; iiif a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; and iiiif the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability. Actions taken by other participating employers may lead to adverse changes in the financial condition of a multiemployer benefit plan and our withdrawal liability and contributions may increase.Contributions and amounts accrued for U.S. Plans were not material for the years ended March31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.  Contributions to the POA for non-U.S. Plans exceeding 5%of total plan contributions were $24 millionand $5 millionin 2015 and 2014. Based on actuarial calculations, we estimate the funded status for our non-U.S. Plans to be approximately 65%as of March31, 2015. Noamounts were accrued for liability associated with the POA as we have no intention to withdraw from the plan.Defined Contribution PlansWe have a contributory profit sharing investment plan PSIP for U.S. eligible employees. Eligible employees may contribute to the PSIP up to 75%of their eligible compensation on a pre-tax or post-tax basis not to exceed IRS limits. The Company makes matching contributions in an amount equal to 100%of the employees first 3%of pay contributed and 50%for the next 2%of pay contributed. The Company also may make an additional annual matching contribution for each plan year to enable participants to receive a full match based on their annual contribution. The Company also contributed to non-U.S. plans that are available in certain countries. Contribution expenses for the PSIP and non-U.S. plans were $103 million, $83 millionand $65 millionfor the years ended March31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. 92Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES Continued18.Postretirement Benefits We maintain a number of postretirement benefits, primarily consisting of healthcare and life insurance welfare benefits, for certain eligible U.S. employees. Eligible employees consist of those who retired before March 31, 1999 and those who retired after March 31, 1999, but were an active employee as of that date, after meeting other age-related criteria. We also provide postretirement benefits for certain U.S. executives. Defined benefit plan obligations are measured as of the Companys fiscal year-end.The net periodic expense for our postretirement welfare benefits is as follows:Years Ended March 31, In millions201520142013Service cost - benefits earned during the year$1$2$2Interest cost on accumulated benefit obligation556Amortization of unrecognized actuarial gain and prior service credit412Curtailment gain2Net periodic postretirement expense$2$4$6Information regarding the changes in benefit obligations for our postretirement welfare plans is as follows: Years Ended March 31, In millions20152014Benefit obligation at beginning of period$119$131Service cost12Interest cost55Actuarial loss gain52Benefit payments1215Curtailment gain2Benefit obligation at end of period$118$119The components of the amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income for the Companys other postretirement benefits at March31, 2015and 2014were net actuarial losses of $1 millionand gains of $8 millionand net prior service credits of $1millionand $1 million. Other changes in benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income were net actuarial losses of $9 millionin 2015 and gains of $2 millionand $7 millionin 2014and 2013.We estimate that the amortization of the actuarial gain from stockholders equity to other postretirement expense in 2016will be $1 million. Comparable 2015amount was $4 million.Other postretirement benefits are funded as claims are paid. Expected benefit payments for our postretirement welfare benefit plans are as follows: $10 millionannually for 2016to 2020and $44 millioncumulatively for 2021through 2025. Expected benefit payments are based on the same assumptions used to measure the benefit obligations and include estimated future employee service. Expected contributions to be made for our postretirement welfare benefit plans are $10 millionfor 2016.Weighted-average discount rates used to estimate postretirement welfare benefit expenses were 407%, 384%and 444%for 2015, 2014and 2013. Weighted-average discount rates for the actuarial present value of benefit obligations were 361%, 408%and 384%for 2015, 2014and 2013.Actuarial gain or loss for the postretirement welfare benefit plan is amortized to income or expense over a three-year period. The assumed healthcare cost trends used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation were 675%and 700%for prescription drugs, 725/675%and 750/700%for ages pre-65/post-65medical and 500%for dental in 2015and 2014. For 2015, 2014and 2013, a one-percentage-point increase or decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would not have a material impact on the postretirement benefit obligations93Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedPursuant to various collective bargaining agreements, we contribute to multiemployer health and welfare plans that cover union-represented employees. Our liability is limited to the contractual dollar obligations set forth by the collective bargaining agreements. Contributions to the plans and amounts accrued were not material for the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014, and 201319.Hedging ActivitiesIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. At times, we limit these risks through the use of derivatives such as interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. In accordance with our policy, derivatives are only used for hedging purposes. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Foreign currency rate riskThe majority of our operations are conducted in U.S. dollars; however, certain assets and liabilities, revenues and expense and purchasing activities are incurred in and exposed to other currencies. We have certain foreign currency rate risk programs that manage the impact of foreign currency fluctuation. These programs are utilized on a transactional basis when we consider there to be a risk in fair value or volatility in cash flows. These programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign currency rate risk. At March 31, 2015 and 2014, forward contracts to hedge the U.S. dollar against cash flows denominated in Canadian dollars with total notional values of $399 millionand $463 millionwere designated for hedge accounting. These contracts will mature between March 2016and March 2020. Changes in the fair valuesfor contracts designated for hedge accounting are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings; losses reclassified into earnings for contracts designated for hedge accounting were not material in 2015, 2014 and 2013. We also have a number of forward contracts to primarily hedge the Euro against cash flows denominated in British pounds and other European currencies. At March 31, 2015 and 2014, the total notional value of these contracts was $1,755millionand $1,091 million. These contracts will mature from April 2015to February 2016and none of these contracts were designated for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair values for contracts not designated for hedge accounting are recorded directly to earnings and accordingly, net losses from the changes in the fair value of these contracts of $189 millionwere recorded within operating expenses in 2015 and were not material in 2014. However, the losses from these contracts are largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying intercompany foreign currency loans.Interest rate riskFrom time to time, we have entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with variable rate debt. Interest rate swaps are used to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the variable rate debt to achieve primarily fixed rate interest expense. The interest rate swap transactions generally involve the exchange of floating or fixed interest payments. Our interest rate swaps that were outstanding at March 31, 2014 all matured during the first half of 2015. These contracts were not designated for hedge accounting and, accordingly, changes in the fair value of these swaps were recorded directly in earnings. At March 31, 2014, the total gross notional value of these contracts was $96 million. Amounts recorded to earnings were not material for 2015 and 201494Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedInformation regarding the fair value of derivatives on a gross basis is as follows:Balance Sheet CaptionMarch 31, 2015March 31, 2014Fair Value of DerivativeU.S. Dollar NotionalFair Value of DerivativeU.S Dollar NotionalIn  designated for hedge accountingForeign exchangecontracts currentPrepaid expenses and other$14$$76$4$$64Foreign exchangecontracts non-currentOther  not designated for hedge accountingForeign exchangecontracts currentPrepaid expenses and other$7$$493$2$$255Foreign exchangecontracts currentOther accrued  rate swap contracts currentOther accrued  to Financial Note 20, Fair Value Measurements, for more information on these recurring fair value measurements.  20. Fair Value MeasurementsFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The analysis of fair value is conducted by our accounting and finance personnel who organizationally report to the Chief Financial Officer. There is a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in determining fair value by their reliability and preferred use, as follows:Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. At March31, 2015and 2014, the carrying amounts of cash, certain cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings and other current liabilities approximated their estimated fair values because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. 95Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedOur long-term debt and other financing arrangements are carried at amortized cost. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of these liabilities were $97 billionand $104 billionat March31, 2015and $103 billionand $107 billionat March31,2014. The estimated fair values of our long-term debt and other financing were determined using quoted market prices in a less active market and other observable inputs from available market information, which are considered to be Level 2 inputs, and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future.Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisOur financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of the following:March31, 2015March31, 2014In millionsLevel 1Level 2Level 3TotalLevel 1Level 2Level 3TotalCash EquivalentsMoney market funds  deposits 294941212Repurchase agreements 21,2431,243569569Total cash  Gross unrealized gain and losses were not material for the years ended March 31, 2015and 2014based on quoted prices of identical investments2 The carrying amounts of these cash equivalents approximated their estimated fair values because of their short maturities.Fair values of our marketable securities were determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets, which are considered Level 1 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance. Fair values for our marketable securities were not material at March 31, 2015 and 2014.Fair values of our forward foreign currency derivatives were determined using quoted market prices of similar instruments in an active market and other observable inputs from available market information. These inputs are considered Level 2 under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance, and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future. Refer to Financial Note 19, Hedging Activities, for more information on our forward foreign currency derivatives.There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended March 31,2015and 2014. Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring BasisWe measure certain long-lived assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, our intent to hold the investment, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and the financial outlook for the industry and location. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the asset exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary. 96Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedFiscal 2015As discussed in Financial Note 4, Discontinued Operations, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a $241 millionpre-tax $235 millionafter-tax non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our Brazilian distribution business to its estimated fair value, less cost to sell. The fair value of this business was determined using income and market valuation approaches. Under the income approach, we used a discounted cash flow DCF analysis based on the estimated future results. This valuation approach is considered a Level3 fair value measurement due to the use of significant unobservable inputs related to the timing and amount of future cash flows based on projections of revenues and operating costs and discounting those cash flows to their present value. The key inputs and assumptions of the DCF method are the projected cash flows, the terminal value of the business and the discount rate. Under the market approach, we apply valuation multiples of reasonably similar publicly traded companies to the operating data of the subject business to derive the estimated fair value.  This valuation approach is also considered a Level 3 fair value measurement. The key inputs for the market valuation approach were revenues and a selection of market multiples. The ultimate loss from the sale of the business may be higher or lower than our current assessment of the business fair value.Fiscal 2014As discussed in Financial Note 4, Discontinued Operations, during 2014, we recorded an $80 millionnon-cash pre-tax and after-tax impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our International Technology business to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. The impairment charge was primarily the result of the terms of the preliminary purchase offers received for this business during 2014. Accordingly, the fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Fiscal 2013As discussed in Financial Note 6, Equity Investments, during 2013, we committed to a plan to sell our investment in Nadro and, in the fourth quarter of 2013, recorded an impairment charge of $191million to reduce the carrying value to fair value. The fair value of our investment in Nadro was determined using income and market valuation approaches. Under the income approach, we used a discounted cash flow DCF analysis based on estimated future results. This valuation approach is considered a Level3 fair value measurement. The key inputs for the market valuation approach were Nadros fiscal 2012 unaudited earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization EBITDA and an EBITDA multiple based on similar guideline U.S. pharmaceutical companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. This valuation approach is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement. Finally, we evaluated the fair values under both valuation methods and concluded on an average of the two methods. In September 2013, we completed the sale of our 49%interest in Nadro which resulted in no material gain or loss.As discussed in Financial Note 5, Asset Impairments and Product Alignment Charges, in 2013, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $36million in one of Technology Solutions segments reporting units. The impairment charge was primarily the result of a significant decrease in estimated revenues for a software product. As required under step two of goodwill impairment testing, we determined the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting units net assets, excluding goodwill but including any unrecognized intangible assets. The implied fair value of goodwill was then calculated on a residual basis that is, by subtracting the sum of the fair value of the net assets from the fair value of the reporting unit. The impairment was equal to the carrying amount of goodwill. Fair value assessment of the reporting unit as well as the reporting units net assets are considered a Level 3 measurement due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company specific information. We used the market approach and income approach DCF model to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and a DCF model to determine the fair value of the reporting units most significant assets intangibles97Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES Continued21.Lease ObligationsWe lease facilities and equipment almost solely under operating leases. At March31, 2015, future minimum lease payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year for years ending March 31 are:In  minimum lease payments 1$1,7661Minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $46million due under future noncancelable subleases. Rental expense under operating leases was $440 million, $298 millionand $232 millionin 2015, 2014and 2013. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, taking into account, when applicable, lessor incentives for tenant improvements, periods where no rent payment is required and escalations in rent payments over the term of the lease. Deferred rent is recognized for the difference between the rent expense recognized on a straight-line basis and the payments made per the terms of the lease. Remaining terms for facilities leases generally range from oneto twelveyears, while remaining terms for equipment leases range from oneto fiveyears. Most real property leases contain renewal options generally for five-year increments and provisions requiring us to pay property taxes and operating expenses in excess of base period amounts. Sublease rental income was not material for 2015, 2014and 2013. 22.Financial Guarantees and WarrantiesFinancial GuaranteesWe have agreements with certain of our customers financial institutions, mainly in Canada and Europe, under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of our customers inventory or our customers debt in the event these customers are unable to meet their obligations to those financial institutions. For our inventory repurchase agreements, among other requirements, inventories must be in resalable condition and any repurchase would be at a discount. The inventory repurchase agreements mostly relate to certain Canadian customers and generally range from oneto twoyears. Customers debt guarantees range from oneto fifteenyears and are primarily provided to facilitate financing for certain customers. The majority of our customers debt guarantees are secured by certain assets of the customer. At March31, 2015, the maximum amounts of inventory repurchase guarantees and customers debt guarantees were $185 millionand $183 million, of which $1 millionhad been accrued. The expirations of these financial guarantees are as follows: $137 million, $42 million, $16 million, $21 millionand $25 millionfrom 2016through 2020and $127millionthereafter.At March31, 2015, our banks and insurance companies have issued $142 millionof standby letters of credit and surety bonds, which were issued on our behalf mostly related to our customer contracts and in order to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers compensation and automotive liability programs. Additionally, at March 31, 2015, we have a commitment to contribute up to $16 millionto a non-consolidated investment for building and equipment construction. Our software license agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our software products infringe a third partys intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnification agreements and have not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations98Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedIn conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, we may provide routine indemnification agreements such as retention of previously existing environmental, tax and employee liabilities whose terms vary in duration and often are not explicitly defined. Where appropriate, obligations for such indemnifications are recorded as liabilities. Because the amounts of these indemnification obligations often are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of these commitments cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have historically not made material payments as a result of these indemnification provisions.WarrantiesIn the normal course of business, we provide certain warranties and indemnification protection for our products and services. For example, we provide warranties that the pharmaceutical and medical-surgical products we distribute are in compliance with the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other applicable laws and regulations. We have received the same warranties from our suppliers, which customarily are the manufacturers of the products. In addition, we have indemnity obligations to our customers for these products, which have also been provided to us from our suppliers, either through express agreement or by operation of law.We also provide warranties regarding the performance of software and products we sell. Our liability under these warranties is to bring the product into compliance with previously agreed upon specifications. For software products, this may result in additional project costs, which are reflected in our estimates used for the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for software installation services within these contracts. In addition, most of our customers who purchase our software and automation products also purchase annual maintenance agreements. Revenues from these maintenance agreements are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period and the cost of servicing product warranties is charged to expense when claims become estimable. Accrued warranty costs were not material to the consolidated balance sheets23.Other Commitments and Contingent LiabilitiesIn addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. As described below, many of these proceedings are at preliminary stages and many seek an indeterminate amount of damages.When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimates.We are party to the legal proceedings described below. Unless otherwise stated, we are currently unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses for the unresolved proceedings described below. Should any one or a combination of more than one of these proceedings be successful, or should we determine to settle any or a combination of these matters, we may be required to pay substantial sums, become subject to the entry of an injunction or be forced to change the manner in which we operate our business, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. 99Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedI. Litigation and ClaimsOn August 29, 2007, PSKW, LLC filed a lawsuit against McKesson Specialty Arizona Inc. in the New York Supreme Court, New York County, alleging that McKesson Specialty Arizona misappropriated trade secrets and confidential information in launching its LoyaltyScript program, PSKW, LLC V. McKesson Specialty Arizona Inc., Index No. 602921/07. Plaintiff later amended its complaint twice to add additional, but related claims. On August 31, 2011, McKesson Specialty Arizona moved for summary judgment on all claims. On December 23, 2013, the court dismissed PSKWs cause of action for misappropriation of ideas. PSKW appealed this decision and on October 21, 2014, the Appellate Division reversed. On January 30, 2015, the trial court granted McKesson Specialty Arizonas motion to strike the jury and later set trial for June 15, 2015. On April 16, 2013, the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary, U.S. Oncology, Inc. USON, was served with a third amended qui tamcomplaint filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York by tworelators, purportedly on behalf of the United States, twenty-onestates and the District of Columbia, against USON and fiveother defendants, alleging that USON solicited and received illegal kickbacks from Amgen in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, and various state false claims statutes, and seeking damages, treble damages, civil penalties, attorneys fees and costs of suit, all in unspecified amounts, United States ex rel. Piacentile v. Amgen Inc., et al., CV 04-3983 SJ. Previously, the United States declined to intervene in the case as to all allegations and defendants except for Amgen. On February 5, 2013, the United States filed a motion to dismiss the claims pled against Amgen. On September 30, 2013, the court granted the United States motion to dismiss. On April 4, 2014, USON filed a motion to dismiss the claims pled against it. The court has not yet ruled on USONs motion. On June 17, 2014, U.S. Oncology Specialty, LP USOS was served with a fifth amended qui tamcomplaint filed in July 2008 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York by a relator against USOS, among others, alleging that USOS solicited and received illegal kickbacks from Amgen in violation of the Anti-Kickbacks Statute, the False Claims Act, and various state false claims statutes, and seeking damages, treble damages, civil penalties, attorneys fees and costs of suit, all in unspecified amounts, United States ex rel. Hanks v. Amgen, Inc., et al., CV-08-03096 SJ. Previously, the United States declined to intervene in the case as to all allegations and defendants except for Amgen. On August 1, 2014, USOS filed a motion to dismiss the claims pled against it and the hearing occurred on October 7, 2014. The court has not yet ruled on USOSs motion.On May 21, 2014, four hedge funds managed by Magnetar Capital filed a complaint against McKesson Deutschland GmbH Co. KGaA formerly known as Dragonfly GmbH Co. KGaA Dragonfly, a whollyowned subsidiary of the Company, in a German court in Frankfurt, Germany, alleging that Dragonfly violated German takeover law in connection with the Companys acquisition of Celesio by paying more to some holders of Celesios convertible bonds than it paid to the shareholders of Celesios stock, Magnetar Capital Master Fund Ltd. et al. v. Dragonfly GmbH Co KGaA, No3-05O44/14. On December 5, 2014, the court fully dismissed Magnetars lawsuit in Dragonflys favor and ruled that the plaintiffs must bear the court costs and Dragonflys taxable lawyers fees. Magnetar filed a notice of appeal on January 5, 2015.II.Government Subpoenas and Investigations From time-to-time, the Company receives subpoenas or requests for information from various government agencies. The Company generally responds to such subpoenas and requests in a cooperative, thorough and timely manner. These responses sometimes require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by the Company. Such subpoenas and requests also can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of civil or criminal legal proceedings against the Company and other members of the health care industry, as well as to settlements. An example is the subpoena from the office of the Attorney General of West Virginia in the fourth quarter of 2015 seeking information about the Companys distribution of controlled substances in West Virginia. The Company has provided the requested documents100Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedIn addition, in the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the Drug Enforcement Administration DEA, Department of Justice DOJ and various U.S. Attorneys offices to settle all potential administrative and civil claims relating to investigations about the Companys suspicious order reporting practices for controlled substances. The global settlement with the DEA and DOJ is subject to the execution of final settlement agreements. Under the terms of the agreement in principle, the Company has agreed to pay the sum of $150 million, implement certain remedial measures and have the following distribution centers DEA registrations suspended for the specified products and time periods:Aurora, Colorado: all controlled substances for three years; Livonia, Michigan: all controlled substances for two years; Washington Courthouse, Ohio: all controlled substances for the two-year period following completion of the Livonia suspension; and Lakeland, Florida: hydromorphone products for one year.Throughout the terms of these suspensions, the Company will be permitted to continue to ship controlled substances from its Livonia, Washington Courthouse and Lakeland distribution centers to customers that purchase products under its pharmaceutical prime vendor contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Company expects that the suspensions will not result in a supply disruption to any customer. Customers located in the distribution center service areas described above will receive controlled substances from a different distribution center during the applicable suspension periods. As a result of our agreement in principle, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a $150 millionpre-tax and after-tax charge relating to these claims.III.Environmental Matters Primarily as a result of the operation of the Companys former chemical businesses, which were fully divested by 1987, the Company is involved in various matters pursuant to environmental laws and regulations. The Company has received claims and demands from governmental agencies relating to investigative and remedial actions purportedly required to address environmental conditions alleged to exist at sixsites where it, or entities acquired by it, formerly conducted operations and the Company, by administrative order or otherwise, has agreed to take certain actions at those sites, including soil and groundwater remediation. In addition, the Company is one of multiple recipients of a New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Agency directive and a separate United States Environmental Protection Agency directive relating to potential natural resources damages NRD associated with one of these sixsites. Although the Companys potential allocation under either directive cannot be determined at this time, it has agreed to participate with a potentially responsible party PRP group in the funding of certain tasks to support an NRD assessment, the costs of which are reflected in the aggregate estimates set forth below. Based on a determination by the Companys environmental staff, in consultation with outside environmental specialists and counsel, the current estimate of the Companys probable loss associated with the remediation costs for these sixsites is $7million, net of amounts anticipated from third parties. The $7 millionis expected to be paid out between April 2015and March 2035. The Companys estimated probable loss for these environmental matters has been entirely accrued for in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company has been designated as a PRP under the Superfund law for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of its alleged disposal of hazardous substances at 14sites. With respect to these sites, numerous other PRPs have similarly been designated and while the current state of the law potentially imposes joint and several liability upon PRPs, as a practical matter, costs of these sites are typically shared with other PRPs. At one of these sites, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has selected a preferred remedy with an estimated cost of approximately $70 million. It is not certain at this point in time what proportion of this estimated liability will be borne by the Company or by the other PRPs. Accordingly, the Companys estimated probable loss at those 14sites is approximately $22 million, which has been entirely accrued for in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. However, it is possible that the ultimate costs of these matters may exceed or be less than the reserves.  IV. Value Added Tax AssessmentsWe operate in various countries outside the United States whichcollect value added taxes VAT. The determination of the manner in which a VAT applies to our foreign operations is subject to varying interpretations arising from the complex nature of the tax laws. We have receivedassessments for VATwhich are invarious stages of appeal. We disagree with these assessments and believe that we have strong legal arguments to defend our tax positions. CertainVAT assessments relate to years covered by an indemnification agreement. Due to the complex nature of the tax laws, it is not possible to estimate the outcome of these matters. However, based on the currently available information, we believe the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows orresults of operations. 101Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedV. Average Wholesale Price AWP LitigationThe Company has a reserve relating to AWP public entity claims, which is reviewed at least quarterly and whenever events or circumstances indicate changes. We recorded nil, $68 millionand $72 millionof pre-tax charges relating to changes in the Companys AWP litigation reserve, including accrued interest, in 2015, 2014 and 2013. All charges were recorded in operating expenses within our Distribution Solutions segment. Cash payments of nil, $105 millionand $483 millionwere made in 2015, 2014 and 2013. At March 31, 2015, the reserve for this matter was not material; at March 31, 2014, the reserve was $42 million.VI. Other Matters The Company is involved in various other litigation and governmental proceedings, not described above, that arise in the normal course of business. While it is not possible to determine the ultimate outcome or the duration of any such litigation or governmental proceedings, the Company believes, based on current knowledge and the advice of counsel, that such litigation and proceedings will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations24.Stockholders EquityEach share of the Companys outstanding common stock is permitted one vote on proposals presented to stockholders and is entitled to share equally in any dividends declared by the Companys Board of Directors the Board. In July 2013, the quarterly dividend was raised from $020to $024per common share for dividends declared after such date, until further action by the Board. Dividends were $096per share in 2015, $092per share in 2014 and $080per share in 2013. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Companys future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.Share Repurchase PlansStock repurchases may be made from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase ASR programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions102Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedInformation regarding the share repurchase activity over the last three years is as follows:Share Repurchases 1In millions, except price per share dataTotal Number ofSharesPurchased 2 3Average Price Paid Per ShareApproximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the ProgramsBalance, March 31, 2012$299Share repurchase plans approved:April 2012700January 2013500Shares  March 31, 2013$340Shares repurchased$Balance, March 31, 2014$340Shares  March 31, 2015$1This table does not include shares tendered to satisfy the exercise price in connection with cashless exercises of employee stock options or shares tendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with employee equity awards. 2All of the shares purchased were part of the publicly announced programs. 3The number of shares purchased reflects rounding adjustments.In May 2015, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $500 millionof the Companys common stock.During the fourth quarter of 2013, we retired approximately 2 millionshares that were repurchased for $217 millionby the Company.

The factors for determining the reportable segments included the manner in which management evaluates the performance of the Company combined with the nature of the individual business activities. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments on a number of measures, including operating profit before interest expense, income taxes and results from discontinued operations. The McKesson Distribution Solutions segment distributes ethical and proprietary drugs and equipment and health and beauty care products throughout North America and internationally. This segment includes our International pharmaceutical distribution and services business which reflects the results of operations of Celesio, which we acquired in February 2014. This segment also provides specialty pharmaceutical solutions for biotech and pharmaceutical manufacturers, and practice management, technology, clinical support and business solutions to oncology and other specialty practices operating in the community setting. This segment also provides medical-surgical supply distribution, equipment, logistics and other services to healthcare providers through a network of distribution centers within the U.S. In addition, this segment sells financial, operational and clinical solutions for pharmacies retail, hospital, alternate site and provides consulting, outsourcing and other services. In September 2013, we sold our 49%interest in Nadro, S.A. de C.V. Nadro, a pharmaceutical distributor in Mexico. Prior to the sale, financial results for Nadro were included in this segment. The McKesson Technology Solutions segment delivers enterprise-wide clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain, strategic management software solutions, as well as connectivity, outsourcing and other services, including remote hosting and managed services, to healthcare organizations. This segments customers include hospitals, physicians, homecare providers, retail pharmacies and payers primarily from North America.Corporate includes expenses associated with Corporate functions and projects and the results of certain equity investments. Corporate expenses are allocated to the operating segments to the extent that these items can be directly attributable to the segment. 106Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedFinancial information relating to our reportable operating segments and reconciliations to the consolidated totals is as follows:Years Ended March 31,In  Solutions 1North America pharmaceutical distribution and  pharmaceutical distribution and  distribution services5,9075,6483,603Total Distribution  Solutions - products and services3,0693,3303,150Total  profitDistribution   Expenses, Net454449335Interest Expense374300240Income From Continuing Operations Before Income  and amortization 2Distribution   for long-lived assets3Distribution   net by geographic area 4United  derived from services represent less than 2%of this segments total revenues. 2Amounts primarily include amortization of acquired intangible assets purchased in connection with acquisitions, capitalized software held for sale and capitalized software for internal use. 3Long-lived assets consist of property, plant and equipment4Net revenues were attributed to geographic areas based on the customers shipment locations. 107Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedSegment assets and property, plant and equipment, net by geographic areas were as follows:March 31,In millions20152014Segment assetsDistribution   and cash  plant and equipment, netUnited  of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES Continued27.Quarterly Financial Information UnauditedThe quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year.
