ITEM 8.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To theBoard of Directors and Shareholders of AGL Resources Inc. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of AGL Resources Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index appearing under a2presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Company management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As described in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Nicor from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2011.We have also excluded Nicor from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.Nicor is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues represent 47% and 9%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

February 22, 2012  58  Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. On December 9, 2011, we completed our merger with Nicor. As permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, management has elected to exclude Nicor from managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. Assets and revenues of Nicor represent 47% and 9%, respectively, of our total assets and total revenues as reported in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011, in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing herein.

Unless the context requires otherwise, references to we, us, our, the company, or AGL Resources mean consolidated AGL Resources Inc. and its subsidiaries. Business Combinations On December 9, 2011, we closed our merger with Nicor and created a combined company with increased scale and scope in the distribution, storage and transportation of natural gas. See Note 3 for additional information. Basis of Presentation Our consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2011 are prepared in accordance with GAAP and under the rules of the SEC. Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries, the accounts of our majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries and the accounts of our variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary. For unconsolidated entities that we do not control, but exercise significant influence over, we use the equity method of accounting and our proportionate share of income or loss is recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 10 for additional information. We have eliminated intercompany profits and transactions in consolidation except for intercompany profits where recovery of such amounts are probable under the affiliates rate regulation process. Certain amounts from prior periods have been reclassified and revised to conform to the current period presentation. The reclassifications and revisions had no material impact on our prior period balances. Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Methods of Application Cash and Cash Equivalents Our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit, money market accounts and certificates of deposit of domestic subsidiaries with original maturities of three months or less. Receivables and Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Our receivables primarily consist of natural gas sales and transportation services billed to residential, commercial, industrial and other customers. We bill customers monthly, and our accounts receivable are due within 30 days. For the majority of our receivables, we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collection experience and other factors. For receivables where we are aware of a specific customers inability or reluctance to pay, we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect. However, if circumstances change, our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could change as well. Circumstances that could affect our estimates include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, the level of natural gas prices, customer deposits and general economic conditions. Customers accounts are written off once we deem them to be uncollectible. Nicor Gas Credit risk exposure at Nicor Gas is mitigated by the bad debt rider approved by the Illinois Commission on February 2, 2010. The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from or refund to customers of the difference between Nicor Gas actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expense included in its rates for the respective year. For more information on the bad debt rider, see discussion in Regulatory Assets and Liabilities. Atlanta Gas LightConcentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which consist of eleven Marketers in Georgia. The credit risk exposure to Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest exposure in the nonpeak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The functions of the retail sale of gas include customer service, billings, collections, and the purchase and sale of natural gas. Atlanta Gas Lights tariff allows it to obtain security support in an amount equal to no less than two times a Marketers highest months estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light. Investments Our investments in marketable securities are categorized at the date of acquisition as trading, held-to-maturity, or available-for-sale.Trading securities, which includemoney market funds, are carried at fair value and are classified as current assets unless held to satisfy a long-term obligation.We classify money market funds held by our non-United States subsidiaries as short-term investments and all others are classified as cash equivalents.Debt securities are categorized as held-to-maturity when our intent and ability is to hold the securities to maturity.Held-to-maturity securities are included in either short-term or long-term investments based upon their contractual maturity date.We carry held-to-maturity securities at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in common equity as a component of accumulated OCI.Available-for-sale securities are classified as noncurrent assets unless the intent is to sell the security within 12 months.The specific identification method is used to determine realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities. Investments in equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value and do not qualify for the equity method are carried at cost.  66  Our investments in debt and equity securities at December 31 are as follows In millions 2011 Money market funds 59 Corporate bonds 6 Other investments 7 Total 72 Investments in debt and equity securities are classified on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at December 31 as follows In millions 2011 Cash equivalents 9 Short-term investments 53 Long-term investments 10 Total 72 Investments categorized as trading including money market funds totaled $59 million at December 31, 2011.Corporate bonds and certain other investments are categorized as held-to-maturity.The contractual maturities of the held-to-maturity investments at December 31, 2011 are as follows  Years to maturity In millions Less than 1 year 1-5 years 5-10 years Total Held-to-maturity investments 2 5 1 8 Our investments also include certaininvestments, including certificates of deposit and bank accounts, maintained to fulfill statutory or contractual requirements.These investments totaled $2 million at December 31, 2011.In addition, we hold a $3 million investment in a port facility development venture carried at cost. Gains or losses included in earnings resulting from the sale of investments were not significant. Inventories Except for Nicor Gas, distribution operations records natural gas stored underground at WACOG. Nicor Gas inventory is carried at cost on a last-in-first-out LIFO basis. For our wholesale services and retail operations businesses, we account for natural gas inventory at the lower of WACOG or market price. Based on the average cost of gas purchased in December 2011, the estimated replacement cost of Nicor Gas inventory at December 31, 2011 exceeded the LIFO cost by $189 million. During the 22 days of December 2011, Nicor Gas had an immaterial LIFO liquidation. Our retail operations and wholesale services segments evaluate the weighted-average cost of their natural gas inventories against market prices to determine whether any declines in market prices below the WACOG are other-than-temporary. For any declines considered to be other-than-temporary, we record adjustments to reduce the weighted-average cost of the natural gas inventory to market price. Consequently, as a result of declining natural gas prices, Retail operations and wholesale services charged LOCOM adjustments to cost of goods sold, to reduce the value of their inventories to market value in the following amounts. In millions 2011 2010 2009 Retail operations 5 0 6 Wholesale services 31 8 8 In Georgias competitive environment, Marketers including SouthStar, sell natural gas to firm end-use customers at market-based prices. Part of the unbundling process, which resulted from deregulation and provides this competitive environment, is the assignment to Marketers of certain pipeline services that Atlanta Gas Light has under contract. Atlanta Gas Light assigns, on a monthly basis, the majority of the pipeline storage services that it has under contract to Marketers, along with a corresponding amount of inventory.  67  Energy Marketing Receivables and Payables Our wholesale services segment provides services to retail and wholesale marketers and utility and industrial customers. These customers, also known as counterparties, utilize netting agreements, which enable wholesale services to net receivables and payables by counterparty. Wholesale services also nets across product lines and against cash collateral, provided the master netting and cash collateral agreements include such provisions. The amounts due from or owed to wholesale services counterparties are settled net, but are recorded on a gross basis in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as energy marketing receivables and energy marketing payables. Our wholesale services segment has some trade and credit contracts that have explicit minimum credit rating requirements. These credit rating requirements typically give counterparties the right to suspend or terminate credit if our credit ratings are downgraded to non-investment grade status. Under such circumstances, wholesale services would need to post collateral to continue transacting business with some of its counterparties. No collateral has been posted under such provisions since our credit ratings have always exceeded the minimum requirements. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the collateral that wholesale services would have been required to post if our credit ratings had been downgraded to non-investment grade status would not have had a material impact to our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. However, if such collateral were not posted, wholesale services ability to continue transacting business with these counterparties would be negatively impacted. Wholesale services has a concentration of credit risk for services it provides to marketers and to utility and industrial counterparties. This credit risk is measured by 30-day receivable exposure plus forward exposure, which is generally concentrated in 20 of its counterparties. We evaluate the credit risk of our counterparties using a SP equivalent credit rating, which is determined by a process of converting the lower of the SP or Moodys rating to an internal rating ranging from 900 to 100, with 900 being equivalent to AAA/Aaa by SP and Moodys and 100 being equivalent to D or Default by SP and Moodys. For a customer without an external rating, we assign an internal rating based on our analysis of the strength of its financial ratios. The following table provides additional information about wholesale services credit exposure at December 31, 2011, excluding $11 million of customer deposits. Dollars in millions Total 1 of top counterparties Concentration risk Credit exposure 304 20 60 1 Our counterparties or the counterparties guarantors had a weighted average SP equivalent rating of BBB+ at December 31, 2011. The weighted average credit rating is obtained by multiplying each customers assigned internal rating by its credit exposure and then adding the individual results for all counterparties. That total is divided by the aggregate total exposure. This numeric value is converted to an SP equivalent. We have established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, including requirements for posting of collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Collateral or credit security is most often in the form of cash or letters of credit from an investment-grade financial institution, but may also include cash or United States government securities held by a trustee. When wholesale services is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty and it also has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty, the net mark-to-market exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and a reasonable measure of our credit risk. Wholesale services also uses other netting agreements with certain counterparties with whom it conducts significant transactions. Fair Value Measurements The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, short and long-term investments, derivative assets and liabilities, accounts payable, short-term debt, retirement plan assets, other current assets and liabilities and accrued interest approximate fair value. See Note 4 for additional fair value disclosures. As defined in the authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price. We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. We primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements to utilize the best available information. Accordingly, we use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. We are able to classify fair value balances based on the observance of those inputs. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by the guidance are as follows  68  Level 1 Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Our Level 1 items consist of exchange-traded derivatives, money market funds and retirement plan assets. Level 2Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Level 2 includes those financial and commodity instruments that are valued using valuation methodologies. These methodologies are primarily industry-standard methodologies that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. We obtain market price data from multiple sources in order to value some of our Level 2 transactions and this data is representative of transactions that occurred in the market place. As we aggregate our disclosures by counterparty, the underlying transactions for a given counterparty may be a combination of exchange-traded derivatives and values based on other sources. Instruments in this category include shorter tenor exchange-traded and non-exchange-traded derivatives such as OTC forwards and options and retirement plan assets. Level 3Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in managements best estimate of fair value. Level 3 instruments include those that may be more structured or otherwise tailored to customers needs. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities are primarily related to our retirement plan assets as described in Note 4 and Note 6. However, we have nonretirement plan Level 3 assets and liabilities that are described further in Note 3, Note 4 and Note 5. Transfers into and out of Level 3reflect the liquidity at the relevant natural gas trading locations and dates which affects the significance of unobservable inputs used in the valuation applied to natural gas derivatives. Transfers for retirement plan assets are described further in Note 4.We determine both transfers into and out of Level 3 using values at the end of the interim period in which the transfer occurred. The authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures also includes a two-step process to determine if the market for a financial asset is inactive and a transaction is not distressed. Currently, this authoritative guidance does not affect us, as our derivative instruments are traded in active markets. Derivative Instruments Fair Value Hierarchy As required by the authoritative guidance, derivative assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. The determination of the fair values incorporates various factors required under the guidance. These factors include not only the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements such as cash deposits, letters of credit and priority interests, but also the impact of our nonperformance risk on our liabilities. To mitigate the risk that a counterparty to a derivative instrument defaults on settlement or otherwise fails to perform under contractual terms, we have established procedures to monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, seek guarantees or collateral back-up in the form of cash or letters of credit and, in most instances, enter into netting arrangements. See Note 4 for additional fair value disclosures. Netting of Cash Collateral and Derivative Assets and Liabilities under Master Netting ArrangementsWe maintain accounts with brokers to facilitate financial derivative transactions in support of our energy marketing and risk management activities. Based on the value of our positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, we may be required to deposit cash into these broker accounts. Under authoritative guidance related to derivatives and hedging we have elected to net derivative assets and liabilities under master netting arrangements. With that election, we are also required to offset, on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position cash collateral held in our broker accounts with the associated fair value of the instruments in the accounts. See Note 5 for additional information about our cash collateral. Natural Gas Derivative Instruments The fair value of natural gas derivative instruments we use to manage exposures arising from changing natural gas prices reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date, taking into account the current unrealized gains or losses on open contracts. We use external market quotes and indices to value substantially all of our derivative instruments. See Note 5 for additional derivative disclosures. Distribution Operations Nicor Gas, subject to review by the Illinois Commission, and Elizabethtown Gas, in accordance with a directive from the New Jersey BPU, enter into derivative instruments to hedge the impact of market fluctuations in natural gas prices. In accordance with the authoritative guidance related to derivatives and hedging, such derivative transactions are accounted for at fair value each reporting period in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.In accordance with regulatory requirements realized gains and losses related to these derivatives are reflected in natural gas costs and ultimately included in billings to customers. Thus, hedge accounting is not elected and, in accordance with accounting guidance pertaining to rate-regulated entities, unrealized changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are deferred or accrued as regulatory assets or liabilities.  69  Nicor Gas also enters into swap agreements to reduce the earnings volatility of certain forecasted operating costs arising from fluctuations in natural gas prices, such as the purchase of natural gas for use in its operations. These derivative instruments are carried at fair value. To the extent hedge accounting is not elected, changes in such fair values are immediately recorded in the current period as operation and maintenance expense. Retail OperationsWe have designated a portion of these derivative instruments, consisting of financial swaps to manage the risk associated with forecasted natural gas purchases and sales, as cash flow hedges under the authoritative guidance related to derivatives and hedging. We record derivative gains or losses arising from cash flow hedges in OCI and reclassify them into earnings in the same period as the settlement of the underlying hedged item. We currently have minimal hedge ineffectiveness defined as when the gains or losses on the hedging instrument do not offset the losses or gains on the hedged item. This cash flow hedge ineffectiveness is recorded in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which it occurs. We have not designated the remainder of our derivative instruments as hedges under the authoritative guidance related to derivatives and hedging and, accordingly, we record changes in the fair value of such instruments within cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Income in the period of change. We enter into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges of operating margins in the event of warmer-than-normal weather in the Heating Season. We account for these contracts using the intrinsic value method under the authoritative guidance related to financial instruments. These weather derivative instruments do not qualify for accounting hedge designation and changes in value are reflected in cost of goods sold on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Wholesale ServicesWe purchase natural gas for storage when the difference in the current market price we pay to buy and transport natural gas plus the cost to store the natural gas is less than the market price we can receive in the future, resulting in a positive net operating margin. We use NYMEX futures contracts and other OTC derivatives to sell natural gas at that future price to substantially lock in the operating margin we will ultimately realize when the stored natural gas is sold. These futures contracts meet the definition of derivatives under the authoritative guidance related to derivatives and hedging and are accounted for at fair value in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, with changes in fair value recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income in the period of change. These futures contracts are not designated as hedges as may be permitted under the guidance. The purchase, transportation, storage and sale of natural gas are accounted for on a weighted average cost or accrual basis, as appropriate, rather than on the fair value basis we utilize for the derivatives used to mitigate the natural gas price risk associated with our storage portfolio. This difference in accounting can result in volatility in our reported earnings, even though the economic margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated. Midstream Operations During the construction of the storage caverns, Golden Triangle Storage uses derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas that will be purchased in future periods for pad gas. Golden Triangle Storages derivative instruments have been used to economically hedge operational purchases and sales and do not qualify as cash flow hedges. The pad gas is considered to be a component of the storage caverns construction costs; as a result, any derivative gains or losses arising from the cash flow hedges will remain in accumulated OCI until the pad gas is sold, which will not occur until the storage caverns are decommissioned. The fair value of these derivative instruments currently have minimal hedge ineffectiveness which is recorded in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which it occurs. Golden Triangle Storage began entering into these derivative transactions during 2009. Debt We estimate the fair value of debt using a discounted cash flow technique that incorporates a market interest yield curve with adjustments for duration, optionality and risk profile.In determining the market interest yield curve, we consider our currently assigned ratings for unsecured debt and the secured rating for the Nicor Gas first mortgage bonds.  70  Property, Plant and Equipment A summary of our PPE by classification as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 is provided in the following table. In millions
2011 2010 Transmission and distribution 7,579 4,955 Cargo shipping 146 n/a Storage 931 580 Other 747 484 Construction work in progress 376 247 Total gross PPE 9,779 6,266 Less accumulated depreciation 1,879 1,861 Total net PPE 7,900 4,405 Distribution Operations PPE consists of property and equipment that is in use, being held for future use and under construction. We report PPE at its original cost, which includes material and labor contractor costs construction overhead costs an allowance for funds used during construction AFUDC which represents the estimated cost of funds, from both debt and equity sources, used to finance the construction of major projects and is capitalized in rate base for ratemaking purposes when the completed projects are placed in service Nicor Gas pad gas the portion considered to be non-recoverable is recorded as depreciable PPE while the portion considered to be recoverable is recorded as non-depreciable PPE We recognize no gains or losses on depreciable utility property that is retired or otherwise disposed, as required under the composite depreciation method. Such gains and losses are ultimately refunded to or recovered from customers through future rate adjustments. Retail Operations, Wholesale Services, Midstream Operations, Cargo Shipping and Other PPE includes property that is in use and under construction, and we report it at cost. We record a gain or loss for retired or otherwise disposed-of property. Natural gas in salt-dome storage at Jefferson Island and Golden Triangle Storage that is retained as pad gas is classified as non-depreciable PPE and is valued at cost. Central Valley has two types of pad gas in its reservoir storage facility. The first is non-depreciable PPE, which is valued at cost, and the second is non-recoverable to which we have no contractual ownership. Depreciation Expense We compute depreciation expense for distribution operations by applying composite, straight-line rates approved by the state regulatory agencies to the investment in depreciable property. More information on our rates used and the rate method is provided in the following table. 2011 2010 2009 Atlanta Gas Light 1 26 25 25 Chattanooga Gas 1 25 28 34 Elizabethtown Gas 2 25 24 31 Elkton Gas 2 24 23 21 Florida City Gas 2 39 37 39 Nicor Gas 2 41 n/a n/a Virginia Natural Gas 1 25 30 26 1 Average composite straight-line depreciation rates for depreciable property, excluding transportation equipment 2 Composite straight-line depreciation rates We compute depreciation expense on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives of the assets. In years Estimated useful life Transportation equipment 1 5 - 10 Cargo shipping- vessels 20 - 25 Cargo shipping- freight equipment and freight handling equipment 8 - 18 Storage caverns 40 Other up to 40 1 May be depreciated in excess of useful life and recovered in rates.  71  AFUDC and Capitalized Interest Four of our utilities are authorized by applicable state regulatory agencies or legislatures to capitalize the cost of debt and equity funds as part of the cost of construction projects in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Nicor Gas does not have authorized AFUDC rates, but rather capitalizes AFUDC at the current actual cost of debt. The capital expenditures of our two other utilities do not qualify for AFUDC treatment. More information on our authorized AFUDC rates is provided in the following table.  2011 2010 2009 Atlanta Gas Light 1 810 810 853 Chattanooga Gas 2 741 741 789 Elizabethtown Gas 3 053 040 041 Virginia Natural Gas 4 738 0 924 AFUDC in millions 5 6 3 13 1 New rate as of November 1, 2010. 2 New rate as of June 1, 2010. 3 Variable rate is determined by FERC method of AFUDC accounting. 4 Approved only for Hampton Roads construction project which ended in 2009.Virginia Natural Gasreceived no AFUDC interest for 2010 or 2011. 5 Expense recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Within our midstream operations segment, we have recorded capitalized interest as part of the cost of the Golden Triangle Storage and Central Valley construction projects in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, and within interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income, in the amounts of $1 million in 2011, $5 million in 2010 and $3 million in 2009. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. The fair values assigned to the trade name and customer relationship intangible assets at Nicors unregulated operations were determined using a combination of the cost savings, the multi-period excess earnings and the relief-from-royalty approaches. In accordance with the authoritative guidance, we evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. These indicators include, but are not limited to, a significant change in operating performance, the business climate, legal or regulatory factors, or a planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. We test goodwill impairment utilizing a fair value approach at a reporting-unit level which generally equates to our operating segments as discussed in Note 13. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. See Note 3 for a rollforward of total goodwill by operating segment. Our goodwill impairment analysis for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was performed during the fourth quarter of each year and indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit is substantially in excess of carrying value, and the reporting units are not at risk of failing Step 1 of the impairment evaluation. As a result, we did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges. In accordance with the authoritative guidance, we amortize intangible assets over their useful lives. These assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators arise, at which time we assess the recoverability of such assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows. In the event the sum of the expected future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value is recorded. No impairment has been recognized. We currently have no material indefinite lived intangible assets. Taxes The reporting of our assets and liabilities for financial accounting purposes differs from the reporting for income tax purposes. The principal differences between net income and taxable income relate to the timing of deductions, primarily due to the benefits of tax depreciation since we generally depreciate assets for tax purposes over a shorter period of time than for book purposes. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We report the tax effects of depreciation and other differences in those items as deferred income tax assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position in accordance with authoritative guidance related to income taxes. Income TaxesWe have two categories of income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Income: current and deferred. Current income tax expense consists of federal and state income tax less applicable tax credits related to the current year. Deferred income tax expense generally is equal to the changes in the deferred income tax liability and regulatory tax liability during the year.  72  Investment and Other Tax CreditsDeferred investment tax credits associated with distribution operations are included as a regulatory liability in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. These investment tax credits are being amortized over the estimated life of the related properties as credits to income in accordance with regulatory requirements. Accumulated Deferred Income Tax Assets and LiabilitiesAs noted above, we report some of our assets and liabilities differently for financial accounting purposes than we do for income tax purposes. We report the tax effects of the differences in those items as deferred income tax assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. We measure these deferred income tax assets and liabilities using enacted income tax rates. Regulatory Income Tax Liability For our regulated utilities we also measure deferred income tax assets and liabilities using enacted income tax rates. Thus, when the statutory income tax rate declines before a temporary difference has fully reversed, the deferred income tax liability must be reduced to reflect the newly enacted income tax rates. In accordance with authoritative guidance related to rate-regulated entities, the amount of such a reduction is transferred to our regulatory income tax liability, which we are amortizing over the lives of the related properties as the temporary difference reverses or approximately 30 years. A deferred income tax liability is not recorded on undistributed foreign earnings that are expected to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. We consider, among other factors, actual cash investments offshore as well as projected cash requirements in making this determination. Changes in our investment or repatriation plans or circumstances could result in a different deferred income tax liability. Tax BenefitsThe authoritative guidance related to income taxes requires us to determine whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on our tax return should be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Under this guidance, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This guidance also addresses derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting in interim periods. Uncertain Tax Positions We recognize accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties in operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2011, we did not have a liability recorded for payment of interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions. Tax Collections We do not collect income taxes from our customers on behalf of governmental authorities. We collect and remit various taxes on behalf of various governmental authorities. We record these amounts in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. In other instances, we are allowed to recover from customers other taxes that are imposed upon us. We record such taxes as operating expense and record the corresponding customer charges as revenue. These taxes were immaterial for all periods presented. Revenues Distribution operations We record revenues when services are provided to customers. Those revenues are based on rates approved by the state regulatory commissions of our utilities. As required by the Georgia Commission, in July 1998, Atlanta Gas Light began billing Marketers in equal monthly installments for each residential, commercial and industrial customers distribution costs. As required by the Georgia Commission, effective February 1, 2001, Atlanta Gas Light implemented a seasonal rate design for the calculation of each residential customers annual straight-fixed-variable SFV capacity charge, which is billed to Marketers and reflects the historic volumetric usage pattern for the entire residential class. Generally, this change results in residential customers being billed by Marketers for a higher capacity charge in the winter months and a lower charge in the summer months. This requirement has an operating cash flow impact but does not change revenue recognition. As a result, Atlanta Gas Light continues to recognize its residential SFV capacity revenues for financial reporting purposes in equal monthly installments. All of our utilities, with the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, have rate structures include volumetric rate designs that allow recovery of costs through gas usage. Revenues from sales and transportation services are recognized in the same period in which the related volumes are delivered to customers. Revenues from residential and certain commercial and industrial customers are recognized on the basis of scheduled meter readings. Additionally, revenues are recorded for estimated deliveries of gas not yet billed to these customers, from the last bill date to the end of the accounting period. These are included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as unbilled revenue. For other commercial and industrial customers and all wholesale customers, revenues are based on actual deliveries to the end of the period. The tariffs for Virginia Natural Gas, Elizabethtown Gas and Chattanooga Gas contain WNAs that partially mitigate the impact of unusually cold or warm weather on customer billings and operating margin. The WNAs purpose is to reduce the effect of weather on customer bills by reducing bills when winter weather is colder than normal and increasing bills when weather is warmer than normal. In addition, the tariffs for Chattanooga Gas and Elkton Gas contain revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate the impact of conservation and declining customer usage.  73  Retail operations Revenues from sales and transportation services are recognized in the same period in which the related volumes are delivered to customers. Sales revenues from residential and certain commercial and industrial customers are recognized on the basis of scheduled meter readings. In addition, revenues are recorded for estimated deliveries of gas not yet billed to these customers, from the most recent meter reading date to the end of the accounting period. These are included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as unbilled revenue. For other commercial and industrial customers and all wholesale customers, revenues are based on actual deliveries during the period. We recognize revenue on 12-month utility-bill management contracts as the lesser of cumulative earned or cumulative billed amounts.We recognize revenue for warranty and repair contracts on a straight-line basis over the contract term.Revenue for maintenance services is recognized at the time such services are performed. Wholesale services We record wholesale services revenues when services are provided to customers. Profits from sales between segments are eliminated in the other segment and are recognized as goods or services sold to end-use customers. Transactions that qualify as derivatives under authoritative guidance related to derivatives and hedging are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period of change and characterized as unrealized gains or losses. Gains and losses on derivatives held for energy trading purposes are required to be presented net in revenue. Midstream operations We record operating revenues at Jefferson Island and Golden Triangle Storage in the period in which actual volumes are transported and storage services are provided. The majority of our storage services are covered under medium to long-term contracts at fixed market-based rates. We recognize our park and loan revenues ratably over the life of the contract. Cargo shipping Revenues and related delivery costs are recognized at the time vessels depart from port. Insurance premiums are recognized when the vessel carrying the insured cargo reaches its port of destination and the insured cargo is released to the consignee. The portion of premiums not earned at the end of the year is recorded as unearned premiums. Cost of goods sold Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, we charge our utility customers for natural gas consumed using natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the state regulatory agencies. Under these mechanisms, all prudently incurred natural gas costs are passed through to customers without markup, subject to regulatory review. Therefore, in accordance with the authoritative guidance for rate-regulated entities, we defer or accrue that is, include as an asset or liability in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and exclude from or include in the Statements of Consolidated Income, respectively the difference between the actual cost of goods sold incurred and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period, such that no operating margin is recognized related to these costs. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to our customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets identified as recoverable natural gas costs, and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities which are identified as accrued natural gas costs within our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. For more information, see Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in Note 2. Our retail operations customers are charged for natural gas consumed. We also include within our cost of goods sold costs of fuel and lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of our inventories to market value and for gains and losses associated with certain derivatives. Repair and maintenance expense We record expense for repair and maintenance costs as incurred. This includes expenses for planned major maintenance, such as dry-docking the vessels owned by our cargo shipping business. Operating leases We have certain operating leases with provisions for step rent or escalation payments and certain lease concessions. We account for these leases by recognizing the future minimum lease payments on a straight-line basis over the respective minimum lease terms, in accordance with authoritative guidance related to leases. This accounting treatment does not affect the future annual operating lease cash obligations. For more information, see Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies in Note 11.  74  Earnings Per Common Share We compute basic earnings per common share attributable to AGL Resources Inc. common shareholders by dividing our income attributable to AGL Resources Inc. by the daily weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share attributable to AGL Resources Inc. common shareholders reflect the potential reduction in earnings per common share attributable to AGL Resources Inc. common shareholders that could occur when potentially dilutive common shares are added to common shares outstanding. The increase in weighted average shares is due to the issuance of 382 million shares in connection with the Nicor merger on December 9, 2011. The effect of the additional shares was reduced as the shares were only outstanding for 22 days. We had 1170 million shares outstanding as of December 31, 2011. We derive our potentially dilutive common shares by calculating the number of shares issuable under restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock options. The vesting of shares of the restricted stock and restricted stock units depends on the satisfaction of certain performance criteria. The future issuance of shares underlying the outstanding stock options depends on whether the exercise prices of the stock options are less than the average market price of the common shares for the respective periods. The following table shows the calculation of our diluted shares attributable to AGL Resources Inc. common shareholders for the periods presented, ifperformance units currently earned under the plan ultimately vest and if stock options currently exercisable at prices below the average market prices are exercised In millions except per share amounts 2011 2010 2009 Net income attributable to AGL Resources Inc. 172 234 222 Denominator Basic weighted-average number of shares outstanding 1 804 774 768 Effect of dilutive securities 05 04 03 Diluted weighted-average number of shares outstanding 809 778 771  Basic and diluted earnings per share Basic 214 302 289 Diluted 212 300 288 1Daily weighted average shares outstanding. The following table contains the weighted average shares attributable to outstanding stock options that were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share attributable to AGL Resources Inc. because their effect would have been anti-dilutive, as the exercise prices were greater than the average market price December 31 In millions
2011 2010 2009 Twelve months ended 00 08 20 The decrease in the number of shares that were excluded from the computation for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 is the result of an increase in the average market value of our common shares for the years ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010 and 2009. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities We account for the financial effects of regulation in accordance with authoritative guidance related to regulated entities whose rates are designed to recover the costs of providing service. In accordance with this guidance, incurred costs and estimated future expenditures that would otherwise be charged to expense in the current period are capitalized as regulatory assets when it is probable that such costs or expenditures will be recovered in rates in the future. Similarly, we recognize regulatory liabilities when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have not yet been incurred. Generally, regulatory assets are amortized into expense and regulatory liabilities are amortized into income over the period authorized by the regulatory commissions. Our regulatory assets and liabilities and associated assets and liabilities as of December 31, are summarized in the following table.  75  In millions 2011 2010 Regulatory assets - current Recoverable regulatory infrastructure program costs 48 48 Recoverable ERC 7 7 Recoverable seasonal rates 10 11 Recoverable retirement benefit costs 29 0 Other 37 26 Total regulatory assets - current 131 92 Regulatory assets - long-term Recoverable regulatory infrastructure program costs 305 244 Recoverable retirement benefit costs 262 9 Recoverable ERC 351 164 Unamortized losses on reacquired debt 21 11 Other 140 25 Total regulatory assets - long-term 1,079 453 Total regulatory assets 1,210 545 Regulatory liabilities - current Accumulated removal costs 14 0 Accrued natural gas costs 53 23 Bad debt rider 30 0 Other 15 8 Total regulatory liabilities - current 112 31 Regulatory liabilities - long-term Accumulated removal costs 1,321 182 Regulatory income tax liability 27 15 Bad debt rider 14 0 Unamortized investment tax credit 32 12 Other 11 16 Total regulatory liabilities - long-term 1,405 225 Total regulatoryliabilities 1,517 256 The increase of $665 million in regulatory assets includes $545 million related to the addition of Nicor Gas regulatory assets and the increase of $1,261 million in regulatory liabilities includes $1,330 million related to the addition of Nicor Gas regulatory liabilities. Our regulatory assets are probable or recovery specifically authorized by a state regulatory commission. Base rates are designed to provide both a recovery of cost and a return on investment during the period rates are in effect. As such, all of our regulatory assets recoverable through base rates are subject to review by the respective state regulatory commission during future rate proceedings. We are not aware of any evidence that these costs will not be recoverable through either rate riders or base rates, and we believe that we will be able to recover such costs, consistent with our historical recoveries. In the event that the provisions of authoritative guidance related to regulated operations were no longer applicable, we would recognize a write-off of regulatory assets that would result in a charge to net income, and be classified as an extraordinary item. Additionally, while some regulatory liabilities would be written-off, others would continue to be recorded as liabilities but not as regulatory liabilities. Although the natural gas distribution industry is competing with alternative fuels, primarily electricity, our utility operations continue to recover their costs through cost-based rates established by the state regulatory commissions. As a result, we believe that the accounting prescribed under the guidance remains appropriate. It is also our opinion that all regulatory assets are recoverable in future rate proceedings, and therefore we have not recorded any regulatory assets that are recoverable but are not yet included in base rates or contemplated in a rate rider. The regulatory liabilities that do not represent revenue collected from customers for expenditures that have not yet been incurred are refunded to ratepayers through a rate rider or base rates. If the regulatory liability is included in base rates, the amount is reflected as a reduction to the rate base in setting rates. The majority of our regulatory assets listed in the preceding table are included in base rates except for the recoverable regulatory infrastructure program costs, recoverable ERC, the bad debt rider and accrued natural gas costs, which are recovered through specific rate riders on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The rate riders that authorize the recovery of regulatory infrastructure program costs and natural gas costs include both a recovery of cost and a return on investment during the recovery period. Nicor Gas rate riders for environmental costs and energy efficiency costs also provide a return on investment during the period of recovery. However, there is no interest associated with the under or over collections of bad debt expense. The Illinois Commission presently does not allow Nicor Gas the opportunity to earn a return on its recoverable retirement benefit costs. Such cost are expected to be recovered over a period of 9 to 11 years. The regulatory assets related to debt are also not included in rate base, but the costs are recovered over the term of the debt through the authorized rate of return component of base rates.  76  Environmental Remediation Costs Our ERC liabilities are estimates of future remediation costs for investigation and clean up of our former operating sites that are contaminated. Our estimates are based on probabilistic models of potential costs, on an undiscounted basis. As cleanup options and plans mature and cleanup contracts are entered into, we are able to provide conventional engineering estimates of the likely costs of remediation at our former sites. These estimates contain various engineering uncertainties, but we continuously attempt to refine and update them. These liabilities do not include other potential expenses, such as unasserted property damage claims, personal injury or natural resource damage claims, unbudgeted legal expenses or other costs for which we may be held liable but for which we cannot reasonably estimate an amount. However, we have not yet performed these probabilistic models for all of our sites in Illinois, which will be completed in 2012. Our paid and accrued ERCs are deferred in a corresponding regulatory asset until the costs are recovered from customers. We primarily recover these deferred costs through three rate riders that authorize dollar-for-dollar recovery. The ERC rate rider for Atlanta Gas Light only allows for recovery of the costs incurred over the subsequent five-year period. ERC associated with the investigation and remediation of Nicor Gas and Elizabethtown Gas remediation sites located in the states of Illinois and New Jersey are recovered under remediation adjustment clauses that include carrying cost on unrecovered expenditures. For more information on our ERC liabilities, see Note 11. Bad Debt Rider Nicor Gas bad debt rider provides for the recovery from or refund to customers of the difference between Nicor Gas actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expense included in its rates for the respective year. The benchmark, against which 2011 actual bad debt experience is compared, is approximately $63 million. Nicor Gas actual 2011 bad debt expense was $31 million, resulting in a refund to customers of $32 million which will be refunded between June 2012 and May 2013. The prior years bad debt rider is recorded within operating expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income and the over, or under, recovery is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Other Regulatory Assets and Liabilities Our recoverable retirement benefit plan costs are recoverable through base rates over the next 2 to 21 years based on the remaining recovery period as designated by the applicable state regulatory commissions. Recoverable seasonal rates reflect the difference between the recognition of a portion of Atlanta Gas Lights residential base rates revenues on a straight-line basis as compared to the collection of the revenues over a seasonal pattern. These amounts are fully recoverable through base rates within one year. Accumulated Removal CostsIn accordance with regulatory treatment, our depreciation rates are comprised of two cost components historical cost, net of estimated salvage, and the estimated cost of removal, or retirement, of certain regulated properties. We collect these costs in base rates through straight-line depreciation expense, with a corresponding credit to accumulated depreciation. Because the accumulated estimated removal costs meet the requirements of authoritative guidance related to regulated operations, we have accounted for them as a regulatory liability and have reclassified them from accumulated depreciation to accumulated removal costs in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. In the rate setting process, the liability for these accumulated removal costs are treated as a reduction to the net rate base upon which our regulated utilities have the opportunity to earn their allowed rate of return. Our accumulated removal costs increased $11 billion from December 31, 2010, principally related to Nicor Gas. Regulatory Infrastructure Programs By order of the Georgia Commission through a joint stipulation and a subsequent settlement agreement between Atlanta Gas Light and the Georgia Commission, Atlanta Gas Light began a pipeline replacement program to replace all bare steel and cast iron pipe in its system by December 2013. If Atlanta Gas Light does not perform in accordance with this order, it will be assessed certain nonperformance penalties. As of 2011, we have completed the replacement of all our cast iron pipes, and the remaining replacements are on schedule. The order provides for recovery of all prudent costs incurred in the performance of the program, which Atlanta Gas Light has recorded as a regulatory asset. Atlanta Gas Light will recover from end-use customers, through billings to Marketers, the costs related to the program net of any cost savings from the program. All such amounts will be recovered through a combination of straight-fixed-variable rates and a pipeline replacement revenue rider. The regulatory asset has two components the costs incurred to date that have not yet been recovered through the rate rider the future expected costs to be recovered through the rate rider  77  Atlanta Gas Light has recorded a noncurrent regulatory asset of $48 million, which represents the expected future collection of both expenditures already incurred and expected future capital expenditures to be incurred through the remainder of the program. Atlanta Gas Light has also recorded a non-current asset of $305 million, which represents the expected amount to be collected from customers over the next 12 months. The amounts recovered from the pipeline replacement revenue rider during the last three years were 48 million in 2011 45 million in 2010 41 million in 2009 As of December 31, 2011, Atlanta Gas Light had recorded a current liability of $131 million representing expected program expenditures for the next 12 months and a noncurrent liability of $145 million, representing expected program expenditures through the end of the program in 2013. Atlanta Gas Light capitalizes and depreciates the capital expenditure costs incurred from the pipeline replacement program over the life of the assets. Operation and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Recoveries, which are recorded as revenue, are based on a formula that allows Atlanta Gas Light to recover operation and maintenance costs in excess of those included in its current base rates, depreciation expense and an allowed rate of return on capital expenditures. In the near term, the primary financial impact to Atlanta Gas Light from the pipeline replacement program is reduced cash flow from operating and investing activities, as the timing related to cost recovery does not match the timing of when costs are incurred. However, Atlanta Gas Light is allowed the recovery of carrying costs on the under-recovered balance resulting from the timing difference. The Georgia Commission has also approved Atlanta Gas Lights STRIDE program, which is comprised of the ongoing pipeline replacement program, the new Integrated System Reinforcement Program i-SRP and the new Integrated Customer Growth Program i-CGP. The purpose of the i-SRP is to upgrade Atlanta Gas Lights distribution system and liquefied natural gas facilities in Georgia, improve its system reliability and operational flexibility, and create a platform to meet long-term forecasted growth. Atlanta Gas Light will be required to file an updated ten-year forecast of infrastructure requirements under the i-SRP along with a new three-year construction plan every three years for review and approval by the Georgia Commission. Under i-CGP, the Georgia Commission authorized Atlanta Gas Light to extend its pipeline facilities to serve customers without pipeline access and create new economic development opportunities in Georgia. The i-CGP was approved as a three-year pilot program under STRIDE, and all related costs will be recovered through a surcharge. In 2009, the New Jersey BPU approved an enhanced infrastructure program for Elizabethtown Gas, which was created in response to the New Jersey Governors request for utilities to assist in the economic recovery by increasing infrastructure investments. In May 2011, the New Jersey BPU approved Elizabethtown Gas request to spend an additional $40 million under this program before the end of 2012. Costs associated with the investment in this program are recovered through periodic adjustments to base rates. We expect to file for an extension of the program in 2012. Accounting for Retirement Benefit Plans The authoritative guidance related to retirement benefits requires that we recognize all obligations related to defined benefit retirement plans and quantify the plans funded status as an asset or a liability on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The guidance further requires that we measure the plans assets and obligations that determine our funded status as of the end of the fiscal year. We are also required to recognize as a component of OCI the changes in funded status that occurred during the year that are not yet recognized as part of net periodic benefit cost as explained in authoritative guidance related to retirement benefits. Because substantially all of its retirement costs are recoverable through base rates, Nicor Gas generally defers any charge or credit to a regulatory asset or liability until the period in which the costs are included in base rates, in accordance with the authoritative guidance for rate-regulated entities. The assets of our retirement plans were accounted for at fair value and are classified in the fair value hierarchy in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Non-Wholly Owned Entities We hold ownership interests in a number of business ventures with varying ownership structures. We evaluate all of our partnership interests and other variable interests to determine if each entity is a variable interest entity VIE, as defined in the authoritative accounting guidance. If a venture is a VIE for which we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the entity. We reassess our conclusion as to whether an entity is a VIE upon certain occurrences which are deemed reconsideration events under the guidance. For entities that are not determined to be VIEs, we evaluate whether we have control or significant influence over the joint venture to determine the appropriate consolidation and presentation. Generally, entities under our control are consolidated, and entities over which we can exert significant influence, but do not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We have concluded that the only venture that we are required to consolidate as a VIE, as we are the primary beneficiary, is SouthStar. We recognize on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, Piedmonts share of the non-wholly owned entity as a separate component of equity entitled noncontrolling interest. Piedmonts share of current operations is reflected in net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The authoritative guidance has no effect on our calculation of basic or diluted earnings per common share amounts, which are based upon net income attributable to AGL Resources Inc. For additional information, see Note 10. We also invest in partnerships and limited liability companies that are accounted for under the equity method, but are not joint ventures.In accordance with the authoritative guidance, all such investments are required to use the equity method unless our interest is so minor that there is virtually no influence over operating and financial policies. Investments accounted for under the equity method are included in long-term investments on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, and the equity income is recorded in equity investment income on our Consolidated Statements of Income and was immaterial for all periods presented. For additional information, see Note 10.  78  Use of Accounting Estimates The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures. We based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Our estimates may involve complex situations requiring a high degree of judgment either in the application and interpretation of existing literature or in the development of estimates that impact our financial statements. The most significant estimates relate to our pipeline replacement program accruals, environmental liability accruals, uncollectible accounts and other allowance for contingent losses, goodwill and intangible assets, retirement plan obligations, derivative and hedging activities and provisions for income taxes. Our actual results could differ from our estimates. Note 3 Merger with Nicor On December 9, 2011, we completed our merger with Nicor. In accordance with the Merger Agreement, each share of Nicor common stock outstanding at the Effective Date, other than shares cancelled and Dissenting Shares, as defined in the Merger Agreement, was converted into purchase consideration of i 08382 of a share of AGL Resources common stock and ii $2120 in cash. Fractional shares were not issued in connection with the merger as Nicor shareholders who would have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of AGL Resources common stock received cash settlements. Additionally, cash was paid to repurchase stock options and restricted stock units that were awardedfor pre-merger services. Nicors previous shareholders own approximately 33% of the combined company. The value of the consideration paid to Nicor shareholders was calculated as follows In millions, except per share price Nicor shares outstanding at the Effective Date 455 Exchange ratio 08382 Number of shares of AGL Resources common stock issued 382 Volume-weighted average price of AGL Resources common stock on December 8, 2011 3990 Cost of equity issued 1,523  Nicor shares outstanding at the Effective Date 455 Cash payment per share of Nicor common stock 2120 Cash paid for Nicor common shares outstanding 966 Cash paid to repurchase outstanding equity awards 14 Cost of debt issued 980 Total purchase consideration 2,503 The preliminary allocation of the total consideration transferred in the merger to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed includes adjustments for the fair value of Nicors assets and liabilities, and was performed by a third-party independent valuation specialist. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is presented in the following table. In millions Current assets 932 Property, plant and equipment 3,202 Goodwill 1,395 Other noncurrent assets, excluding goodwill 791 Current liabilities 1,170 Long-term debt 599 Other noncurrent liabilities 2,048 Total purchase consideration 2,503 The estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed were determined based on the accounting guidance for fair value measurements under GAAP, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The estimated fair value measurements assume the highest and best use of the assets by market participants, considering the use of the asset that is physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible at the measurement date. Modifications to the purchase price allocation may occur as a result of continuing review of the assumptions and estimates underlying the preliminary fair value adjustments of environmental site remediation and other adjustments.  79  The excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes. A preliminary rollforward of total goodwill recognized by segment in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position is as follows In millions Distribution Operations Retail Operations Wholesale Services Midstream Operations Cargo Shipping Other Consolidated As of December 31, 2010 404 0 0 14 0 0 418 Merger with Nicor 1,182 124 2 2 77 8 1,395 As of December 31, 2011 1,586 124 2 16 77 8 1,813 The preliminary valuation of the additional intangible assets recorded as result of the merger is as follows In millions Preliminary Valuation Weighted-average amortization period Trade names  Retail Operations 33 15 years Cargo Shipping 15 15 years   Customer relationships  Retail Operations 52 10 years Cargo Shipping 3 18 years Total 103
The fair value measurements of intangible assets were primarily based on significant unobservable inputs and thus represent level 3 measurements as defined in accounting guidance for fair value measurements.

These costs were expensed as incurred and separately stated in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Themerger transaction costs recognized for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 includes $34million $31 million net of tax of change in control and other benefit payments. The amounts of revenue and earnings of Nicor included in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the period subsequent to the December 9, 2011 closing date are as follows  80  In millions, except per share amounts December 10, 2011- December 31, 2011 Total revenues 209 Net income 1 24 Basic earnings per common share 030 Diluted earnings per common share 030 1 Includes change in control expenses of $31 million net of taxes. Pro forma financial information The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects our consolidated results of operations as if the merger with Nicor had taken place on January1, 2010. The unaudited pro forma information has been calculated after conforming our accounting policies and adjusting Nicors results to reflect the depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment, debt and intangible assets had been applied on January1, 2010, together with the consequential tax effects. AGL Resources and Nicor together incurred approximately $86 million ofcosts directly related to the merger in the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and $10 million for the same period in 2010. These expenses are excluded from the pro forma earnings presented below. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of results of operations that would have been achieved had the pro forma events taken place on the dates indicated, or the future consolidated results of operations of the combined company.  12 months ended December 31 In millions, except per share amounts 2011 2010 Total revenues 4,715 5,083 Net income attributable to parent 313 343 Basic earnings per common share 269 297 Diluted earnings per common share 268 296 Note 4 Fair Value Measurements Derivative Instruments The following table summarizes, by level within the fair value hierarchy, our derivative assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.

Money Market Funds At December 31, 2011, we held $59 million in money market funds which are recorded at fair value and classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Retirement benefit plans The target asset allocation of the Nicor Companies Pension and Retirement Plan Nicor Gas Retirement Plan is approximately 60% equity and 40% fixed income. The AGL Resources Inc. Retirement Plan AGL Retirement Plan, the Employees Retirement Plan of NUI Corporation NUI Retirement Plan, the Health and Welfare Plan for Retirees and Inactive Employees of AGL Resources Inc. AGL Postretirement Plan target asset allocations are approximately 80% equity and 20% fixed income. The plans investments policy provides for some variation in these targets.

We estimate the fair value of our debt using a discounted cash flow technique that incorporates a market interest yield curve with adjustments for duration, optionality and risk profile. The following table presents the amortized cost and fair value of our long-term debt for the following periods.  As of December 31 In millions 2011 2010 Long-term debt amortized cost 1 3,576 1,971 Long-term debt fair value 1 3,938 2,122  1December 31, 2011 includes the debt assumed in the Nicor merger with a carrying value of $500 million, 
as well as $15 million of medium-term notes that are due in June 2012. December 31, 2010 includes $300 million of senior notes repaid in January 2011. Note 5 Derivative Instruments Derivative Instruments Our risk management activities are monitored by our Risk Management Committee, which consists of members of senior management and is charged with reviewing and enforcing our risk management activities and policies. Our use of derivative instruments, including physical transactions, is limited to predefined risk tolerances associated with pre-existing or anticipated physical natural gas sales and purchases and system use and storage. We use the following types of derivative instruments and energy-related contracts to manage natural gas price, interest rate, weather, automobile fuel price and foreign currency risks forward contracts futures contracts options contracts financial swaps treasury locks weather derivative contracts storage and transportation capacity transactions foreign currency forward contracts Certain of our derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related or other contingent features that could increase the payments for collateral we post in the normal course of business when our financial instruments are in net liability positions. As of December 31, 2011 for agreements with such features, derivative instruments with liability fair values totaled approximately $110 million for which we had posted no collateral to our counterparties. In addition, our energy marketing receivables and payables, which also have credit-risk-related or other contingent features, are discussed in Note 2. Our derivative instrument activities are included within operating cash flows as an adjustment to net income of $24 million in 2011, $2 million in 2010 and $11 million in 2009. On May 4, 2011, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $250 million to effectively convert a portion of our fixed-rate interest obligation on the $300 million 640% senior notes due July 15, 2016 to a variable-rate obligation. We pay a floating interest rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 39%. We designated these interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. We also held forward-starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount totaling $90 million at December 31, 2011, that were redesignated as cash flow hedges upon the close of the merger. Under the terms of the swaps, we agree to pay a fixed swap rate and receive a floating rate based on a variable three-month LIBOR rate. We designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. The fair values of our interest rate swaps were reflected as a long-term derivative asset of $13 million and a short-term liability of $13 million at December 31, 2011. For more information on our debt, see Note 8.  83  The table below summarizes the various ways in which we account for our derivative instruments and the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements Accounting Treatment Recognition and Measurement Statement of Financial Position Income Statement Cash flow hedge Derivative carried at fair value Ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings 
Effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss Effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reclassified out of accumulated OCI loss and into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings Fair value hedge Derivative carried at fair value Changes in fair value of the hedged item are recorded asadjustments to the carrying amount of the hedged item Gains or losses on the derivative instrument and the hedged item are recognized in earnings. As a result, to the extent the hedge is effective, the gains or losses will offset and there is no impact on earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness will impact earnings. Not designated as hedges Derivative carried at fair value Realized and unrealized gains or losses on the derivative instrument are recognized in earnings 
Nicor Gas and Elizabethtown Gas unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities until included in natural gas costs The gain or loss on these derivative instruments is reflected in natural gas costs and is ultimately included in billings to customers Quantitative Disclosures Related to Derivative Instruments As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, our derivative instruments were comprised of both long and short natural gas positions. A long position is a contract to purchase natural gas, and a short position is a contract to sell natural gas. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had net long natural gas contracts outstanding in the following quantities Natural gas contracts Distribution Operations3 All Other In Bcf December 31, 2011 1 December 31, 2010 December 31, 2011 1 December 31, 2010 Hedge designation Cash flow 0 0 5 4 Not designated 48 18 138 202 Total 48 18 143 206 Hedge position Short 0 0 1,680 1,605 Long 48 18 1,823 1,811 Net long position 48 18 143 206 1 Approximately 97% of these contracts have durations of two years or less and the remaining 3% expire in 3 to 6 years. 2 Volumes related to Nicor Gas exclude variable-priced contracts, which are accounted for as derivatives, but whose fair values are not directly impacted by changes in commodity prices. Derivative Instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position In accordance with regulatory requirements, gains and losses on derivative instruments used at Nicor Gas and Elizabethtown Gas in our distribution operations segment were reflected in accrued natural gas costs within our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

As a result, the amounts above do not include cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts of $147million as of December 31, 2011 and $105million as of December 31, 2010. Accordingly, the amounts above will differ from the amounts presented on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and the fair value information presented for our derivative instruments in the recurring fair values table of Note 4. Derivative Instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Income The following table presents the gain or loss on derivative instruments in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.

Any amounts recognized in operating income, related to ineffectiveness or due to a forecasted transaction that is no longer expected to occur, were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Our expected net loss to be reclassified from OCI into cost of goods sold, operation and maintenance expense, and operating revenues and recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income over the next 12 months is $2 million. These pre-tax deferred losses are recorded in OCI related to natural gas derivative contracts associated with retail operations and with Nicor Gas system use. The expected losses are based upon the fair values of these financial instruments at December 31, 2011.  85  Note 6 - Employee Benefit Plans Oversight of Plans The Retirement Plan Investment Committee the Committee appointed by our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the investments of our defined benefit retirement plans. Further, we have an Investment Policy the Policy for our pension and other retirement benefit plans whose goal is to preserve these plans capital and maximize investment earnings in excess of inflation within acceptable levels of capital market volatility. To accomplish this goal, the plans assets are managed to optimize long-term return while maintaining a high standard of portfolio quality and diversification. We will continue to diversify retirement plan investments to minimize the risk of large losses in a single asset class. We do not have a concentration of assets in a single entity, industry, country, commodity or class of investment fund. The Policys permissible investments include domestic and international equities including convertible securities and mutual funds, domestic and international fixed income corporate and United States government obligations, cash and cash equivalents and other suitable investments. Equity market performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our reported funded status. Changes in the projected benefit obligation PBO and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation APBO are mainly driven by the assumed discount rate. Additionally, equity market performance has a significant effect on our market-related value of plan assets MRVPA, which is used by the AGL Retirement Plan, and on the actual fair market value of plan assets, which is used by the Nicor Gas Retirement Plan our two largest pension plans, to determine the expected return on the plan assets component of net annual pension cost. The MRVPA is a calculated value and differs from the actual market value of plan assets. Gains and losses on plan assets are spread through the MRVPA based on the five-year moving weighted average methodology. Nicor Gas pension and other retirement benefit costs have historically been considered in rate proceedings in the period they are accrued. As a regulated utility, Nicor Gas expects to continue rate recovery of the eligible costs of these defined benefit retirement plans and, accordingly, associated changes in the funded status of Nicor Gas plans have been deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until recognized in net income, instead of being recorded in accumulated OCI. However, to the extent Nicor Gas employees perform services for affiliates, and to the extent such employees are eligible to participate in these plans, the affiliates are charged for the cost of these benefits and changes in the funded status that are expected to be recovered from affiliates in the future are recorded in accumulated OCI. Pension Benefits We sponsor three tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plans for our eligible employees, the Nicor Gas Retirement Plan, the AGL Retirement Plan and the NUI Retirement Plan. A defined benefit plan specifies the amount of benefits an eligible participant eventually will receive using information about the participant. The Nicor Gas Retirement Plan is a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of Nicor Gas hired prior to 1998.Pension benefits are based on years of service and the highest average salary for management employees and job level for collectively bargained employees referred to as pension bands.The benefit obligation related to collectively bargained benefits considers the past practice of regular benefit increases. We generally calculate the benefits under the AGL Retirement Plan based on age, years of service and pay. The benefit formula for the AGL Retirement Plan is a career average earnings formula, except for participants who were employees as of July 1, 2000, and who were at least 50 years of age as of that date. For those participants, we used a final average earnings benefit formula, and used this benefit formula for such participants until December 31, 2010, at which time any of those participants who were still actively employed accrue future benefits under the career average earnings formula. Effective January 1, 2012, the AGL Retirement Plan was frozen with respect to participation for non-union employees hired on or after that date. Such employees will be entitled to employer provided benefits under their defined contribution plan, that exceed defined contributionbenefits for employees who participate in the defined benefit plan. The NUI Retirement Plan covers substantially all of NUI Corporations employees who were employed on or before December 31, 2005, except Florida City Gas union employees, who until February 2008 participated in a union-sponsored multiemployer plan. Pension benefits are based on years of credited service and final average compensation as of the plan freeze date. Effective January 1, 2006, participation and benefit accrual under the NUI Retirement Plan were frozen. As of that date, former participants in that plan became eligible to participate in the AGL Retirement Plan. Florida City Gas union employees became eligible to participate in the AGL Retirement Plan in February 2008.  86  Other Defined Benefit Retirement Benefits We sponsor two defined benefit retirement health care plans for our eligible employees, the Health and Welfare Plan for Retirees and Inactive Employees of AGL Resources Inc. AGL Welfare Plan and the Nicor Gas Welfare Benefit Plan. Eligibility for these benefits is based on age and years of service. The AGL Welfare Plan includes medical coverage for all eligible AGL Resources employees who were employed as of June 30, 2002, if they reach retirement age while working for us. In addition, the AGL Welfare Plan provides life insurance for all employees if they have ten years of service at retirement. The state regulatory commissions have approved phase-in plans that defer a portion of the related benefits expense for future recovery. Nicor Gas provides health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retired employees under the Nicor Gas Welfare Benefit Plan that includes a limit on its share of cost for employees hired after 1982. We recorded a regulatory asset for anticipated future recoveries of $291 million as of December 31, 2011 and $9 million as of December 31, 2010. In addition, we recorded a regulatory liability of $19 million as of December 31, 2011 and $6 million as of December 31, 2010 for our expected expenses under the AGL Welfare Plan and the Nicor Gas Welfare Benefit Plan. We expect to pay $21 million of insurance claims for these plans in 2012, but we do not anticipate making any additional contributions. Effective December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 was signed into law. This act provides for a prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. We determined that the Nicor Gas prescription drug benefits of its plan are actuarially equivalent and accordingly have reflected the effects of the subsidy in the determination of the benefit obligation and annual net benefit. Effective July 1, 2009, Medicare eligible retirees covered by the AGL Welfare Plan, including all of those at least age 65, receive benefits through our contribution to a retiree health reimbursement arrangement account. Effective January 1, 2010, enhancements were made to the pre-65 medical coverage of the AGL Welfare Plan by removing the current cap on our expected costs and implementing a new cap determined by the new retiree premium schedule based on salary level and years of service. Due to the cap, there is no impact on the periodic benefit cost or on our accumulated projected benefit obligation for the AGL Welfare Plan for a change in the assumed healthcare cost trend. We also have a separate unfunded supplemental retirement healthcare planthat provideshealth care and life insurance benefits to employees of discontinued businesses. This plan is noncontributory with defined benefits. Net plan expenses were immaterial in 2011. The PBO associated with this plan was $3 million December 31, 2011. Contributions Our employees generally do not contribute to these pension and other retirement plans, however, Nicor Gas and pre-65 AGL retirees make nominal contributions to their health care plan. We fund the qualified pension plans by contributing at least the minimum amount required by applicable regulations and as recommended by our actuary. However, we may also contribute in excess of the minimum required amount. As required by The Pension Protection Act of 2006 the Act, we calculate the minimum amount of funding using the traditional unit credit cost method. The Act contained new funding requirements for single employer defined benefit pension plans and established a 100% funding target over a 7-year amortization period for plan years beginning after December 31, 2007. If certain conditions were met, the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act of 2008 allowed us to measure our required minimum contributions based on a funding target of 100% in 2010 and 2011. In 2011 we contributed $56 million to the AGL Retirement Plan and the NUI Retirement Plan. In 2010 we contributed $31 million to the AGL Retirement Plan and the NUI Retirement Plan. No contributions were made to the Nicor Gas Retirement Plan in 2011. For more information on our 2012 contributions to our pension plans, see Note 11. Assumptions We consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We consider the historical long-term return experience of our assets, the current and expected allocation of our plan assets, and expected long-term rates of return. We derive these expected long-term rates of return with the assistance of our investment advisors and generally base these rates on the various asset classes, our expected investments of plan assets and asset management. We base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities, fixed income securities, real estate, private equity securities and alternative asset classes. We consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at December 31. We based our discount rate on a yield curve provided by our actuaries that is derived from a portfolio of high quality rated AA or better corporate bonds and the equivalent annuity cash flows separately for each pension plan.  87  The following tables present details about our pension and other retirement plans.

A portion of the net benefit cost or credit related to these plans has been capitalized as a cost of constructing gas distribution facilities and the remainder is included in gas distribution operation and maintenance expense, net of amounts charged to affiliates.  88  Assumptions used to determine the 2011 health care benefit cost for the Nicor Gas Welfare Benefit Plan were as follows   2011 Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 860 Ultimate rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline 450 Year that reaches ultimate trend rate 2030 Assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates for the Nicor Gas Welfare Benefit Plan would have the following effects Dollars in millions Effect on service and interest cost Effect on benefit obligation 1% Health care cost trend rate increase 0 26 1% Health care cost trend rate decrease 0 22 As a result of a cap on expected cost for the AGL Welfare Plan, a one-percentage-point increase or decrease in the assumed health care trend does not materially affect periodic benefit cost or accumulated benefit obligation of the Plan.

Accounting Treatment and Compensation Expense We measure and recognize stock-based compensation expense over the required service period in our financial statements based on the estimated fair value at the date of grant for our stock-based awards using the modified prospective, which include stock options stock awards performance units restricted stock units and performance cash units. Performance-based stock awards and performance units contain market conditions. Stock options, restricted stock awards and performance units also contain a service condition. We estimate forfeitures over the required service period when recognizing compensation expense. These estimates are adjusted to the extent that actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to materially differ, from such estimates. The authoritative guidance requires excess tax benefits to be reported as a financing cash inflow. The difference between the proceeds from the exercise of our stock-based awards and the par value of the stock is recorded within premium on common stock. We grant incentive and nonqualified stock options with a strike price equal to the fair market value on the date of the grant. Fair market value is defined under the terms of the applicable plans as the most recent closing price per share of AGL Resources common stock as reported in The Wall Street Journal. Stock options generally have a three-year vesting period. The following table provides additional information on compensation costs and income tax benefits and excess tax benefits related to our cash and stock-based compensation awards.  90  In millions 2011 2010 2009 Compensation costs 1 14 11 11 Income tax benefits 1 1 2 2 Excess tax benefits 2 1 2 2 1 Recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income. 2 Recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Incentive and Nonqualified Stock Options Nonqualified options generally expire 10 years after the date of grant. Participants realize value from option grants only to the extent that the fair market value of our common stock on the date of exercise of the option exceeds the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. As of December 31, 2011, we had an immaterial amount of unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options. Cash received from stock option exercises for 2011 was $11 million, and the income tax benefit from stock option exercises was $1 million. Intrinsic value for options is defined as the difference between the current market value and the grant price.

Otherwise, we issue new shares from our authorized common stock. Performance Units The compensation cost of restricted stock unit awards is equal to the grant date fair value of the awards, recognized over the required service period, determined according to the authoritative guidance related to stock compensation. The dollar value of performance cash unit awards is equal to the grant date fair value of the awards measured against progress towards the performance measure, recognized over the required service period, determined according to the authoritative guidance related to stock compensation. No other assumptions are used to value these awards. In general, a performance unit is an award of the right to receive i an equal number of shares of our common stock, which we refer to as a restricted stock unit or ii cash, subject to the achievement of certain pre-established performance criteria, which we refer to as a performance cash unit. Performance units are subject to certain transfer restrictions and forfeiture upon termination of employment. Restricted Stock UnitsIn general, a restricted stock unit is an award that represents the opportunity to receive a specified number of shares of our common stock, subject to the achievement of certain pre-established performance criteria. In 2011, we granted to a select group a total of 134,510 restricted stock units, of which 126,920 of these units were outstanding as of December 31, 2011. These restricted stock units had a performance measurement period that ended December 31, 2011, which was achieved, and a performance measure related to a basic earnings per common share attributable to AGL Resources Inc. common shareholders goal that was met. Performance Cash AwardsIn general, a performance cash award represents the opportunity to receive cash, subject to the achievement of certain pre-established performance criteria. In 2011, we did not grant any performance cash awards. These awards have a performance measure that is related to annual growth in basic earnings per common share attributable to AGL Resources Inc. common shareholders and the average dividend yield.

No other assumptions are used to value the awards. We refer to restricted stock as an award of our common stock that is subject to time-based vesting or achievement of performance measures. Restricted stock awards are subject to certain transfer restrictions and forfeiture upon termination of employment. Stock Awards Non-Employee DirectorsNon-employee director compensation may be paid in shares of our common stock in connection with initial election, the annual retainer, and chair retainers, as applicable. Stock awards for non-employee directors are 100% vested and nonforfeitable as of the date of grant.

Commercial Paper Programs We maintain commercial paper programs at AGL Capital and at Nicor Gas that consist of short-term, unsecured promissory notes that are used in conjunction with cash from operations to fund our seasonal working capital requirements. Working capital needs fluctuate during the year and are highest during the injection period in advance of the Heating Season. The Nicor Gas commercial paper program supports working capital needs at Nicor Gas, while our other subsidiaries, including SouthStar, participate in the AGL Capital commercial paper program. At December 31, 2011, our commercial paper maturities ranged from 3 to 58 days. AGL Credit Facility On November 10, 2011, AGL Capital amended and restated its revolving credit facility to extend the maturity date to November 10, 2016 and to increase the revolving credit commitments to $13 billion. This credit facility can be drawn upon to support the AGL Capital commercial paper program and to provide the flexibility to meet ongoing working capital and other general purpose needs. The interest rate payable on borrowings under the AGL Credit Facility is calculated either at the alternative base rate, plus an applicable margin, or LIBOR, plus an applicable interest margin. The applicable interest margin used in both interest rate calculations will vary according to AGL Capitals current credit ratings. At December 31, 2011, there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility. Nicor Gas Credit Facility On December 15, 2011, Nicor Gas entered into a $700 million revolving credit facility, which matures on December 15, 2016. The Nicor Gas Credit Facility replaced its previous three-year credit facility and 364-day facility and can be drawn upon to support the Nicor Gas commercial paper program and to provide the flexibility to meet ongoing working capital and other general purpose needs. The interest rate payable on borrowings under the Nicor Gas Credit Facility is calculated either at the alternative base rate, plus an applicable interest margin, or LIBOR, plus an applicable interest margin. The applicable interest margin used in both interest rate calculations will vary according to Nicor Gas current credit ratings. At December 31, 2011, there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility.  94  SouthStar Credit Facility SouthStars five-year $75 million unsecured credit facility expired on November 2,2011. SouthStar used this line of credit for working capital and general corporate needs. SouthStar had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit at December 31, 2010. Current Portion of Long-Term Debt We have $15 million of medium-term notes, which are reported as current portion of long-term debt on our December 31, 2011 Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Additionally, we had $300 million of senior notes, which are reported as current portion of long-term debt on our December 31, 2010 Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Current Portion of Capital Leases Our capital leases consist primarily of a sale/leaseback transaction of gas meters and other equipment that was completed in 2002 by Florida City Gas and will be repaid through 2012. Based on the terms of the lease agreement, Florida City Gas is required to insure the leased equipment during the lease term. At the expiration of the lease term, Florida City Gas has the option to purchase the leased meters from the lessor at their fair market value, which will be determined based on an arms-length transaction between an informed and willing buyer. Long-term Debt Our long-term debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010 consisted of medium-term notes: Series A, Series B, and Series C, which we issued under an indenture dated December 1, 1989, senior notes, first mortgage bonds, gas facility revenue bonds and capital leases. Some of these issuances were completed in the private placement market. In determining that those specific bonds qualify for exemption from registration under Section 42 of the Securities Act of 1933, we relied on the facts that the bonds were offered only to a limited number of large institutional investors and each institutional investor that purchased the bonds represented that it was purchasing the bonds for its own account and not with a view to distribute them. We fully and unconditionally guarantee all of our senior notes. Additionally, substantially all of Nicor Gas properties are subject to the lien of the indenture securing its first mortgage bonds. The majority of our long-term debt matures after fiscal year 2016. The annual maturities of our long-term debt for the next five years and thereafter are as follows Year Amount

The remaining proceeds were used for the cash consideration and expenses incurred in connection with the Nicor merger. 2 The net proceeds were used to pay a portion of the cash consideration and expenses incurred in connection with the Nicor merger. Following our issuances of these senior notes we terminated the Bridge Facility. Interest Rate Swaps On May 4, 2011, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $250 million to effectively convert a portion of our $300 million 64% fixed-rate senior notes that mature July 15, 2016 to a variable-rate obligation. Under the terms of the swaps, the interest rates reset quarterly based on LIBOR plus 39%. As of December 31, 2011, we also held forward-starting interest rate swaps totaling $90 million that were redesignated as cash flow hedges upon the close of the Nicor merger. Under the terms of the swaps, we agree to pay a fixed swap rate and receive a floating rate based on LIBOR. First Mortgage Bonds As a result of the merger, we acquired the first mortgage bonds of Nicor Gas, which at December 31, 2011, had principal balances totaling $500 million. The fair value step-up of these bonds on December 9, 2011, the merger closing date, was $99 million, a step up to fair value that is reflected in our long-term debt. Nicor Gashas issued first mortgage bonds through the public and private placement markets. Gas Facility Revenue BondsWe are party to a series of loan agreements with the New Jersey Economic Development Authority NJEDA under which the NJEDA has issued a series of gas facility revenue bonds. These gas revenue bonds are issued by state agencies or counties to investors, and proceeds from the issuance are then loaned to us. In June and September 2010, the letters of credit supporting the gas revenue bonds were set to expire, and according to the terms of the bond indentures, we repurchased the bonds before the expiration of the letters of credit using the proceeds of AGL Capital commercial paper issuances.  95  Financial and Non-Financial Covenants The AGL Credit Facility and the Nicor Gas Credit Facility include a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no more than 70%; however, our goal is to maintain this ratio at levels between 50% and 60%. These ratios, as calculated in accordance with our debt covenant includes standby letters of credit, surety bonds and excludes other comprehensive income pension adjustments. Adjusting for these items, the following table contains our debt-to-capitalization ratios for the periods presented, which are within our required and targeted ranges.  AGL Resources Nicor Gas

2011 2010 2011 2010  Debt-to-capitalization ratio 58 58 60 n/a The credit facilities contain certain non-financial covenants that, among other things, restrict liens and encumbrances, loans and investments, acquisitions, dividends and other restricted payments, asset dispositions, mergers and consolidations and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. We were in compliance with all existing debt provisions and covenants, both financial and non-financial, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Default Provisions Our credit facilities and other financial obligations include provisions that, if not complied with, could require early payment or similar actions. The most important default events include a maximum leverage ratio insolvency events and nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments acceleration of other financial obligations change of control provisions We have no trigger events in our debt instruments that are tied to changes in our specified credit ratings or our stock price and have not entered into any transaction that requires us to issue equity based on credit ratings or other trigger events. Preferred Securities At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had 10 million shares of authorized, unissued Class A junior participating preferred stock, no par value, and 10 million shares of authorized, unissued preferred stock, no par value.  96  Note 9 Equity Treasury Shares Our Board of Directors authorized us to purchase up to 8 million treasury shares through our repurchase plan which expired on January 31, 2011. This plan was used to offset shares issued under our employee and non-employee director incentive compensation plans and our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans. Stock purchases under this plan were made in the open market or in private transactions at times, and in amounts, that we deemed appropriate. We held the purchased shares as treasury shares and accounted for them using the cost method. In 2011, we spent $2 million to purchase less than01 million treasury shares at a weighted average price per share of $3625. In 2010, we spent $7 million to purchase approximately 02 million treasury shares at a weighted average price per share of $3601. Dividends Our common shareholders may receive dividends when declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Dividends may be paid in cash, stock or other form of payment, and payment of future dividends will depend on our future earnings, cash flow, financial requirements and other factors. As a result of the Nicor merger, AGL Resources shareholders on record as of the close of business on December 8, 2011, received a pro rata dividend for the stub period, accruing from November 19, 2011. Additionally, we derive a substantial portion of our consolidated assets, earnings and cash flow from the operation of regulated utility subsidiaries, whose legal authority to pay dividends or make other distributions to us is subject to regulation. As with most other companies, the payment of dividends is restricted by laws in the states where we conduct business. In certain cases, our ability to pay dividends to our common shareholders is limited by i our ability to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business and satisfy our obligations under certain financing agreements, including our debt-to-capitalization covenant, ii our ability to maintain total assets below total liabilities, and iii our ability to satisfy our obligations to any preferred shareholders. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Our comprehensive income loss includes net income and net income attributable to AGL Resources Inc. plus OCI, which includes changes in fair value of certain derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, certain changes in pension and other retirement benefit plans and reclassifications for amounts included in net income and net income attributable to AGL Resources Inc. For more information on our derivative instruments, see Note 5. For more information on our pensions and retirement benefit obligations, see Note 6. Our comprehensive income loss amounts are aggregated within our accumulated other comprehensive loss. The following table provides the components of our accumulated other comprehensive loss balances, net of the related tax effects allocated to each component of OCI.

2Income taxes for the years ending December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $41 million, $20 million and $10 million, respectively.  97  Note 10 Non-Wholly Owned Entities As of December 31, 2011, we had ownership interests in SouthStar, Triton, Horizon Pipeline and Sawgrass Storage. Variable Interest Entities On a quarterly basis we evaluate all of our owner interests to determine if they represent a variable interest entity VIE as defined by the authoritative accounting guidance on consolidation, and if so, which party is the primary beneficiary. We have determined that SouthStar, a joint venture owned by us and Piedmont, is the only VIE for which we are the primary beneficiary, which requires us to consolidate its assets, liabilities and Statements of Income. Earnings from SouthStar in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were allocated entirely in accordance with the ownership interests. We account for our ownership of SouthStar in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance which is fully described within Note 2. SouthStar markets natural gas and related services under the trade name Georgia Natural Gas to retail customers primarily in Georgia, and under various other trade names to retail customers in Ohio, Florida and New York and to commercial and industrial customers, principally in Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. The primary risks associated with SouthStar are discussed in our risk factors included in Item 1A. The following table illustrates the effect that our 2009 purchase of an additional 15% ownership percentage, which became effective in January 2010, had on our equity. In millions Premium on
common stock Accumulated other comprehensive loss Total Purchase of additional 15% ownership interest 51 1 52 Our conclusion that SouthStar is a VIE resulted from our equal voting rights with Piedmont not being proportional to our economic obligation to absorb 85% of losses or residual returns from the joint venture. Following are additional factors we considered in determining that we have the power to direct SouthStars activities that most significantly impact its performance.  Operations Our wholly owned subsidiary, Atlanta Gas Light, provides the following services in accordance with Georgia Commission authorization that affect SouthStars operations provides meter reading services for SouthStars customers in Georgia maintains and expands the natural gas infrastructure in Georgia markets the benefits of natural gas, performs outreach to residential and commercial developers, offers natural gas appliance rebates and billboard and print advertising, all of which support SouthStars efforts to maintain and expand its residential, commercial and industrial customers in its largest market, Georgia assigns storage and transportation capacity used in delivering natural gas to SouthStars customers Liquidity and capital resources we provide guarantees for SouthStars activities with its counterparties, its credit exposure and to certain natural gas suppliers in support of SouthStars payment obligations SouthStar utilizes the AGL Capital commercial paper program for its liquidity and working capital requirements. We support SouthStars daily cash management activities and assist with ensuring SouthStar has adequate liquidity and working capital resources Back office functions in accordance with our services agreement, we provide services to SouthStar with respect to accounting, information technology, credit and internal controls SouthStars financial results are seasonal in nature, with business depending to a great extent on the first and fourth quarters of each year. SouthStars current assets consist primarily of natural gas inventory, derivative instruments and receivables from its customers. SouthStar also has receivables from us due to its participation in AGL Capitals commercial paper program. See Note 2 for additional discussions of SouthStars inventories. SouthStars restricted assets consist of customer deposits and were immaterial as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. SouthStars current liabilities consist primarily of accrued natural gas costs, other accrued expenses, customer deposits, derivative instruments and payables to us from its participation in AGL Capitals commercial paper program.  98  As of December 31, 2011, SouthStars current assets, which approximate fair value, exceeded its current liabilities, long-term assets and other deferred debits, long-term liabilities and other deferred credits by approximately $56 million. SouthStars other contractual commitments and obligations, including operating leases and agreements with third party providers, do not contain terms that would trigger material financial obligations in the event that such contracts were terminated. As a result, our maximum exposure to a loss at SouthStar is considered to be immaterial. SouthStars creditors have no recourse to our general credit beyond our corporate guarantees we have provided to SouthStars counterparties and natural gas suppliers. We have provided no financial or other support that was not previously contractually required. With the exception of our corporate guarantees, we have not entered into any arrangements that could require us to provide financial support to SouthStar. Price and volume fluctuations of SouthStars natural gas inventories can cause significant variations in our working capital and cash flow from operations. Changes in our operating cash flows are also attributable to SouthStars working capital changes resulting from the impact of weather, the timing of customer collections, payments for natural gas purchases and cash collateral amounts that SouthStar maintains to facilitate its derivative instruments. Cash flows used in our investing activities include capital expenditures for SouthStar for the year ended December 31, of $2 million for 2011, $3 million for 2010 and $2 million for 2009. Cash flows used in our financing activities include SouthStars distribution to Piedmont for its portion of SouthStars annual earnings from the previous year. Generally, this distribution occurs in the first or second quarter of each fiscal year. For the year ended December 31, 2011, SouthStar distributed $16 million to Piedmont and $27 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease of $11 million was primarily the result of our increased ownership percentage of SouthStar in 2010. The following table provides additional information on SouthStars assets and liabilities as of the periods presented, which are consolidated within our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Equity Method Investments TritonWe have an investment in Triton, a cargo container leasing company. Container equipment that is acquired by Triton is accounted for in tranches as defined in Tritons operating agreement, and investors make capital contributions to Triton to invest in each of the tranches. As of December 31, 2011, we had invested in seven tranches established by Triton. Horizon PipelineWe have a50% owned joint venture with Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America that is regulated by the FERC. Horizon Pipeline operates an approximate 70 mile natural gas pipeline from Joliet, Illinois to near the Wisconsin/Illinois border. Nicor Gas typically contracts for 70% to 80% of the total capacity. Sawgrass Storage We have a 50% owned joint venture with Samson Contour Energy that is currently in its development stage. The purpose of the joint venture is to develop, operate and market the services of a natural gas storage and pipeline facility in Louisiana. Our investments that are accounted for under the equity method are as follows In millions 2011 Triton 76 Horizon Pipeline 18 Other 8 Total 102 Our net equity investment income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, was approximately $1 million. During the same period, we received an immaterial amount of dividends from our equity investees.  99  Note 11 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies We have incurred various contractual obligations and financial commitments in the normal course of our operating and financing activities that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Contractual obligations include future cash payments required under existing contractual arrangements, such as debt and lease agreements. These obligations may result from both general financing activities and from commercial arrangements that are directly supported by related revenue-producing activities. The following table illustrates our expected future contractual payments such as debt and lease agreements, and commitments as of December 31, 2011.  2017 In millions Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 thereafter Recorded contractual obligations  Long-term debt 1 3,431 0 225 0 200 545 2,461 Short-term debt 2 1,338 1,338 0 0 0 0 0 Pipeline replacement program costs 3 276 131 145 0 0 0 0 Environmental remediation liabilities 3 327 37 66 55 45 32 92 Total 5,372 1,506 436 55 245 577 2,553 Unrecorded contractual obligations and commitments4 9 10  Pipeline charges, storage capacity and gas supply 5 2,263 781 494 269 164 85 470 Interest charges 6 2,581 169 161 158 149 137 1,807 Operating leases 7 220 32 25 20 19 18 106 Asset management agreements 8 26 11 9 3 2 1 0 Standby letters of credit, performance surety bonds 9 22 18 4 0 0 0 0 Other 14 5 3 2 2 2 0 Total 5,126 1,016 696 452 336 243 2,383 1 Excludes the $99 million step up to fair value of first mortgage bonds, $18 million unamortized debt premium and $13 million interest rate swaps fair value adjustment. 2 Includes current portion of long-term debt of $15 million, which matures in June 2012 and current portion of capital leases. 3 Includes charges recoverable through rate rider mechanisms. 4 In accordance with GAAP, these items are not reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. 5 Includes charges recoverable through a natural gas cost recovery mechanism or alternatively billed to Marketers and demand charges associated with Sequent. The gas supply amount includes amounts for Nicor Gas and SouthStar gas commodity purchase commitments of 67 Bcf at floating gas prices calculated using forward natural gas prices as of December 31, 2011, and is valued at $222 million. As we do for other subsidiaries, we provide guarantees to certain gas suppliers for SouthStar in support of payment obligations. 6 Floating rate interest charges are calculated based on the interest rate as of December 31, 2011 and the maturity date of the underlying debt instrument. As of December 31, 2011, we have $61 million of accrued interest on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position that will be paid in 2012. 7 We have certain operating leases with provisions for step rent or escalation payments and certain lease concessions. We account for these leases by recognizing the future minimum lease payments on a straight-line basis over the respective minimum lease terms, in accordance with authoritative guidance related to leases. However, this lease accounting treatment does not affect the future annual operating lease cash obligations as shown herein. Our operating leases are primarily for real estate. 8 Represent fixed-fee minimum payments for Sequents affiliated asset management agreements. 9 We provide guarantees to certain municipalities and other agencies and certain gas suppliers of SouthStar in support of payment obligations. 10 Based on the current funding status of the plans, we would be required to make a minimum contribution to our pension plans of approximately $36 million in 2012. We may make additional contributions in 2012. Substitute Natural Gas On September 30, 2011, Nicor Gas signed an agreement to purchase approximately 25 Bcf of SNG annually for a 10-year term beginning as early as 2015. The counterparty intends to construct a 60 Bcf per year coal gasification plant in southern Illinois.The project is expected to be financed by the counterparty with external debt and equity.In addition, the final price of the SNG may exceed market prices and is dependent upon a variety of factors, including plant construction costs, and is not estimable.The price of the SNG under this contract could potentially be significantly more than market price. However, this agreement complies with an Illinois statute that authorizes full recovery of the purchase costs; therefore we expect to recover such costs.Since the purchase agreement is contingent upon various milestones to be achieved by the counterparty to the agreement, our obligation is not certain at this time.While the purchase agreement is a variable interest in the counterparty, we have concluded, based on a qualitative evaluation, that we are not the primary beneficiary required to consolidate the counterparty. No amount has been recognized on our Statement of Financial Position in connection with the purchase agreement.  100  On October 11, 2011, the Illinois Power Agency IPA approved the form of a draft 30-year contract for the purchase of 20 Bcf per year of SNG from a second proposed plant beginning as early as 2018.In November 2011, Nicor Gas filed a lawsuit against the IPA and the developer of this second proposed plant contending that the draft contract approved by the IPA does not conform to certain requirements of the enabling legislation. The lawsuit is pending in circuit court in DuPage County, Illinois. In accordance with the enabling legislation, the draft contract approved by the IPA for the second proposed plant was submitted to the Illinois Commission for further approvals by that regulatory body. The Illinois Commission issued an order on January 10, 2012 approving a final form of contract for the second plant. The final form of contract approved by the Illinois Commission modified the draft contract submitted by the IPA in various respects. Both we and the developer of the plant have filed applications for rehearing with the Illinois Commission seeking changes to the final form of contract it approved. The price of the SNG that may be produced from both of the coal gasification plants may significantly exceed market prices and is dependent upon a variety of factors, including plant construction costs, and is currently not estimable. Illinois laws provided that prices paid for SNG purchase from the plants are to be considered prudent and not subject to review or disallowance by the Illinois Commission. No amount has been recognized on our Statement of Financial Position in connection with this contract. Contingencies and Guarantees Contingent financial commitments, such as financial guarantees, represent obligations that become payable only if certain predefined events occur and include the nature of the guarantee and the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required of us as the guarantor. We have certain subsidiaries that enter into various financial and performance guarantees and indemnities providing assurance to third parties. Financial guarantees Tropic Equipment Leasing Inc. TEL, a wholly owned subsidiary, holds our interest in Triton and has an obligation to restore to zero any deficit in its equity account for income tax purposes in the unlikely event that Triton is liquidated and a deficit balance remains. This obligation continues for the life of the Triton partnerships and any payment is effectively limited to the assets of TEL, which were approximately $76 million at December 31, 2011. We believe the likelihood of any such payment by TEL is remote. No liability has been recorded for this obligation. Performance guarantees Nicor Services markets product warranty contracts that provide for the repair of heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment, natural gas lines and other appliances within homes. Revenues from these product warranty contracts are recognized ratably over the coverage period, and related repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. Indemnities In certain instances, we have undertaken to indemnify current property owners and others against costs associated with the effects and/or remediation of contaminated sites for which we may be responsible under applicable federal or state environmental laws, generally with no limitation as to the amount. These indemnifications relate primarily to ongoing coal tar cleanup, as discussed in Environmental Matters. We believe that the likelihood of payment under our other environmental indemnifications is remote. No liability has been recorded for such indemnifications. Environmental Matters We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. These laws and regulations require us to remove or remedy the effect on the environment of the disposal or release of specified substances at current and former operating sites. The following table provides more information on the costs related to remediation of our former operating sites. In millions Cost estimate range Amount recorded Expected costs over next twelve months Georgia and Florida 42 - $98 58 7 Illinois 134 - 216 134 19 New Jersey 124 - 174 124 9 North Carolina 10 - 16 11 2 Total 310 - $504 327 37 We have confirmed 14 former operating sites in Georgia and Florida where Atlanta Gas Light, or its predecessors, owned or operated all or part of these sites. As of December 31, 2011, the soil and sediment remediation program was substantially complete for all Georgia sites, except for a few remaining areas of recently discovered impact, although groundwater cleanup continues. Investigation is concluded for one phase of the Orlando, Florida site; however, the Environmental Protection Agency has not approved the cleanup plans. For elements of the Georgia and Florida sites where we still cannot provide engineering cost estimates, considerable variability remains in future cost estimates.  101  We have identified 6 former operating sites in New Jersey where Elizabethtown Gas owned or operated all or part of these sites. Material cleanups of these sites have not been completed nor are precise estimates available for future cleanup costs and therefore considerable variability remains in future cost estimates. We have also identified a site in North Carolina, which is subject to a remediation order by the North Carolina Department of Energy and Natural Resources, and there are no cost recovery mechanisms for the environmental remediation. We have identified 26 sites in Illinois for which wehave some responsibility.Nicor Gas and Commonwealth Edison Company are parties to an agreement to cooperate in cleaning up residue at many of these sites.The agreement allocates to Nicor Gas 5173% of cleanup costs for 23 sites, no portion of the cleanup costs for 14 other sites and 50% of general remediation program costs that do not relate exclusively to particular sites.In addition to the sites from the agreement with Commonwealth Edison Company there are 3 sites in which we have sole responsibility. Information regarding preliminary site reviews has been presented to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency for certain sites.More detailed investigations and remedial activities are complete, in progress or planned at many of these sites. Our ERC liabilities are customarily reported estimates of future remediation costs for our former operating sites that are contaminated based on probabilistic models of potential costs and on an undiscounted basis. However, we have not yet performed these probabilistic models for all of our sites in Illinois, which will be completed in 2012. The results of the detailed site-by-site investigations will determine the extent additional remediation is necessary and provide a basis for estimating additional future costs.As of December 31, 2011, we had recorded a liability in connection with these matters of $134 million.In accordance with Illinois Commission authorization, we have been recovering, and expect to continue to recover, these costs from our customers, subject to annual prudence reviews. Our ERC liabilities are included as a corresponding regulatory asset. These recoverable ERC assets are a combination of accrued ERC liabilities and recoverable cash expenditures for investigation and cleanup costs. We primarily recover these costs through rate riders and expect to collect $7 million in revenues over the next 12 months which is reflected as a current asset. We recovered $11 million in 2011, $13 million in 2010 and $20 million in 2009 from our ERC rate riders. Litigation We are involved in litigation arising in the normal course of business. Although in some cases the company is unable to estimate the amount of loss reasonably possible in addition to any amounts already recognized, it is possible that the resolution of these contingencies, either individually or in aggregate, will require the company to take charges against, or will result in reductions in, future earnings. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of these contingencies, either individually or in aggregate, could be material to earnings in a particular period but will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. SouthStar Litigation In February 2008, a class action lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of Fulton County in the State of Georgia against Georgia Natural Gas alleging that it charged its customers of variable rate plans prices for natural gas that were in excess of the published price, failed to give proper notice regarding the availability of potentially lower price plans and that it changed its methodology for computing variable rates. Georgia Natural Gas asserts that no violation of law or Georgia Commission rules has occurred. This lawsuit was dismissed in September 2008. The plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of the lawsuit and, in May 2009, the Georgia Court of Appeals reversed the lower courts order. In June 2009, Georgia Natural Gas filed a petition for reconsideration with the Georgia Supreme Court. In October 2009 the Georgia Supreme Court agreed to review the Court of Appeals decision. Accordingly, the Georgia Supreme Court held oral arguments in January 2010. In March 2010 the Georgia Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals decision. A settlement agreement was reached with the plaintiffs in December 2011. SouthStar asserts that no violation of law or Georgia Commission rules has occurred, however they agreed to settle in order to avoid the further expense and inconvenience of litigation. Litigation Related to the Nicor Merger We were named as a defendant in several class action lawsuits brought by purported Nicor shareholders challenging Nicors merger with us. The complaints alleged that we aided and abetted alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by Nicors Board of Directors. The shareholder actions sought, among other things, declaratory and injunctive relief, including orders enjoining the defendants from completing the merger and, in certain circumstances, damages. This lawsuit was settled on December 7, 2011. PBRProceeding Nicor Gas PBR plan for natural gas costs went into effect in 2000 and was terminated January 1, 2003.Under this plan, Nicor Gas total gas supply costs were compared to a market-sensitive benchmark.Savings and losses relative to the benchmark were determined annually and shared equally with sales customers.The PBR plan is currently under review by the Illinois Commission as there are allegations that Nicor Gas acted improperly in connection with the PBR plan. On June 27, 2002, the Citizens Utility Board CUB filed a motion to reopen the record in the Illinois Commissions proceedings to review the PBR plan the Illinois Commission Proceedings.As a result of the motion to reopen, Nicor Gas, the staff of the Illinois Commission and CUB entered into a stipulation providing for additional discovery.The Illinois Attorney Generals Office IAGO has also intervened in this matter.In addition, the IAGO issued Civil Investigation Demands CIDs to CUB and the Illinois Commission staff.The CIDs ordered that CUB and the Illinois Commission staff produce all documents relating to any claims that Nicor Gas may have presented, or caused to be presented, false information related to its PBR plan.We have committed to cooperate fully in the reviews of the PBR plan.  102  The Nicor Board of Directors directed management to, among other things, make appropriate adjustments to account for, and fully address, the adverse consequences to ratepayers, and conduct a detailed study of the adequacy of internal accounting and regulatory controls.The adjustments were made in prior years financial statements resulting in a $25 million liability.Included in this $25 million liability is a $4 million loss contingency.A $2 million adjustment to the previously recorded liability, which is discussed below, was made in 2004 increasing the recorded liability to $27 million. By the end of 2003, we completed steps to correct the weaknesses and deficiencies identified in the detailed study of the adequacy of internal controls. On February 5, 2003, CUB filed a motion for $27 million in sanctions against Nicor Gas in the Illinois Commission Proceedings.In that motion, CUB alleged that Nicor Gas responses to certain CUB data requests were false.Also on February 5, 2003, CUB stated in a press release that, in addition to $27 million in sanctions, it would seek additional refunds to consumers.On March 5, 2003, the Illinois Commission staff filed a response brief in support of CUBs motion for sanctions.On May 1, 2003, the Administrative Law Judges assigned to the proceeding issued a ruling denying CUBs motion for sanctions.CUB has filed an appeal of the motion for sanctions with the Illinois Commission, and the Illinois Commission has indicated that it will not rule on the appeal until the final disposition of the Illinois Commission Proceedings.It is not possible to determine how the Illinois Commission will resolve the claims of CUB or other parties to the Illinois Commission Proceedings. In 2004, Nicor Gas became aware of additional information relating to the activities of individuals affecting the PBR plan for the period from 1999 through 2002, including information consisting of third party documents and recordings of telephone conversations from Entergy-Koch Trading, LP EKT, a natural gas, storage and transportation trader and consultant with whom Nicor Gas did business under the PBR plan.Review of additional information completed in 2004 resulted in the $2 million adjustment to the previously recorded liability referenced above. The evidentiary hearings on this matter were stayed in 2004 in order to permit the parties to undertake additional third party discovery from EKT.In December 2006, the additional third party discovery from EKT was obtained and the Administrative Law Judge issued a scheduling order that provided for Nicor Gas to submit direct testimony by April 13, 2007.Nicor Gas submitted direct testimony in April 2007, rebuttal testimony in April 2011 and surrebuttal testimony in December 2011. In surrebuttal testimony, we sought $6 million, which included interest due to us of $2 million, as of December 31, 2011.The staff of the Illinois Commission, IAGO and CUB submitted direct testimony to the Illinois Commission in April 2009 and rebuttal testimony in October 2011. In rebuttal testimony, the staff of the Illinois Commission, IAGO and CUB requested refunds of $85 million, $255 million and $305 million, respectively. In February 2012, we committed to astipulated resolution of issues with the staff of the Illinois Commission, which includes creditingNicor Gas customers $64 million, but does not constitute an admission of fault. This resulted in a $37 million adjustment to the previously recorded $27 million liability referenced above. The stipulatedresolution is not final and is subject to review and approval by the Illinois Commission. The CUB and IAGO are not parties to thestipulated resolution and continue to pursue their claims in the proceeding. Evidentiary hearings on this matterare scheduled to begin on February 28, 2012. The $64 million proposed credit is consistent with the estimated liability we recorded for this matter as part of our accounting for the merger with Nicor. We are unable to predict the outcome of the Illinois Commissions review or our potential exposure thereunder.Since the PBR plan and historical gas costs are still under Illinois Commission review, the final outcome could be materially different than the amounts reflected in our financial statements as of December 31, 2011. Nicor Services Warranty Product Actions In the first quarter of 2011, three putative class actions were filed against Nicor Services and Nicor Gas, and in one case against Nicor. In September 2011, the three cases were consolidated into a single class action pending in state court in Cook County, Illinois. The plaintiffs purport to represent a class of customers of Nicor Gas who purchased appliance warranty and service plans from Nicor Services and/or a class of customers of Nicor Gas who purchased the Gas Line Comfort Guard product from Nicor Services. In the consolidated action, the plaintiffs variously allege that the marketing, sale and billing of the Nicor Services appliance warranty and service plans and Gas Line Comfort Guard violate the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, constitute common law fraud and result in unjust enrichment of Nicor Services and Nicor Gas. The plaintiffs seek, on behalf of the classes they purport to represent, actual and punitive damages, interest, costs, attorney fees and injunctive relief. While we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters or to reasonably estimate our potential exposure related thereto, if any, and have not recorded a liability associated with this contingency, the final disposition of this matter is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our liquidity or financial condition.  103  Municipal Tax Matters Many municipalities in Nicor Gas service territory have enacted ordinances that impose taxes on gas sales to customers within municipal boundaries.Most of these municipal taxes are imposed on Nicor Gas based on revenues generated by Nicor Gas within the municipality.Other municipal taxes are imposed on natural gas consumers within the municipality but are collected from consumers and remitted to the municipality by us.A number of municipalities have instituted audits of Nicor Gas tax remittances.In May 2007, five of those municipalities filed an action against Nicor Gas in state court in DuPage County, Illinois relating to these tax audits.Following a dismissal of this action without prejudice by the trial court, the municipalities filed an amended complaint.The amended complaint seeks, among other things, compensation for alleged unpaid taxes.We are contesting the claims in the amended complaint.In December 2007, 25 additional municipalities, all represented by the same audit firm involved in the lawsuit, issued assessments to Nicor Gas claiming that it failed to provide information requested by the audit firm and owed the municipalities back taxes.We believe the assessments are improper and have challenged them.While we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters or to reasonably estimate our potential exposure related thereto, if any, and have not recorded a liability associated with this contingency, the final disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our liquidity or financial condition. On February 8, 2010, the IAGO issued a subpoena to Nicor Gas to provide documents in connection with an IAGO investigation pursuant to the Illinois Whistleblower Reward and Protection Act. On November 30, 2010, the IAGO issued Nicor Gas an amended request for information. According to the subpoena, the IAGO investigation relates to billing practices used with certain customer accounts involving government funds. While we believe the billing practices comply with Illinois Commission requirements, we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter or reasonably estimate its potential exposure, if any, and have not recorded a liability associated with this matter. Other In addition to the matters set forth above, we are involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and agencies with respect to general claims, taxes, environmental, gas cost prudence reviews and other matters.Although unable to determine the ultimate outcome of these other contingencies, we believe that these amounts are appropriately reflected in our financial statements, including the recording of appropriate liabilities when reasonably estimable. Note 12 - Income Taxes Income Tax Expense The relative split between current and deferred taxes is due to a variety of factors including true ups of prior year tax returns, and most importantly, the timing of our property-related deductions. Components of income tax expense shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income are shown in the following table. In millions 2011 2010 2009 Current income taxes Federal 89 37 23 State 1 12 8 Deferred income taxes Federal 196 86 94 State 18 6 11 Amortization of investment tax credits 1 1 1 Total 125 140 135 The reconciliations between the statutory federal income tax rate, the effective rate and the related amount of tax for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 on our Consolidated Statements of Income are presented in the following table.

We report the tax effects of the differences in those items as deferred income tax assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. We measure the assets and liabilities using income tax rates that are currently in effect. Because of the regulated nature of the utilities business, we recorded a regulatory tax liability in accordance with authoritative guidance related to rate-regulated entities, which we are amortizing over approximately 30 years see Note 2. Our deferred tax assets include $137 million related to an unfunded pension and other retirement benefit obligation, an increase of $43 million from 2010. We have provided a valuation allowance for some of these items that reduce our net deferred tax assets to amounts we believe are more likely than not to be realized in future periods. With respect to our continuing operations, we have net operating losses in various jurisdictions. Components that give rise to the net accumulated deferred income tax liability are as follows.  As of December 31 In millions 2011 2010 Accumulated deferred income tax liabilities Property accelerated depreciation and other property-related items 1,418 863 Mark to market 22 11 Investments in partnerships 42 0 Other 91 0 Acquisition intangibles 34 0 Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 39 0 Total accumulated deferred income tax liabilities 1,646 874 Accumulated deferred income tax assets Deferred investment tax credits 10 4 Unfunded pension and other retirement benefit obligation 137 94 Other 57 11 Total accumulated deferred income tax assets 204 109 Valuation allowances 1 3 3 Total accumulated deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance 201 106 Net accumulated deferred tax liability 1,445 768 1 Valuation allowance is due to the net operating losses on a former non-operating subsidiary that are not allowed in New Jersey. To the extent foreign cargo shipping earnings are not repatriated to the United States, such earnings are not currently subject to taxation. In addition, to the extent such earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore, no deferred income tax expense is recorded by us. At December 31, 2011, we had approximately $39 million of deferred income tax liabilities related to approximately $104 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. We have not recorded deferred income taxes of approximately $31 million on approximately $89 million of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings. Tax Benefits As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, we did not have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. Based on current information, we do not anticipate that this will change materially in 2012. As of December 31, 2011, we did not have a liability recorded for payment of interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions. We file a United States federal consolidated income tax return and various state income tax returns. We are no longer subject to income tax examinations by the Internal Revenue Service or in any state for years before 2007.  105  Note 13 - Segment Information Our operating segments comprise revenue-generating components of our company for which we produce separate financial information internally that we regularly use to make operating decisions and assess performance. Our determination of reportable segments considers the strategic operating units under which we manage sales of various products and services to customers in differing regulatory environments. We manage our businesses through five operating segments distribution operations, retail operations, wholesale services, midstream operations, cargo shipping and one non-operating segment, other. Our distribution operations segment is the largest component of our business and includes natural gas local distribution utilities in seven states - Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, New Jersey, Florida, Tennessee and Maryland. These utilities construct, manage, and maintain intrastate natural gas pipelines and distribution facilities. Although the operations of our distribution operations segment are geographically dispersed, the operating subsidiaries within the distribution operations segment are regulated utilities, with rates determined by individual state regulatory commissions. These natural gas distribution utilities have similar economic and risk characteristics. We are also involved in several related and complementary businesses. Our retail operations segment includes retail natural gas marketing to end-use customers primarily in Georgia as well as various businesses that market retail energy-related products and services to residential and small business customers in Illinois. Additionally, our retail operations segment provides warranty protection solutions to customers and customer move connection services for utilities. Our wholesale services segment includes natural gas asset management and related logistics activities for each of our utilities as well as for nonaffiliated companies, natural gas storage arbitrage and related activities. Our midstream operations segment includes the development and operation of high-deliverability natural gas storage assets. Our cargo shipping segment transports containerized freight between Florida, the eastern coast of Canada, the Bahamas and the Caribbean region. The cargo shipping segment also includes amounts related to cargo insurance coverage sold to its customers and other third parties. The cargo shipping segments vessels are under foreign registry, and its containers are considered instruments of international trade.Although the majority of its long-lived assets are foreign owned and its revenues are derived from foreign operations, the functional currency is generally the United States dollar. Our cargo shipping segment also includes an equity investment in Triton, a cargo container leasing business. Profits and losses are generally allocated to investors capital accounts in proportion to their capital contributions. Our investment in Triton is accounted for under the equity method, and our share of earnings are reported within Other Income on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our other segment includes intercompany eliminations and aggregated subsidiaries that are not significant enough on a stand-alone basis and that do not fit into one of our other five operating segments. We evaluate segment performance using the non-GAAP measure of EBIT, that includes operating income, other income and expenses, and equity investment income. Items we do not include in EBIT are income taxes and financing costs, including interest and debt expense, each of which we evaluate on a consolidated basis. We believe EBIT is a useful measurement of our performance because it provides information that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our businesses from an operational perspective, exclusive of the costs to finance those activities and exclusive of income taxes, neither of which is directly relevant to the efficiency of those operations. You should not consider EBIT an alternative to, or a more meaningful indicator of, our operating performance than operating income or net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our EBIT may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company. The reconciliations of EBIT to operating income, earnings before income taxes and net income for 2011, 2010 and 2009 are presented below. In millions 2011 2010 2009 Operating income 440 500 476 Other expense income 7 1 9 EBIT 447 499 485 Interest expense 136 109 101 Earnings before income taxes 311 390 384 Income taxes 125 140 135 Net income 186 250 249 Summarized Statements of Income, Statements of Financial Position and capital expenditure information by segment as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are shown in the following tables. Please note that our segments have changed as a result of our merger with Nicor and amounts from the periods presented have been reclassified between the segments to reflect these changes.  106  2011 In millions Distribution operations Retail operations Wholesale services Midstream operations Cargo

Item 1B. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Conclusions Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule13a-15e promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act. No system of controls, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of controls are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide assurance that the system of controls has operated effectively in all cases. Our disclosure controls and procedures however are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2011, in providing a reasonable level of assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods in SEC rules and forms, including a reasonable level of assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Other than changes resulting from the Nicor merger discussed below, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2011, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. On December 9, 2011, we completed our merger with Nicor. As permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, management has elected to exclude Nicor from managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2011. Reports of Management and Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management has assessed, and our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited, our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. The unqualified reports of management and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP thereon are included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated by reference herein. ITEM 9B.
