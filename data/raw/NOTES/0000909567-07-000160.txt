ITEM 8FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Consolidated Balance Sheets as at December31, 2006, and 2005 and the Consolidated Statements
of Income, Retained Earnings and Cash Flow for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005, and 2004,
reported on by KPMG LLP, Chartered Accountants. These statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States and in Canada. A
reconciliation of the differences between United States and Canadian GAAP is included on Note 17 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company are the responsibility of management and
have been prepared in accordance with Unites States GAAP with a reconciliation to Canadian GAAP
and, where appropriate, reflect estimates based on managements judgement. In addition, all other
information contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K is also the responsibility of management. The Company maintains systems of internal accounting and administrative controls designed to
provide reasonable assurance that the financial information provided is accurate and complete and
that all assets are properly safeguarded. The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that management fulfills its responsibility
for financial reporting and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving the Consolidated
Financial Statements. The Board appoints the Audit Committee, comprised of non-management
directors, which meets with management and KPMG LLP, the external auditors, at least once a year to
review, among other things, accounting policies, annual financial statements, the result of the
external audit examination, and the management discussion and analysis included in the Annual
Report on Form 10-K. The Audit Committee reports its finding to the Board of Directors so that the
Board may properly approve the financial statements. Additional commentary on corporate
governance appears in the Companys proxy statement for the 2007 Annual Meeting of its Shareholders
and the information therein is incorporated herein by reference. 26 Table of Contents INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AUDITORS REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Vitran Corporation Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vitran Corporation Inc. as of
December31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders
equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2006. Our
audit also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index under PartIV, a2. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Vitran Corporation Inc. as of December31, 2006 and
2005, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, on January1, 2006, Vitran
Corporation Inc. changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation in accordance with
guidance provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Share Based
Payments. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the effectiveness of Vitran Corporation Inc.s internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, and our report dated February7, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on

reporting. s/ KPMG LLP Toronto, Canada

Description of the business   
Vitran Corporation Inc. Vitran or the Company is a North American provider of
freight services and distribution solutions to a wide variety of companies and industries.
Vitran offers less-than-truckload LTL service throughout Canada and the United
States. Vitran Logistics offers supply chain solutions in Canada and the United States,
including warehousing, inventory management and flow-through distribution facilities, as
well as freight brokerage services. Vitran also provides same-day and next-day truckload
services in the United States.   
b
Basis of presentation   
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly
owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated on consolidation.   
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United
States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP with a reconciliation to Canadian
generally accepted accounting principles in note 17. The Ontario Business Corporations
Act OBCA regulations allow issuers that are required to file reports with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States to file financial statements under
United States GAAP to meet their continuous disclosure obligations in Canada. Prior to
2006, Vitran prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with Canadian
GAAP with a reconciliation to United States GAAP.   
All amounts in these consolidated financial statements are expressed in United States
dollars, unless otherwise stated.   
c
New accounting pronouncements   
SFAS Statement 155 amends SFAS Statement 133, Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging
Activities, and SFAS Statement 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial
Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, and allows an entity to remeasure at fair value
a hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would
require bifurcation from the host, if the holder irrevocably elects to account for the
whole instrument on a fair value basis. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the
instrument would be recognized in income. SFAS Statement 155 will be adopted January1,
2007 as required by the statement. The requirements of SFAS Statement 155 are not
expected to have an effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 33 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

Significant accounting policies continued   
SFAS Statement 156 amends SFAS Statement 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, with respect to the accounting for
separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. The Statement addresses
the recognition and measurement of separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities
and provides an approach to simplify efforts to obtain hedge-like offsetaccounting.
SFAS 156 will be adopted January1, 2007 as required by the statement. The requirements
of SFAS 156 are not expected to have an effect on the Companys consolidated financial
statements.   
SFAS Statement 157, Fair Value Measurements, defines fair values, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value in GAAP, and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value
measurements. This statement applies when other accounting pronouncements require or
permit fair value measurements. SFAS Statement 157 will be adopted January1, 2008 as
required by the statement.   
SFAS Statement 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Post-retirement Plans an amendment of SFAS Statements 87, 88, 106 and 132R, requires
an employer to recognize in its balance sheet the overfunded or underfunded status of a
defined benefit post-retirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of
the plan assets and the benefit obligation. Employers must also recognize as a component
of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial and experience gains and losses
and the prior service costs and credits. SFAS Statement 158 will be adopted January1,
2007 as required by the statement. The requirements of SFAS Statement 158 are not
expected to have an effect on the consolidated financial statements.   
FASB Interpretation No48 FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an
interpretation of FASB Statement 109, clarifies the criteria for recognizing tax benefits
under FASB Statement 109. It also requires additional financial statement disclosures
about uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 will be adopted January1, 2007 as required by the
FIN. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of FIN 48 on the Companys
consolidated financial statements.   
d
Foreign currency translation   
A majority of the Companys shareholders, customers and industry analysts are located in
the United States. Accordingly, the Company has adopted the United States dollar as its
reporting currency.   
The United States dollar is the functional currency of the Companys operations in the
United States. The Canadian dollar is the functional currency of the Companys Canadian
operations.   
Each operation translates foreign currency-denominated transactions into its functional
currency using the rate of exchange in effect at the date of the transaction. 34 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued
In thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts where noted Years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004   1.
Significant accounting policies continued   
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into the
functional currency of the operation using the year-end rate of exchange giving rise to a
gain or loss which is recognized in income during the current period.   
For reporting purposes, the Canadian operations are translated into United States dollars
using the current rate method. Under this method, all assets and liabilities are
translated at the year-end rate of exchange and all revenue and expense items are
translated at the average rate of exchange for the year. The resulting translation
adjustment is recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity. United States
dollar debt of $852million 2005 $114million is designated as a hedge of the
investment in the United States dollar functional operation, such that related transaction
gains and losses are recorded in the separate component of shareholders equity.   
In respect of other transactions denominated in currencies other than the Canadian dollar,
the monetary assets and liabilities of the Company are translated at the year-end rates.
Revenue and expenses are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the transaction
dates. All of the exchange gains or losses resulting from these other transactions are
recognized in income.   
e
Revenue recognition   
The Companys less-than-truckload, truckload business units and freight brokerage
operations recognize revenue upon the delivery of the related freight and direct shipment
costs as incurred. Revenue for the logistics operations is recognized as the management
services are provided.   
f
Accounts receivable   
Accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $22million
at December31, 2006 
2005 $13million.

Cash and cash equivalents   
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on account and short-term investments with
maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and are stated at cost, which
approximates market value.

Inventory   
Inventory consists of tires and spare parts and is valued at the lower of average cost and
replacement cost. 35 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

Property and equipment   
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is
provided on a straight-line basis from the date assets are put in service over their
estimated useful lives as follows   
Buildings

5-10 years   
Tires purchased as part of a vehicle are capitalized as a cost to the vehicle.
Replacement tires are expensed when placed in service.   
j
Goodwill and intangible assets   
As at September30, 2006 and September30, 2005, the Company completed its annual goodwill
impairment test and concluded there was no impairment. The change in goodwill is
attributable to translating the Canadian dollar-denominated goodwill to the United States
dollar reporting currency and to the acquisition of a subsidiary and acquisition of a
business. note 2.   
Intangible assets consist of not-to-compete covenants and customer relationships and are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected lives ranging from three to eight
years.   
k
Income taxes   
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the
asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in income in the year that includes the date of enactment. 36 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

Share-based compensation   
Under the Companys stock option plan, options to purchase common shares of the Company
may be granted to key employees, officers and directors of the Company by the Board of
Directors or by the Companys Compensation Committee. There are 767,700 options
outstanding under the plan. The term of each option is 10years and the vesting period is
generally five years. The exercise price for options is the trading price of the Common
Shares of the Company on the Toronto Stock Exchange on the day of the grant.   
For all stock option grants prior to January1, 2003, share-based compensation to
employees were accounted for based on the intrinsic value method under APB No25 and
related interpretations. On January1, 2003, in accordance with a transitional option
permitted under amended SFAS 148, the Company had prospectively applied the
fair-value-based method to all stock options granted on or after January1, 2003. The
Company recognized share-based compensation for all stock options granted on or after
January1, 2003 and presented the disclosures required by SFAS 123.   
On January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payments, using the
modified prospective transition method. In accordance with the modified prospective
transition method, the consolidated financial statements have not been restated to reflect
the impact of SFAS 123R.   
Under SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective method, compensation expense is
recognized for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of,
January1, 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
original provisions of SFAS 123 and compensation expense is recognized for all share-based
payments granted on or after January1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated

Impairment of long-lived assets   
An impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and
used exceeds the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected from its use and disposal, and is
measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
A long-lived asset should be tested when events or circumstances indicate that its
carrying amount may not be recoverable. During 2006 and 2005, the Company has not
identified any indicators that would require testing for an impairment.   
o
Derivative instruments   
Derivative instruments are used to hedge the Companys exposure to changes in interest
rates. All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value
based on quoted market prices and are recorded in either current or non-current assets or
liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fair values of derivatives are
recorded in income or other comprehensive income, based on whether the instrument is
designated as a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. Gain or
losses on derivative instruments reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified
to income in the period the hedged item affects income. If the underlying hedged
transaction ceases to exist, any associated amounts reported in other comprehensive income
are reclassified into income at that time. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in income in
the current period.   
p
Claims and insurance accruals   
Claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated total cost of claims, including
amounts for claims incurred but not reported, for cargo loss and damage, bodily injury and
property damage, workers compensation, long-term disability and group health. In Canada
and the United States, the Company has self-insurance retention amounts per incident for
auto liability, casualty and cargo claims. In the United States, the Company has
self-insurance retention amounts per incident for workers compensation and employee
medical. In establishing these accruals, management evaluates and monitors each claim
individually, and uses factors such as historical experience, known trends and third party
estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability. 38 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

Deferred share units   
The Company maintains a deferred share unit plan DSU for all directors. Under this
plan, all directors receive units at the end of each quarter based on the market price of
common shares equivalent to Cdn. $2,50000. The Company records compensation expense and
the corresponding liability each period initially for Cdn. $2,50000 and subsequently
based on changes in the market price of common shares.   
In addition to the Directors DSU plan, commencing January1, 2006, the Company adopted a
DSU plan for senior executives. Under this plan, eligible senior executives receive units
at the end of each quarter based on the market price of common shares equivalent to the
senior executives entitlement. The entitlement amount varies based on the senior
executives position in the Company and the years of eligible service. The maximum
entitlement amount varies between $2,50000 and $20,00000 per annum. The Company records
compensation expense and the corresponding liability each period based on the market price
of common shares.   
s
Use of estimates   
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the year. These include and are not limited to,
allowance for doubtful accounts, claims and insurance accruals, fair value of reporting
units for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing and useful lives of property and
equipment. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 39 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

On October2, 2006, the Company assumed a variable-to-fixed interest rate swap on variable
rate debt assumed as part of the PJAX acquisition. The swap is accounted for as a cash flow
hedge. Effectiveness is assessed based on the perfectly effective hypothetical derivative
method. Amounts deferred to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income are reclassified into
income over the life of the associated debt. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was nil in
2006. At December31, 2006, the notional amount of the swap was $39million, with the
average pay rate being 299% and the average receive rate being 53%. The swap matures in
September2010.

Financial instruments   
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and
accrued liabilities approximate the carrying values because of the short-term nature of these
instruments. The fair value of the Companys long-term debt, determined based on the future
cash flows associated with each debt instrument discounted using an estimate of the Companys
current borrowing rate for similar debt instruments of comparable maturity, is approximately
equal to the carrying values at December31, 2006 and 2005. 53 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

Total rental expense under operating leases was $163million for the year ended December31,
2006 2005 $173million; 2004 $167million.   
The Company has guaranteed a portion of the residual values of certain assets under operating
leases. If the market value of the assets at the end of the lease terms is less than the
guaranteed residual value, the Company must, under certain circumstances, compensate the
lessor for a portion of the shortfall. The maximum exposure under these guarantees is $37
million.   
15.
Employee benefits   
The Company sponsors defined contribution plans in Canada and the United States. In Canada,
the Company matches the employees contribution to their registered retirement savings plan up
to a maximum contribution. In the United States, the Company sponsors 401k savings plans.
The Company matches a percentage of the employees contribution subject to a maximum
contribution. The expense related to the plans was $20million for the year ended December
31, 2006 2005 $16million.   
16.
Contingent liabilities   
The Company is subject to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. In
the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to these actions,
will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. Legal costs are expensed as incurred. 54 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

United States and Canadian accounting policy differences   
In accordance with the provisions of the OBCA, issuers that are required to file reports with
the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States are allowed to file financial
statements under United States GAAP to meet their continuous disclosure obligations in Canada.
Vitran has included a reconciliation highlighting the material differences between its
consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with United States GAAP compared to
its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP as described
below. This disclosure is required for a finite period of time under the Ontario Securities
Commission regulations, subsequent to the adoption of United States GAAP. Prior to 2006,
Vitran prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with Canadian GAAP with a
reconciliation to United States GAAP.

United States and Canadian accounting policy differences continued   
i
The adoption of SFAS 123R Share-Based Payments as described in note
1l only applies to United States GAAP. Therefore, the effect of a change in
accounting principle does not impact Canadian GAAP net income.   
ii
The Company had foreign exchange gains of $09million that did not
represent a substantially complete liquidation of a foreign operation. Under
Canadian GAAP, these gains were recognized upon the transfer into income of the
related cumulative translation adjustment. Under United States GAAP, there is no
reduction of the cumulative translation adjustment account. Retained earnings under
Canadian GAAP is increased by $09million with a corresponding decrease to the
cumulative translation adjustment.   
iii
The concept of Comprehensive Income is not currently a requirement under
Canadian GAAP. The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants CICA has issued a
new accounting standard Comprehensive Income, which the Company will adopt effective
January1, 2007.

Share-based compensation   
Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R as described in note 1l.
SFAS 123R requires compensation expense be recognized for all share-based payments
granted prior to, but not yet vested, as of January1, 2006, based on the grant date fair
value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123. This is not
required under Canadian GAAP based on the transitional provision of CICA HB S3870 which
Vitran adopted January1, 2003. Canadian GAAP requires pro forma net income and income
per share disclosure for stock option grants during 2002. 56 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

The following table outlines the impact if the compensation cost for the Companys stock
options granted from January1, 2002 through to December31, 2002 were determined under
the fair value-based method. The Company has applied the pro forma disclosure provisions
of the standard to these awards. The pro forma effect of awards granted prior to January

Derivative accounting   
Under Canadian GAAP, gain and losses on derivatives that are designated as hedges and
that manage the underlying risks of anticipated transactions are not recorded until the
underlying hedged item is recorded in net income and hedge ineffectiveness is not
recorded until settlement. Under United States GAAP, for cash flow hedges, the effective
portion of the gains or losses is reported as component of other comprehensive income and
the ineffective portion is reported in net income from continuing operations immediately.
The CICA has issued a new accounting standard, Hedging, which the Company will adopt
January1, 2007.

Held-to-maturity, Loan and Receivables, Held-for-trading or Available-for-sale.   
iii
Hedging   
This section establishes standards for when and how hedge accounting may be applied.
The standard specifies criteria under which hedge accounting can be applied and how
hedge accounting can be executed for each of the permitted hedging strategies: fair
value hedges, cash flow hedges and hedges of foreign currency exposure of a net
investment in a self-sustaining foreign operation. 58 Table of Contents Consolidated Supplemental Schedule of Quarterly Financial Information
