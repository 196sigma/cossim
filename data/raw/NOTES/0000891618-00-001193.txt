REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
TelCom Semiconductor, Inc.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TelCom
Semiconductor, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States, which require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

NOTE 1 -- THE COMPANY AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION   TelCom Semiconductor, Inc. TelCom or the Company designs, develops
and markets a diversified portfolio of high performance analog integrated
circuits for use in a wide variety of electronic systems. The Company was
organized in Delaware in June 1993 and began operations in December 1993 after
the management-led buyout of the semiconductor operations of Teledyne, Inc. The
Company has operations in the United States, Hong Kong and Germany. The Company
operates and reports financial results on a 52-53 week fiscal year. During 1997,
the Company changed its fiscal year end from the last Friday of December to the
Friday closest to the last day of December. Fiscal year 1997 is a 53 week year
ended on January 2, 1998. Fiscal 1998 and 1999 are 52 week years ended on
January 1, 1999 and December 31, 1999, respectively. For convenience, the
Company presents its fiscal years as ending on December 31.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
NOTE 2 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from product sales to customers other than domestic distributors is
recognized upon shipment. Sales to domestic distributors are generally subject
to agreements allowing certain rights of return and price protection with
respect to unsold merchandise held by each distributor. The Company defers
recognition of revenue and related gross margin on the sales to domestic
distributors until the product is sold by these distributors.
SALES TO SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS
Sales to one customer represented 30%, 35% and 34% of the Company net
sales for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively. Sales
to another customer represented 10%, 11% and 12% of the Company net sales for
the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively.
CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all
highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to
be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds.
Short term investments consist of a common stock investment in Cypress
Semiconductor, Inc. The Company categorizes its short-term investments as
available for sale and the investments are reported at fair market value. The
fair value of the Company investments was determined based on quoted market
prices at the reporting date for those instruments.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The functional currency of the Company foreign entities is the U.S.
dollar; however, certain of the Company costs and expenses are paid in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company does not currently hedge
against foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and gains and losses arising
from the
31
34
TELCOM SEMICONDUCTOR, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
translation of foreign currency balances and transactions are included in
consolidated results of operations. Gains and losses from such fluctuations have
not been material to the Company consolidated results of operations.
INVENTORIES
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in,
first-out basis, or market.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost, or fair market
value at the time of impairment for impaired assets. Depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method with estimated useful lives of three to five
years for equipment. Leasehold improvements consist of improvements to the
Company facilities and are amortized over the remaining term of the lease or
useful life of the asset, whichever is less.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets based
upon the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from these assets.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentration of credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable.
The Company sells its integrated circuits to customers throughout the world. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial
condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers. The Company
maintains an allowance for uncollectable accounts receivable. The Company
write-offs of accounts receivable were not significant in 1997, 1998 and 1999.
The Company accounts receivable were concentrated with three customers at
December 31, 1998 representing 10%, 11% and 25% of aggregate receivables and
one customer at December 31, 1999 representing 27% of aggregate receivables.
NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE
Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common
stockholders numerator by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding denominator during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all
dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock
options, using the treasury stock method, and convertible preferred stock, using
the if-converted method. In computing Diluted EPS, the average stock price for
the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased
from the exercise of stock options.

$ 011  $ 022  $ 084
Due to the Company net loss from continuing operations in 1997 and 1998,
a calculation of EPS assuming dilution is not required. At December 31, 1997,
there were 2,386,000 options and warrants outstanding to purchase common stock
at a weighted average price of $440 per share. At December 31, 1998, there were
2,975,000 options outstanding to purchase common stock at a weighted average
price of $365 per share. The securities have been excluded from the computation
of dilutive EPS because the inclusion of such warrants and options would have
been anti-dilutive.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value
method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The Company policy is to grant
options with an exercise price equal to the quoted market price of the Company
stock on the date of the grant. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been
recognized in the Company statements of operations. The Company provides
additional pro forma disclosures as required under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
In 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for disclosure and financial
statement display for reporting total comprehensive income and its individual
components. Comprehensive income, as defined, includes all changes in equity
during a period from non-owner sources. The Company comprehensive income
includes net income and unrealized gains and losses on investments and is
displayed in the statement of stockholders' equity.
SEGMENT REPORTING
In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 131 SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information. SFAS 131 supersedes SFAS 14, Financial Reporting for Segments of
a Business Enterprise, replacing the Industry Segment approach with the
Management approach. The management approach designates the internal
organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and
assessing performance as the source of the Company reportable segments. SFAS
131 also requires disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and
major customers. The Company operates in one industry segment comprising the
design, development, manufacture and sale of integrated circuits. The adoption
of SFAS 131 did not affect results of the Company operations or financial
position or the segments reported in 1998.

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 establishes standards for
accounting and reporting on derivative instruments for periods beginning after
June 15, 2000 and early adoption is permitted. SFAS No. 133 requires that all
derivative instruments be recognized in the balance sheet as either assets or
liabilities and measured at fair value. Furthermore, SFAS No. 133 requires
current recognition in earnings of changes in the fair value of derivative
instruments depending on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting
designation. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of the new standard
and has not determined its method or timing of adopting SFAS No. 133 or the
impact on its financial statements.

$7,258, consisting of $6,515 of items relating to the closure of the Company
wafer fabrication facility, and $743 relating to other one-time charges.
In August 1998, the Company announced its plans to shut down its five-inch
wafer fabrication facility in Mountain View, California and use third party
foundries for all of its wafer fabrication. In conjunction with the shut-down of
its wafer fabrication foundry, the Company recorded fab closure charges totaling
$6,515 to write down and write off manufacturing equipment and facilities
improvements; accrue for future idle facility space; accrue severance of
manufacturing and other personnel and other costs.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
A majority of the Company new products that have been developed in the
past years utilize sub-micron wafer technology and are currently fabricated by
outside foundries. All other remaining wafers were fabricated in the Mountain
View facility. In January 1999, the wafer fabrication facility was shut-down and
the fabrication equipment is no longer in use and is being held for sale. By the
end of the first quarter of 1999, all fabrication of wafers was transferred to
third party foundries. The facility shutdown was a result of developments in the
semiconductor industry, primarily the availability of low cost wafer fabrication
capacity and the willingness of outside foundries to offer non-standard
processes. Competitive designs use submicron technology which allows for more
die per wafer than the five inch wafer fabrication used in the old Mountain View
facility. The restructuring charge relating to the write down of the carrying
value of the Company fabrication equipment to its estimated fair value was
$4,458. The cost and accumulated depreciation of the fabrication equipment prior
to the write down was $13,027 and $6,330, respectively. The fair value of the
fabrication equipment was estimated to be $2,239 and was recorded as assets to
be disposed of The fair value of the fabrication equipment was based on third
party estimates of fair value. Separately, during 1998 the Company recorded a
one time charge relating to, amongst other items, the write-off of certain
equipment in Mountain View, California. The fair value of the equipment was
estimated to be $355 and is recorded as assets to be disposed of. During the
first nine months of 1999, net proceeds for the sale of the equipment was $978.
Due to the weakness in the market for used semiconductor equipment, the Company
booked an additional charge in the period ending September 30, 1999 of $997.
This additional charge and the net proceeds from the equipment sales in the
fourth quarter of 1999 adjusts the carrying value of the remaining equipment to
$266 at December 31, 1999. Given the continued oversupply in the used
semiconductor equipment market, the Company is unable to predict the time needed
to dispose of the assets classified as assets to be disposed of.
The restructuring charge for 1998 also included charges for idle facilities
of $1,406, severance payments totaling $519 for employees terminated upon
closing of the facility and environmental and related clean up costs of $132.
Additional restructuring charges were included in the first quarter of 1999 for
employee severance costs of $243 and environmental and related clean up costs of
$26. During the period ending September 30, 1999, the Company renegotiated its
lease for the Mt. View facility by terminating its lease with Teledyne
Industries in exchange for a sublease of the facility from Clontech
Laboratories, Inc. The new sublease provides for a reduction in the square
footage currently occupied by the company by June 1, 2000 which will eliminate
the idle facility. As a result, the Company reversed idle facility costs of
$1,047, previously accrued in 1998, leaving a remaining balance of $161 that
will be amortized through May 2000. Additionally, the Company recorded
additional restructuring charges in the third quarter 1999 of $50 for additional
costs associated with the facility clean up and removal of the fabrication
equipment.

company and, as part of the purchase agreement between IC WORKS and Cypress
Semiconductor, the Company preferred shares, with a book value of $1,500, were
exchanged for common shares of Cypress Semiconductor with a fair market value of
$6,506. As part of the agreement, ten percent of the common shares received by

by Cypress Semiconductor or one year from the date of purchase. During the
quarter ended June 30, 1999, the company sold all of the shares it held, except
the shares held in escrow, for $6,730 and recognized an additional gain on the
sale of $813 representing the increase in the fair value between the date the
shares were received and the date the shares were sold. The value of the shares
held in escrow at December 31, 1999 is $2,286 and is presented as short term
investments. These shares are accounted for as an available for sale security in
accordance with FAS 115.
NOTE 6 -- INVESTMENT IN SAI   On October 7, 1999, the Company entered into a Common Stock Agreement and a
Stockholder Purchase Agreement with Silicon Aquarius Incorporated SAI. In
accordance with the Common Stock Agreement the Company purchased 13 million
shares of common stock of SAI, representing an 1867% ownership interest in SAI,
for $30 million. In addition, the Common Stock Agreement provides the Company
with an option to purchase an additional 17 million shares for $40 million on
or before October 7, 2000. The Stockholder Purchase Agreement gives the Company
an option to purchase the remaining outstanding shares from the major
stockholders of SAI on or before November 30, 2001 at the then fair market value
of SAI stock. Notwithstanding this determination, the fair market value shall
not be less than $334 or greater than $900 per share. The Company accounts for
this investment on the equity method with a 90-day lag in recording the
Company share of results for the entity.
NOTE 7 -- INCOME TAXES   The Company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability approach
that requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the
Company financial statements or income tax returns. Provisions are made for
estimated United States and foreign income taxes, less available tax credits and
deductions, which may be incurred on the remittance of certain of the Company
foreign subsidiaries' undistributed earnings. Deferred taxes have not been
provided for the cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which
are considered by management to be permanently reinvested.

Due to the uncertainty of the realization of a portion of deferred tax

extent there is no current realization at December 31, 1998 and 1999. Upon
recognition of the Company deferred tax assets, approximately $900 will be
credited directly to equity as a result of previous exercises of non qualified
stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options.
The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying
the U.S. statutory federal rate to income before taxes as a result of the

NOTE 8 -- PREFERRED STOCK   The Company has authorized 5,000,000 shares of undesignated Preferred
Stock. The Board of Directors has the authority to issue the undesignated
Preferred Stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued
shares of undesignated Preferred Stock and to fix the number of shares
constituting any series in the designations of such series, without any further
vote or action by the stockholders. The Board of Directors, without stockholder
approval, can issue Preferred Stock with voting and conversion rights which
could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of Common Stock. In
November 1998, the Company designated 30,000 shares of Preferred Stock as Series
A of Participating Preferred Stock in connection with the adoption of a
shareholders rights program. The issuance of Preferred Stock may have the effect
of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company.
NOTE 9 -- COMMON STOCK TREASURY STOCK
In July 1998, the Company Board of Directors approved a plan to
repurchase an aggregate of up to 2 million shares of common stock. In October
1998, the Company Board of Directors approved a plan to repurchase an
additional 2 million shares of common stock, for a total repurchase of up to 4
million shares. At December 31, 1999, a total of 31 million shares have been
repurchased by the Company at an aggregate cost of $12,697 at an average price
of $407 per share.
STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS PLAN
In November 1998, the Company implemented a plan to protect shareholders'
rights in the event of a proposed takeover of the Company. Under the plan, each
share of the Company outstanding common stock carries one right to purchase
one-thousandth of a share of the Company Series A Participating Preferred
Stock the Right at an exercise price of $3000 per share. The Right enables
the holder to purchase common stock of the Company or of the acquiring company
ten days after a person or group publicly announces it has acquired or has
tendered an offer for 15% or more of the Company outstanding common stock. The
Rights are redeemable by the Company at $0001 per Right at any time on or
before the tenth day following acquisition by a person or group of 15% or more
of the Company common stock. If prior to redemption of the Rights, a person or
group acquires 15% or more of the Company common stock, each Right not owned
by a holder of 15% or more of the common stock or an affiliate of such holder
will entitle the holder to purchase, at the Right then current exercise price,
that number of shares of common stock of the Company having a market value at
the time of twice the Right exercise price. The Rights expire in November
2008.
EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN
In February 1994, the Company adopted its 1994 Stock Option Plan the
Option Plan which provides for the granting of incentive stock options and
nonstatutory stock options to officers, employees and consultants of the
Company. Incentive stock options are granted at an amount not less than 100% of
the fair market value of the stock on the grant date. During 1997, the Board of
Directors and shareholders approved an increase to the number of shares that may
be issued under the plan from 2,800,000 shares to 3,300,000 shares. During 1998,
the Board of Directors and shareholders approved an increase to the number of
shares that may be issued under the plan from 3,300,000 shares to 4,300,000
shares. During 1999, the Board of Directors and shareholders approved an
increase to the number of shares that may be issued under the plan from
4,300,000 shares to 5,300,000 shares. In January 1996, the Board of Directors
approved an option exchange program whereby certain employees were able to
exchange their existing options to purchase an aggregate of
38

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
418,500 shares of Common Stock at exercise prices ranging from $600 to $875
for new options to purchase an aggregate of 418,500 shares at $487 per share.
In June 1998, the Board of Directors approved an option exchange program whereby
certain employees were able to exchange their existing options to purchase an
aggregate of 934,243 shares of Common Stock at exercise prices ranging from
$788 to $1594 for new options to purchase an aggregate of 934,243 shares at
$431 per share. Generally all employees exchanged their existing options for
new options. Options generally vest over a four year period. Option terms may
not exceed ten years from the date of grant and unexercised options expire upon
termination of employment. The weighted average fair value of options granted
during 1997, 1998, 1999 was $378, $250 and $526, respectively.
DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION PLAN
During 1996, the Company adopted and approved the Company 1996 Director
Stock Option Plan the Director Plan with 100,000 shares of Common Stock
reserved for issuance thereunder. Under the Director Plan, each non-employee
director who joins the Board will automatically be granted a non-statutory
option to purchase 12,000 shares of Common Stock on the date upon which such
person first becomes a director. In addition, each non-employee director will
automatically receive a non-statutory option to purchase 3,000 shares of Common
Stock upon such director annual re-election to the Board, provided the
director has been a member of the Board for at least six months upon the date of
reelection. The exercise price of each option granted under the Director Plan
must be equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of the
grant. The 12,000 share grant vests at the rate of twenty-five percent 25% of
the option shares upon the first anniversary of the date of grant and as to
twenty-five 25% of the shares each year thereafter and the 3,000 share grant
vests monthly over a twelve 12 month period. Options granted under the
Director Plan have a term of ten years unless terminated sooner, whether upon
termination of the optionee status as a director or otherwise pursuant to the
Director Plan. The weighted average fair values of the options granted during
1997, 1998 and 1999 was $322, $714 and $310 per share, respectively. The
Board believes that the Director Plan is necessary to attract and retain highly
qualified individuals to serve as non-employee members of the Board of
Directors.

The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions used for grants during 1997,
1998 and 1999: annual dividend yield of 00% for all periods; risk-free annual
interest rates of 587% to 667% for options granted during the year ended
December 31, 1997, 425% to 562% for options granted during the year ended
December 31, 1998 and 472% to 602% for options granted in the year ended
December 31, 1999; a weighted average expected option term of five years for all
periods; and an expected volatility factor of 60% for 1997, 72% for 1998 and 81%
for 1999.
EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
In May 1995, the Company adopted its 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Purchase Plan. Under the Purchase Plan, an eligible employee may purchase
shares of Common Stock from the Company through payroll deductions of up to 10%
of their base compensation plus commissions, at a price per share equal to 85%
of the fair market value as of the first day or the last day, whichever is
lower, of each six-month offering period under the Purchase Plan. An employee
can purchase at the lowest offering period purchase price going back for up to
two years of participation. The offering periods commence on July 1 and January
1 of each year. The Company has reserved 200,000 shares of Common Stock for
issuance under the Purchase Plan. During 1996, the Purchase Plan was amended to
increase the shares reserved for issuance by 200,000 shares, bringing the total
number of shares issuable under the Purchase Plan to 400,000. During 1998, the
Purchase Plan was amended to increase the shares reserved for issuance by
500,000 shares, bringing the total number of shares issuable under the Purchase
Plan to 900,000. At December 31, 1999, 480,720 shares of Common Stock had been
issued under the Purchase Plan, and 419,280 shares remained available for future
issuance under the Purchase Plan.
The fair value of each stock award is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions used for grants during
1997, 1998 and 1999: annual dividend yield of 00% for all periods; risk-free
annual interest rates of 549% to 566% for stock awards granted during the year

NOTE 12 -- LOSS ON FOUNDRY INVESTMENT   In November 1995, the Company entered into certain agreements with IC
WORKS, Inc. a privately-held company located in San Jose, California. Pursuant
to these agreements, in 1996 the Company purchased $30 million of preferred
stock of IC WORKS and provided $104 million in capital equipment. In return for
this investment, TelCom received a guarantee of submicron wafer capacity at
specified prices for a period of five years, projected to start in late 1997.
The shortage of wafer capacity projected in late 1995 has diminished and since
late 1995, substantial foundry capacity has been available worldwide while
overall demand has not increased proportionately. Consequently, wafer pricing
has decreased dramatically, which has changed the economic viability of the
foundry business in which the Company invested. As a result, in the first
quarter of 1997, the Company recorded an impairment loss on its foundry
investment of $80 million, consisting of a $30 million write down of the
preferred stock and a $50 million impairment write down of the equipment. In
the fourth quarter of 1997, pursuant to an agreement with IC WORKS, the Company
sold the $104 million dollars of equipment at IC WORKS for $52 million and
invested an additional $15 million in preferred stock of IC WORKS. This
agreement terminates the Company operating agreement with IC WORKS. As a
result of these events and transactions, the Company recorded a loss of $83
million on its foundry investment in 1997 of which $80 million was recorded in
the first quarter of 1997, which consists of a $30 million write down of the
preferred stock, a loss on the sale of the equipment of $52 million, and $1
million of costs associated with prepayment penalties on financing of the
equipment and legal fees. Two of the Company directors who served during 1997
also served as directors of IC WORKS.
NOTE 13 -- SUBSEQUENT EVENT   On February 1, 2000, the Company invested $16 million for approximately a
4% equity interest in Central Semiconductor Holdings Company Limited which owns
100% of Central Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited CSMC. CSMC is one
of the foundries used by the Company to manufacture the Company products.
