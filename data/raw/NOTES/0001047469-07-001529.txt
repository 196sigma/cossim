Management Report on Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control    
The
management of CovanceInc. Covance has prepared, and is responsible for, Covance consolidated financial statements and related footnotes. These consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Covance
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. The purpose of this system of internal accounting controls over financial reporting is to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that transactions are executed
in accordance with management authorization and are properly recorded, and that accounting records may be relied upon for the preparation of accurate and complete consolidated financial statements.
The design, monitoring and revision of internal accounting control systems involve, among other things, management judgment with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of specific
control measures. Covance also maintains an internal audit function that evaluates and reports on the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls, policies and procedures. 
Covance
management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006 was effective and adequate to accomplish the objectives described above.
Management assessment was based upon the criteria in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Covance
consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of control over financial reporting have been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, as stated
in their reports which are included elsewhere herein.  /s/ Joseph L. Herring Joseph L. Herring

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
CovanceInc. 
We
have audited management assessment, included in Management Report on Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control, that CovanceInc. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. CovanceInc. management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In
our opinion, management assessment that CovanceInc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, CovanceInc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria. 
We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of CovanceInc. and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2006 and our report dated February22, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  MetroPark,

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    
The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
CovanceInc. We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CovanceInc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of CovanceInc. and subsidiaries at
December31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2006, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
As
discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006 the Company adopted SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payments applying the modified prospective
method at the beginning of fiscal year 2006. Also, as discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted SFAS No158, Employers' Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106 and 132R at the end of fiscal year 2006. We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of CovanceInc. internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission, and our report dated February22, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  MetroPark,

1.Organization  CovanceInc. and its subsidiaries Covance or the Company is a leading drug development services company providing a wide range
of early-stage and
late-stage product development services on a worldwide basis primarily to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries. Covance also provides services such as laboratory
testing to the chemical, agrochemical and food industries. Covance operations constitute two segments for financial reporting purposes. The first segment, early development services, includes
preclinical and clinical pharmacology service offerings. The second segment, late-stage development services, includes central laboratory, clinical development, cardiac safety services,
periapproval and market access services. Operations are principally focused in the United States and Europe. 
2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Principles of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities controlled by Covance. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions are
eliminated. The equity method of accounting is used for investments in affiliates in which Covance owns between 20 and 50percent and does not have the ability to exercise control. See
Note5.  Use of Estimates  These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP,
which requires management
to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  Foreign Currencies  For subsidiaries outside of the United States that operate in a local currency environment, income and expense items are translated to
United States dollars at
the monthly average rates of exchange prevailing during the year, assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange
rates. Translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are included in the determination of comprehensive income in the
Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity. Transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of net income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at date of purchase and
consist principally of
amounts invested in money market funds.  Financial Instruments  The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their carrying amounts
as reported at
December31, 2006 and 2005.

2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
Accounts
receivable and unbilled services represent amounts due from Covance customers who are concentrated primarily in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Covance
endeavors to monitor the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the ordinary course of business. Although Covance customers are concentrated primarily within these two
industries, management considers the likelihood of material credit risk as remote. In addition, in some cases Covance requires advance payment for a portion of the contract price from its customers
upon the signing of a contract for services. These amounts are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are performed. Historically, bad debts have been immaterial.  Inventory  Inventories, which consist principally of finished goods and supplies, are valued at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or
market.  Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets  In connection with the management of multi-site clinical trials, Covance pays on behalf of its customers fees to investigators, volunteers
and other
out-of-pocket costs such
as travel, printing, meetings, couriers, etc., for which we are reimbursed at cost, without mark-up or profit. Amounts receivable from customers in connection with billed and unbilled
investigator fees, volunteer payments and other out-of-pocket pass-through costs are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $377million and $316million at December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. See Note2 Reimbursable
Out-of-Pocket Expenses.  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method at rates adequate to
allocate the
cost of the applicable assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from ten to forty years for buildings and improvements, three to ten years for equipment, furniture and fixtures
and three to five years for computer hardware and software. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of
the improvement or the associated remaining lease term. The cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use is accounted for in accordance with the Accounting Standards Executive
Committee Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. Repairs and
maintenance are expensed as incurred.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Impairment  Goodwill represents costs in excess of the fair value of net tangible and identifiable net intangible assets acquired in business
combinations. In accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Covance performs an annual test for
impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter. This test is performed by comparing, at the reporting unit level, the carrying value of the reporting
unit to its fair value. Covance assesses fair value based upon its estimate of the present value of the future cash flows that it expects to be generated by the reporting unit. The annual test for
impairment performed for 2006, 2005 and 2004 did not identify any instances of impairment.

2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
Intangible
assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range in term from one to ten years. The Company
periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets. See Note4.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Covance assesses impairment of long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the
Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Assessments of the recoverability of long-lived assets are conducted when events or changes in circumstances occur that
indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based upon the ability to recover the asset from the expected future undiscounted cash
flows of related operations. No events have been identified that caused an evaluation of the recoverability of the long-lived assets for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and
2004.  Revenue Recognition  Covance recognizes revenue either as services are performed or products are delivered, depending upon the nature of the work contracted.
Historically, a majority
of Covance net revenues have been earned under contracts which range in duration from a few months to two years, but can extend in duration up to five years or longer. Service contracts generally
take the form of fee-for-service or fixed-price arrangements. In the case of fee-for-service contracts, revenue is recognized as services are performed,
based upon, for example, hours worked or samples tested. For long-term fixed-price service contracts, revenue is recognized as services are performed, with performance generally assessed
using output measures, such as units-of-work performed to date as compared to the total units-of-work contracted. Changes in the scope of work generally
result in a renegotiation of contract pricing terms. Renegotiated amounts are not included in net revenues until earned and realization is assured. Estimates of costs to complete are made to provide,
where appropriate, for losses expected on contracts. Costs are not deferred in anticipation of contracts being awarded, but instead are expensed as incurred. In some cases, a portion of the contract
fee is paid at the time the trial is initiated. These advances are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are performed or products are delivered, as discussed above. Additional payments may
be made based upon the achievement of performance-based milestones over the contract duration. Most contracts are terminable by the client either immediately or upon notice. These contracts typically
require payment to Covance of expenses to wind down the study, fees earned to date and, in some cases, a termination fee or a payment to Covance of some portion of the fees or profits that could have
been earned by Covance under the contract if it had not been terminated early. Termination fees are included in net revenues when realization is assured. In connection with the management of
multi-site clinical trials, Covance pays on behalf of its customers fees to investigators, volunteers and other out-of-pocket costs such as for travel, printing,
meetings, couriers, etc., for which it is reimbursed at cost, without mark-up or profit. Investigator fees are not reflected in total revenues or expenses where Covance acts in the
capacity of an agent on behalf of the pharmaceutical company sponsor, passing through these costs without risk or reward to Covance. All other out-of-pocket costs are included
in total revenues and expenses. 
Unbilled
services are recorded for revenue recognized to date and relate to amounts that are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms. In general, amounts
become billable upon the achievement of milestones or in accordance with predetermined payment schedules. Unbilled services are billable to customers within one year from the respective balance sheet
date. Unearned revenue is recorded for cash received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized at the balance sheet date.

2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued  Costs and Expenses  Cost of revenue includes direct labor and related benefit charges, other direct costs, shipping and handling fees, and an allocation of
facility charges and
information technology costs and excludes depreciation and amortization. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of administrative payroll and related benefit charges,
advertising and promotional expenses, administrative travel and an allocation of facility charges and information technology costs and excludes depreciation and amortization. Cost of advertising is
expensed as incurred.  Taxes  Covance uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the
expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in enacted tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is effective. See Note7. 
Covance
maintains a tax reserve for uncertain tax positions which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The balance of this
tax reserve at December31, 2006 is $84million and relates to exposures for tax matters such as transfer pricing, nexus, deemed dividends, VAT and the allocation of overhead costs
across various Federal, state and foreign income tax jurisdictions. By way of background, an accrual is established at the time an exposure is identified when it is both probable that a liability has
been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the accrual for each item for which an exposure exists is adjusted when either amatters are settled
at amounts which are different than the amount included in the reserve or bwhen facts indicate a significant change in either the probability or estimated amount of the potential exposure.
While Covance believes that it has identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and that the reserve it has established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances, it is
possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures will be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved. It is also possible that changes in estimates in the future could cause
Covance to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of its tax reserve. Significant activity relating to the reserve for uncertain tax positions which occurred during 2006 included a
$25million reduction in the reserve during the third quarter of 2006 as a result of a
favorable settlement with a foreign tax authority relating to research and development tax credits totaling $18million, as well as exposures as to which it is no longer probable that a
liability exists relating primarily to transfer pricing matters aggregating $07million. Partially offsetting this reduction was an increase in the reserve balance during the fourth quarter of
2006 totaling $22million relating to various state and foreign tax exposures arising in the fourth quarter of 2006 as well as the accrual of additional interest on matters still outstanding.
See Recently Issued Accounting Standards. Covance
historical policy has been to leave its unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the United States. Except for the one-time opportunity provided
under the American Jobs Creation Act, pursuant to which Covance repatriated $103million in accumulated foreign earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005, Covance intends to continue to leave its
unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the United States. As a result, taxes have not been provided on any accumulated foreign unremitted earnings as of December31, 2006.

2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued  Comprehensive Income  Covance total comprehensive income represents net income plus the change in the cumulative translation adjustment equity account, and
for 2006, also includes
the adjustment resulting from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106 and 132R, SFAS158 to record the under funded status of the Company defined benefit
postretirement plans on its balance sheet at December31, 2006.  Stock Based Compensation  The Company sponsors several stock-based compensation plans pursuant to which non-qualified stock options and restricted stock awards are
granted to
eligible employees. These plans are described more fully in Note10. 
Through
the year ended December31, 2005, the Company followed the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
SFAS123, and, accordingly, accounted for awards under these plans pursuant to the recognition and
measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, APB 25 and related
Interpretations, as permitted by SFAS123. Under APB 25, compensation expense was recognized in the financial statements relating to awards of stock. However, no compensation expense was
recorded in the financial statements for stock option grants, as all options
have been granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Additionally, no compensation expense was recorded in the financial statements
for shares purchased by employees under the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan as that plan was considered to be non-compensatory under APB 25. Effective
January1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Share-Based Payments, SFAS123R using the modified
prospective transition method. SFAS123R revises SFAS123, supersedes APB 25
and amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No95, Statement of Cash Flows. Under the modified prospective transition method,
compensation expense is recognized in the financial statements on a prospective basis for aall share-based payments granted prior to, but not vested as of January1, 2006, based upon
the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS123, and bshare-based payments granted on or subsequent to January1, 2006,
based upon the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS123R. The grant-date fair value of awards expected to vest is expensed on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period of the related awards. Under the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods are not restated.  Earnings Per Share EPS  Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during
the period. The
computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if
the dilutive potential common shares had been issued; computed under the treasury stock method in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No128, Earnings Per
Share.

2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued In
computing diluted EPS for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the denominator was increased by 1,196,490 shares, 1,170,734 shares and 2,169,804 shares,
respectively, representing the dilutive effect of stock options outstanding at December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, with exercise prices less than the average market price of Covance common
stock during each respective period. Excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for the year ended December31, 2006 were options to purchase 12,263 shares of common stock at prices ranging
from $6126 to $6686 per share because the exercise prices of such options were greater than the average market price of Covance common stock during 2006. Excluded from the computation of diluted
EPS for the year ended December31, 2005 were options to purchase 54,617 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $4727 to $5271 per share because the exercise prices of such options
were greater than the average market price of Covance common stock during 2005. Excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for the year ended December31, 2004 were options to purchase
331,072 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $3584 to $4145 per share because the exercise prices of such options were greater than the average market price of Covance common stock during
2004.  Reimbursable Out-of-Pocket Expenses  As discussed in Note2 Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets, Covance pays on behalf of its customers fees to investigators,
volunteers and other
out-of-pocket costs for which we are reimbursed at cost, without mark-up or profit. In connection with the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board
Emerging Issues Task Force Rule No01-14 EITF 01-14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for
Out-of-Pocket Expenses Incurred, amounts paid to volunteers and other out-of-pocket costs are reflected in operating expenses,
while the reimbursements received are reflected in revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Covance will continue to exclude from revenue and expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income
fees paid to investigators and the associated reimbursement since Covance acts as an agent on behalf of the pharmaceutical company sponsors with regard to investigator payments.  Supplemental Cash Flow Information  Cash paid for interest for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled $02million, $02million and
$09million,
respectively. Cash paid for income taxes for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled $478million, $252million and $211million, respectively. The
change in income taxes payable in the consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December31, 2006 reflects as an operating cash outflow the excess tax benefit received from the
exercise of non-qualified stock options as measured under SFAS123R of $74million a corresponding cash inflow of $74million has been reflected in financing cash
flows. The change in income taxes payable in the Consolidated Statement of Cash flows for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004 reflects the full tax benefit received from the exercise of
non-qualified stock options of $117million and $162million, respectively, as measured and accounted for under SFAS123 and APB 25. Pursuant to those standards,
both the reduction in income taxes payable and the increase in equity resulting from the full tax benefit received are reflected in operating cash flows.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In September2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106 and 132R,

2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
December31,
2006, Covance has adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS158, which require an employer to recognize the over funded or under funded status of its defined
benefit postretirement plansmeasured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligationas an asset or liability, respectively, in
its balance sheet and to recognize changes in the funded status of the plan in the year in which such changes occur through other comprehensive income. See Note9 for a discussion of the impact
of the adoption of SFAS158. SFAS158 also requires, effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2008, that the measurement of the over funded or under funded status of a
plan be made as of the employer fiscal year end and not as of an earlier measurement date. Covance will be required to conform the measurement dates of its plans to
December31st for its fiscal year ending December31, 2008. Covance does not expect this change in measurement dates to have a material impact on its consolidated results
of operations or financial position. 
In
September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements, SFAS157. SFAS157, which
applies whenever other standards require or permit fair value measurement, defines fair value and provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS157 also
requires expanded disclosures about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used in those measurements and the effect of fair value measurements on
earnings. Covance will be required to adopt SFAS157, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, no later than the quarter beginning January1, 2008.
Covance is currently in the process of evaluating SFAS157, and has not yet determined the impact, if any, SFAS157 will have on its consolidated results of operations or financial
position. 
In
June2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan Interpretation of FASB Statement
No109 FIN 48. This authoritative interpretation clarifies and standardizes the manner by which companies will be required to account for uncertain tax positions.
Adoption of FIN 48 is required for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006. Covance is required to adopt FIN 48 for its first quarter ending March31, 2007 and is currently
finalizing its estimate of the impact of adopting FIN 48. Covance currently estimates that the reserve for uncertain tax positions, which totals $84million at December31, 2006 under
SFAS109 and SFAS 5, will be between $90million and $120million as calculated under the measurement provisions of FIN 48. The additional reserve for uncertain tax positions,
currently estimated in the range of $06million to $36million, will be recorded in retained earnings in the first quarter of 2007 as a cumulative effect change of adopting a new
accounting pronouncement. 
In
June2006, the Emerging Issues Taskforce reached a consensus on EITF Issue No06-3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted
to Government Authorities Should be Presented in the Income Statement That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation, EITF 06-3 which addresses the
income statement disclosure on taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer, such as sales taxes, use taxes,
value-added taxes and some types of excise taxes. For any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis, EITF 06-3, which is effective for interim periods beginning after
December15, 2006, requires disclosure of the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period in which an income statement is presented. Covance currently
accounts for taxes on a net basis, therefore, EITF 06-3 is not expected to have any impact on the Company consolidated results of operations or financial position.

In March2004, Covance acquired a 47% minority equity position in Noveprim Limited, a supplier of research products, for a total cost
of
$207million. The excess of the purchase price over the underlying equity in Noveprim net assets was approximately $138million at the acquisition date. This investment is reflected
in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005, Covance recognized income of $16million and $13million, respectively,
representing its share of Noveprim earnings, less the elimination of profit on inventory purchased from Noveprim Limited and still on hand at Covance at December31, 2006 and 2005. The
carrying value of Covance investment in Noveprim as of December31, 2006 and 2005 was $230million and $217million, respectively. 
Covance
has a minority equity position approximately 21% at December31, 2006 in Bio-Imaging Technologies,Inc. BITI. BITI uses proprietary medical
imaging technologies to process and analyze medical images, and also provides other services, including the data-basing and regulatory submission of medical images, quantitative data and
text. During the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005, Covance recognized income of $002million and a loss of $05million, respectively, representing its pro rata share of
BITI earnings. The carrying value of Covance investment in BITI at both December31, 2006 and 2005 was $05million, while the fair market value was $190million and
$76million, respectively.

6.Acquisitions 
In May2006, Covance acquired the stock of Radiant ResearchInc. Radiant in a merger transaction for cash payments
aggregating approximately
$666million including direct acquisition costs of $05million. The
Radiant acquisition included eight early development clinical sites performing Phase I/IIa clinical trial services. Results of operations for Radiant, which are now part of Covance Early Development
segment service offering, and the fair value of Radiant assets and liabilities acquired, are included in Covance consolidated financial statements beginning in June2006. 
In
May2006, Covance also acquired certain assets and liabilities of Signet Laboratories,Inc. Signet for cash payments totaling $91million including direct
acquisition costs of $02million. Signet specializes in the development of monoclonal antibodies and diagnostic assays for cancer, infectious diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. Results
of operations for Signet, which are now part of Covance Early Development segment service offering, and the fair value of Signet assets and liabilities acquired, are included in Covance
consolidated financial statements beginning in June2006. 
The
table below summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocations for the Radiant and Signet acquisitions: Radiant

purchase price allocations are based upon preliminary estimates for tax matters, using available information and making assumptions management believes are reasonable. Accordingly,
these purchase price allocations are subject to finalization within one year of each acquisition. The goodwill resulting from the Signet acquisition is deductible for tax purposes, while the goodwill
resulting from the merger with Radiant is not deductible for tax purposes. 
In
2005, Covance acquired two businesses, the largest of which was the acquisition of GFI Clinical Services an 80 bed clinical pharmacology business, for cash payments totaling
$71million. The goodwill resulting from these acquisitions aggregated $44million.

7.Taxes on Income Continued  As of December31, 2006, the non-current deferred tax asset includes $107million related to liabilities not currently
deductible,
recorded in connection with the adoption of SFAS158, and $46million of expenses not currently deductible, related to stock-based compensation under SFAS123R. 
In
connection with the acquisition of Radiant ResearchInc., Covance recorded a net deferred tax asset of $66million primarily relating to acquired net operating loss
carryforwards. The utilization of the net loss carryforwards totaling $167million as of December31, 2006 is subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code
382 and will expire at various dates through 2026. It is expected that the
entire net operating loss carryforwards will be realized and, accordingly, no valuation allowance has been provided at December31, 2006. 
At
December31, 2006, deferred tax assets of $82million have been recorded on $273million of net operating tax loss carryforwards arising in the United Kingdom
from the current recognition of deductions for qualified research and development expenditures and accelerated depreciation. It is expected that the entire net operating loss carryforwards, which do
not expire, will be realized and, accordingly, no valuation allowance has been provided. On
October22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act was signed into law. Among other things, the Act provided a temporary incentive for multi-national
companies to repatriate previously unremitted foreign earnings by allowing companies a special one-time tax deduction equal to 85% of qualified foreign earnings that were repatriated.
During the fourth quarter of 2005, Covance repatriated $103million in foreign earnings under the Act, which resulted in the recording of an income tax charge of $44million or
$007/diluted share. 
Covance
currently provides income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the extent those earnings are taxable or are expected to be remitted. Covance historical policy has
been to leave its unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the United States. Except for the amounts repatriated in the fourth quarter of 2005 under the Act, Covance intends to
continue to leave its unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the United States. It is not practical to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable if such
accumulated earnings were remitted. Additionally, if such accumulated earnings were remitted, certain countries impose withholding taxes that, subject to certain limitations, are available for use as
a tax credit against any Federal income tax liability arising from such remittance. As a result, taxes have not been provided on the remaining accumulated foreign unremitted earnings totaling
approximately $195million at December31, 2006. 
8.Credit Facility  Covance has a $750million revolving credit facility the Credit Facility, which expires in June2009. At both
December31, 2006 and
2005, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. At December31, 2006 and 2005, there were $08million and $15million, respectively, of outstanding letters
of credit under the Credit Facility. 
At
December31, 2006, Covance was in compliance with the terms of the Credit Facility, including all financial covenants. Commitment fees paid during 2006, 2005 and 2004, which
under the Credit Facility are
15 basis points on the undrawn balance, approximated $01million, $01million, and $04million, respectively. The Credit Facility is collateralized by guarantees of certain of
Covance domestic subsidiaries and a pledge of 65percent of the capital stock of certain of Covance foreign subsidiaries.

9.Employee Benefit Plans 
Covance sponsors various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. Effective December31, 2006, Covance adopted Statement of
Financial
Accounting Standards No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106 and
132R, SFAS158. SFAS158 requires an employer to recognize the over funded or under funded status of its defined benefit postretirement
plansmeasured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligationas an asset or liability, respectively, in its balance sheet and to
recognize changes in the funded status of the plan through other comprehensive income in the year such changes occur. The impact of adopting SFAS158 on our consolidated balance sheet at
December31, 2006 was an increase in non-current liabilities of $213million, reflecting the under funded status of the plans, a reduction in other assets of
$128million, from the elimination of the prepaid pension asset which existed under SFAS 87, the recording of a long-term deferred tax asset of $107million and a reduction
in the other comprehensive income equity account of $234million.  Defined Benefit Pension Plans  Covance sponsors two defined benefit pension plans for the benefit of its employees at two United Kingdom subsidiaries and one defined
benefit pension plan for
the benefit of its employees at a German subsidiary, all of which are legacy plans of previously acquired companies. Benefit amounts for all three plans are based upon years of service and
compensation. The German plan is unfunded and has a measurement date of September30, while the UK pension plans are funded and have a measurement date of December31. Covance funding
policy has been to contribute annually a fixed percentage of the eligible employee salary at least equal to the local statutory funding requirements. The components of net periodic pension cost for
these plans for 2006, 2005 and 2004 are as follows: United Kingdom Plans

weighted average expected long term rate of return on the assets of the UK pension plans is based on the target asset allocation and the average rate of growth expected for the
asset classes invested. The weighted average rate of expected growth is derived from a combination of historic returns, current market indicators, the expected risk premium for each asset class over
the risk- free rate and the opinion of professional advisors.

The
investment policies for the UK pension plans are set by the plan trustees, based upon the guidance of professional advisors and after consultation with the Company, taking into
consideration the plans' liabilities and future funding levels. The trustees have set the long-term investment policy largely in accordance with the asset allocation of a broadly
diversified investment portfolio. Assets are invested within the target ranges as follows:  Equity securities

are made in pooled investment funds. Pooled investment fund managers are regulated by the Financial Services Authority in the UK and operate under terms which contain
restrictions on the way in which the portfolios are managed and require the managers to ensure that suitable internal operating procedures are in place. The trustees have set performance objectives
for each fund manager and routinely monitor and assess the managers' performance against such objectives. Covance
expects to contribute $3,430 to its UK plans in 2007. No contributions are expected to be made to the German plan, since that plan is unfunded.

December2003, the President of the United States signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Prescription Drug Act. The
Prescription Drug Act introduces a prescription drug benefit beginning in 2006 under Medicare Medicare PartD as well as a Federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans
that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare PartD. Final regulations on determining actuarial equivalency were issued on January21, 2005. Covance
completed its review of the final regulations during the first quarter of 2005 and determined that the benefits provided under its postretirement benefit plan are actuarially equivalent to Medicare
PartD. The effect of the Prescription Drug Act was first incorporated into the measurement of plan obligations at November30, 2005, resulting in a $10million reduction of the
accumulated benefit obligation. The Federal subsidy resulted in a $01million reduction to net periodic benefit costs for 2006.

Preferred Stock. The
Covance Board of Directors has the authority to issue such shares from time to time, without stockholder approval, and to determine the designations, preferences, rights, including voting rights, and
restrictions of such shares, subject to the Delaware General Corporate Laws. Pursuant to this authority, the Covance Board of Directors has designated 10million shares of the Covance Series
Preferred Stock as Covance SeriesA Preferred Stock. No other class of Covance Series Preferred Stock has been designated by the Board. As of December31, 2006, no Covance Series
Preferred Stock has been issued or is outstanding.  DividendsCommon Stock  Covance Board of Directors may declare dividends on the shares of Covance common stock out of legally available funds subject to any
preferential rights of
any outstanding Covance Series Preferred Stock. However, Covance has no present intention to declare dividends, but instead intends to retain earnings to provide funds for the operation and expansion
of its business.  Treasury Stock  In February2003, the Covance Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 30million shares under Covance stock
repurchase program. In
June2004, the Covance Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 30million shares under Covance stock repurchase program. For the years ended December31,
2006, 2005, and 2004, Covance repurchased 04million shares, 12million shares, and 35million shares, respectively, under Covance stock repurchase program. At
December31, 2006 there were 03million shares remaining for purchase under the 2004 authorization. Covance also reacquires shares of its common stock in connection with certain

10.Stockholders' Equity Continued  Stock Compensation Plans  In June2002, Covance Board of Directors adopted the 2002 Employee Stock Option Plan the 2002 ESOP. The 2002 ESOP will expire
on June24,
2012. The 2002 ESOP authorizes the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors the Compensation Committee, or such committee as is appointed by the Covance Board of
Directors, to administer the 2002 ESOP, to grant awards to employees of Covance or entities in which Covance has a controlling or significant interest, except that officers as defined in
Rule16a-1f of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and members of the Board of Directors are not eligible to receive awards. The 2002 ESOP authorizes the Compensation Committee
to grant the following awards to eligible employees: options to purchase common stock and stock appreciation rights. The exercise period for stock options granted under the 2002 ESOP is determined by
the Compensation Committee at the time of grant, and is generally ten years from the date of grant. The vesting period for stock options granted under the 2002 ESOP is determined by the Compensation
Committee at the time of grant and is generally two years from the date of grant. No stock appreciation rights have ever been granted under the 2002 ESOP. The number of shares of Covance common stock
initially available for grant under the 2002 ESOP totaled 59million. The Company issues authorized but previously unissued shares when options are exercised. At December31, 2006,
there were approximately 31million shares remaining available for grants or awards under the 2002 ESOP. 
In
May2002, Covance shareholders approved the 2002 Employee Equity Participation Plan the 2002 EEPP in replacement of the 2000 Employee Equity Participation Plan the
2000 EEPP. The 2002 EEPP became effective on May7, 2002 and will expire on May6, 2012. The 2002 EEPP authorizes the Compensation Committee, or such committee as is appointed by the
Covance Board of Directors, to administer the 2002 EEPP, to grant awards to employees and consultants of Covance or entities in which
Covance has a controlling or significant interest. The 2002 EEPP authorizes the Compensation Committee to grant the following awards to eligible employees: options to purchase common stock; stock
appreciation rights; and other stock awards either singly or in combination. The exercise period for stock options granted under the 2002 EEPP is determined by the Compensation Committee at the time
of grant, and is generally ten years from the date of grant. The vesting period for stock options and stock awards granted under the 2002 EEPP is determined by the Compensation Committee at the time
of grant. Generally, options vest over a three year period for senior executives and over a two year period for all other optionees. Stock awards generally vest over a three year period for all
employees. The number of shares of Covance common stock initially available for grant under the 2002 EEPP totaled approximately 325million plus approximately 09million shares
remaining available under the 2000 EEPP at the time the 2002 EEPP was approved. Effective upon approval of the 2002 EEPP, no further grants or awards were permitted under the 2000 EEPP. All grants and
awards under the 2000 EEPP remaining outstanding are now administered and paid in accordance with the provisions of the 2000 EEPP out of shares issuable under the 2002 EEPP. The Company issues
authorized but previously unissued shares when options are exercised or stock awards vest. At December31, 2006 there were approximately 37million shares remaining available for grants
or awards under the 2002 EEPP. 
Effective
January1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS123R using the modified prospective transition method. SFAS123R
revises SFAS123, supersedes APB 25 and amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No95, Statement of Cash Flows. Under the
modified prospective transition method, compensation expense is recognized in the financial statements on a prospective basis for aall share-based payments granted prior to, but not vested
as of January1, 2006, based upon the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS123, and bshare-based payments granted on
or subsequent to January1, 2006, based upon the grant-date fair value estimated in

with the provisions of SFAS123R. The grant-date fair value of awards expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the
related awards. Under the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods are not restated. 
As
a result of the adoption of SFAS123R, both income from operations and income before taxes for the year ended December31, 2006 include incremental stock-based
compensation expense of $155million. For the year ended December31, 2006, the after tax impact of this incremental stock-based compensation expense on net income, basic and diluted
earnings per share was $106million, $017 and $016, respectively. Results of operations for the year ended December31, 2006 include $215million $145million net of
tax benefit of $70million of total stock-based compensation expense, $70million of which has been included in cost of revenue and $145million of which has been included in
selling, general and administrative expenses. 
Prior
to January1, 2006, Covance followed the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS123 and, accordingly, accounted for awards under its share based compensation
plans pursuant to the recognition and measurement principles of APB 25 and related Interpretations, as permitted by SFAS123. Under APB 25, compensation expense was recognized in the financial
statements for the fair value of stock awards. However, no compensation expense was recorded in the financial statements for stock option grants, as all options have been granted with an exercise
price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Additionally, no compensation expense was recorded in the financial statements for shares purchased by employees
under the Company Employee Stock Purchase Program as that plan was
considered to be non-compensatory under APB 25. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004 had

10.Stockholders' Equity Continued  OptionsThe grant-date fair value of stock option awards is estimated using an option
pricing model. For stock options granted prior to January1, 2006, the Company used the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the grant-date fair value of such
awards. For stock options granted on or subsequent to January1, 2006, the Company is using the Lattice-Binomial option pricing formula to estimate the grant-date fair value of
stock option awards. The Company changed to the Lattice-Binomial option pricing formula as it believes such formula may result in a better estimate of fair value than the Black-Scholes-Merton formula.
In order to estimate the grant-date fair value, option pricing models require the use of estimates and assumptions as to athe expected term of the option, bthe expected
volatility of the price of the underlying stock, cthe risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option and dpre-vesting forfeiture rates. The
expected term of the option is based upon the contractual term, taking into account
expected employee exercise and expected post-vesting employment termination behavior. The expected volatility of the price of the underlying stock is based upon the historical volatility
of the Company stock computed over a period of time equal to the expected term of the option. The risk free interest rate is based upon the implied yields currently available from the U.S. Treasury
zero-coupon yield curve for issues with a remaining duration equal to the expected term of the option. Pre-vesting forfeiture rates are estimated based upon past voluntary
termination behavior and past option forfeitures. The
following table sets forth the weighted-average assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: 2006

flow in the Statements of Cash Flows in accordance with SFAS123 and APB 25. For the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, the tax benefit realized and included in operating cash flows
totaled $117million and $162million, respectively. SFAS123R requires that the cash flows resulting from tax benefits realized on tax deductions in excess of the
compensation expense recognized either in the financial statements or the pro forma footnote disclosures for stock options exercised in the period be classified as a financing cash flow. The excess
tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow during the year ended December31, 2006 was $74million and would have been classified as an operating cash inflow under
SFAS123. The actual tax benefit realized on stock options exercised during the year ended December31, 2006 was $128million. The difference between the actual tax benefit
received and the excess
tax benefit computed in accordance with SFAS123R of $54million continues to be classified as an operating cash inflow. Restricted Stock AwardsRestricted stock awards are granted subject to certain restrictions, including in some cases service
conditions restricted stock and in other cases service and performance conditions performance-based shares. The grant-date fair value of restricted stock and performance-based share
awards, which has been determined based upon the market value of Covance shares on the grant date, is expensed over the vesting period. The

Employee Stock Purchase PlanCovance also has an employee stock purchase plan the ESPP pursuant to which Covance may make
available for sale to employees shares of its common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the market value on the first or last day of each calendar quarter. The ESPP, administered by the
Compensation Committee, is intended to give Covance employees the opportunity to purchase shares of Covance common stock through payroll deductions. A maximum of 30million shares may be
purchased by Covance employees under the ESPP. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, a total of 92,927 shares, 102,501 shares and 116,701 shares of common stock, respectively, were issued under the ESPP. At
December31, 2006, there were approximately 09million shares remaining for purchase under the ESPP. 
11.Commitments and Contingencies 
Covance is obligated under non-cancelable operating leases, primarily for its offices and laboratory facilities. These leases generally
contain
customary scheduled rent increases or escalation clauses and renewal options. Covance is also obligated under outsourcing agreements related to certain aspects of its information technology and human
resources support functions and purchase commitments related to the completion of ongoing facility expansions, both of which are reflected under the purchase obligations caption in the table below.
Actual amounts paid under these outsourcing agreements could be higher or lower than the amounts shown below as a result of changes in volume and other variables. In addition, early termination of
these outsourcing agreements by Covance could result in the payment of termination fees which are not reflected in the table below. Year ending December 31 2007

12.Segment Information 
Covance has two reportable segments: early development and late-stage development. Early development services, which includes Covance
preclinical
and clinical pharmacology service capabilities, involve evaluating a new compound for safety and early effectiveness as well as evaluating the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the
compound in the human body. It is at this stage that a pharmaceutical company, based on available data, will generally decide whether to continue further development of a drug. Late-stage
development services, which include Covance central laboratory, clinical development, cardiac safety services, periapproval and market access services, are geared toward demonstrating the clinical
effectiveness of a compound in treating certain diseases or conditions,
obtaining regulatory approval and maximizing the drug commercial potential. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note2.
