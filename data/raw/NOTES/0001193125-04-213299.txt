Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  The Board of Directors and Stockholders Keynote Systems, Inc.:  We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Keynote Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of September 30, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive income
loss, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2004. In connection with our audits of the financial statements, we have also audited the financial statement schedule listed in a2. These
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based
on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Keynote
Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.  As discussed in note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets on October 1, 2001.  /s/KPMG LLP  Mountain View, California December 10, 2004

Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  1The Company  Keynote Systems, Inc. was incorporated on June 15, 1995 in California and reincorporated in Delaware on March 31, 2000. Keynote Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company provide e-business performance measurement services
and performance management solutions that enable corporate enterprises to improve e-business performance by reducing costs, improving customer satisfaction and increasing profitability.  2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  ABasis of Presentation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America GAAP. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Significant intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  BRevenue Recognition  Revenue consists of subscription services revenue and consulting and support
services revenue. Subscription services revenue consists of fees from subscriptions to the Companys e-business performance measurement services and performance management services. Subscription services revenue also consists of the
subscription to use our technology for our webeffective intelligence platform. Subscription services revenue is deferred upon invoicing and is recognized ratably over the service period, commencing on the day service is provided, generally ranging
from one to twelve months. Subscription revenue related to the use of the Webeffective Intelligence Platform to conduct evaluations is recognized upon completion of each evaluation. For some customers, subscription services revenue is invoiced
monthly upon completion of the services. Deferred revenue is comprised of all unearned revenue that has been collected in advance, primarily unearned subscription services revenue, and is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until the
revenue is earned. Any uncollected deferred revenue reduces the balance of accounts receivable. The Company does not generally grant refunds. All discounts granted reduce revenue. Revenue is not recognized for free trial periods. Consulting and
support services revenue consists of fees generated by the Companys consulting and support services, and is recognized as the services are performed, typically over a period of one to three months. For consulting projects that span more than
one month, the Company recognizes revenue as milestones or deliverables are completed.  CUse of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements relate to the allowance for doubtful
accounts and billing allowance and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  DCash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
52 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
EShort-Term Investments  The Company classifies all of its short-term investments as
available-for-sale. These investments mature in two years or less, and consist of investment-grade corporate and government debt securities with Moodys ratings of A2 or better. Investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair
market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a component of stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses are recorded based on specific identification. The Company
realized a gain of approximately $7,000 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2004. The Company did not have any realized gains or losses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002.  FProperty and Equipment  Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally three years. Equipment under capital leases is amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of
the equipment or the lease term. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term. The carrying values of the land and building associated with the Companys headquarters were
reduced to their fair market values as of September 30, 2002 based on an independent appraisal report. The actual acquisition cost of the land and building was higher than its fair market value because the Company acquired the building pursuant to a
synthetic lease arrangement which provided for a residual guarantee of $850 million. The cost of the building is being depreciated over a thirty year life.  GAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income Loss  Comprehensive income loss includes net income loss, unrealized gains and losses on short-term investments in debt
securities and foreign currency translation. The unrealized gains and losses on short-term investments in debt securities and foreign currency translation are excluded from earnings and reported as a component of stockholders equity. The
functional currency of the Companys foreign operations is the applicable local currency or United States dollar. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are reflected in interest and other expenses in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations as incurred.  HFinancial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk  The carrying value of the Companys financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts
payable and accrued expenses, and capital lease obligation, approximates fair market value due to their short-term nature. Financial instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable.  Credit risk is concentrated in North America, but exists in Europe as well. The Company generally requires no collateral from customers; however, throughout the collection process, it conducts an ongoing evaluation of customers
ability to pay. The Companys accounting for its allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical trends, experience and current market and industry conditions. Management regularly reviews the adequacy of the Companys
allowance for doubtful accounts by considering the aging of accounts receivable, the age of each invoice, each customers expected ability to pay and the Companys collection history with each customer. Management reviews invoices greater
than 60 days past due to determine whether an allowance is appropriate based on the receivable balance. In addition, the Company maintains a reserve for all other invoices, which is calculated by applying a percentage to the outstanding accounts
receivable balance, based on historical collection trends. In addition to the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company maintains a billing allowance 
53 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
which represents the reserve for potential billing adjustments that are recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Companys accounting for billing
allowance represents a percentage of revenue based on historical trends and experience.  The allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance represent managements best current estimate, but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable and billing adjustments, including unforeseen
declines in market conditions and collection rates and the number of billing adjustments, may result in additional allowances or recoveries in the future. The Company believes that it has adequately reserved for doubtful accounts and potential
billing adjustments as of the date of each balance sheet presented herein.  At September 30, 2004 and 2003, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys total accounts receivable. For the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002, no single customer accounted for
more than 10% of total revenue. For the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002, 34%, 30% and 29% of total revenue was generated by ten customers, respectively.  IExcess Occupancy Costs  Excess occupancy costs are fixed costs associated with the unoccupied portion of the Companys headquarters building,
such as property taxes, insurance and depreciation. These particular costs represent the fixed costs of operating the Companys headquarters building acquired in September 2002 and are based on the actual unoccupied square footage, which was
determined to be 60% during the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and 70% for the last three months for the year ended September 30, 2003 and twelve months ended September 30, 2004, respectively.  JGoodwill and Identifiable Purchased Intangible
Assets  Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of
an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed. Identifiable purchased intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over a three-or four year period. Prior to
October 1, 2001, goodwill was also amortized on a straight-line basis over a three-year period. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which was adopted on October 1, 2001, requires that goodwill and purchased intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful
lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.  Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company reassessed the useful lives and residual values of all acquired identifiable
intangible assets to identify any necessary amortization period adjustments and to determine, if any, other intangible assets should be reclassified to goodwill. Based on that assessment, no adjustments were made to the amortization period or
residual values of identifiable intangible assets. The Company recorded a $32 million non-cash impairment charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended September 30, 2002. See Note 3 and Note 6 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.  Amortization of identifiable intangible assets was $17 million, $16 million, and $11 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.  The Company reviews its long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, for impairment periodically and
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.

KStock-Based Compensation  The Company accounts for stock option grants under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No. 123, which permits the use of the intrinsic-value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. No compensation expense is recognized on the grant date when the option exercise price equals or exceeds the market price of the underlying common stock. See Note 8
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.  As
required under SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation on net income loss and income loss per share for employee stock options granted and employee stock purchase plan share purchases have been estimated at the date of
grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to pro forma net income loss over the options vesting period.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use
in estimating the fair value of freely traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of options and
the Companys expected stock price volatility. Because the Companys employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options, and because changes in
the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in managements opinion, the existing models do not provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Companys employee stock options.  The following table illustrates the effect on net income loss and basic and
diluted net income loss per share if the Company had accounted for its stock option and stock purchase plans under the fair value method of accounting under SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
CompensationTransition and Disclosure in thousands, except per share amounts:  Year Ended September 30 2004 2003 2002 Net income loss, as reported 4,647 4,725 65,527 Add: Stock-based employee compensation included in net income loss 31 421 Less: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax

The amounts reflected as stock-based employee compensation included in pro forma net loss for the
years ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 have been revised from the historically reported amounts. The revision was required to correct an immaterial error in these amounts associated with the Companys April 2001 Stock Repurchase Program under
SFAS No. 123.  LIncome Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and
liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that the
Company expects to realize.  MResearch and Development  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, in accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
Marketed. To date, the Companys service offerings have been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, no research and development costs have been capitalized.
NNet Income Loss Per Share
Basic net income loss per share is computed using the
weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock excluding shares of restricted stock subject to repurchase, summarized below. Diluted net income loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding and, when dilutive, potential shares from options to purchase common stock using the treasury stock method.  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted income loss per share:  Year Ended September 30 2004

The weighted-average
exercise price of excluded outstanding stock options was $2527, $1261, and $1258, for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The weighted-average purchase price of restricted stock was $206, $206, and $109, for the
years ended September 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.  OAdvertising Costs  All advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were approximately $168,000, $598,000 and $13 million for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.  PRecent Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached
consensus on Issue No. 03-01 EITF 03-01, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. EITF 03-01 includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on debt and
equity investments, as well as new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03-1-1, which delays the effective date until additional guidance is
issued for the application of the recognition and measurement provisions of EITF 03-01 to investments in securities that are impaired; however, the disclosure requirements are effective for annual periods ending after June 15, 2004. Although the
Company will continue to monitor the application of EITF 03-01, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.  In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC
issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition, which supersedes SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. The primary purpose of SAB No. 104 is to rescind accounting guidance
contained in SAB No. 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements, superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Additionally, SAB No. 104 rescinds the SECs
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements Frequently Asked Questions and Answers the FAQ issued with SAB No. 104 that had been codified in SEC Topic 13, Revenue Recognition. Selected portion of the FAQ have
been incorporated into SAB No. 104. While the wording of SAB No. 104 has changed to reflect the issuance of EITF Issue No. 00-21, the revenue recognition principles of SAB No. 101 remain largely unchanged by the issuance of SAB No. 104. The adoption
of SAB No. 104 did not have a material impact on the its reported results.  3Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle  As described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesGoodwill and Identifiable Purchased Intangible Assets, the Company
adopted SFAS No. 142, effective October 1, 2001. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. 
57 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
SFAS No. 142 provides a six-month transitional period from the effective date of adoption for the
Company to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired. To accomplish this, the Company identified its reporting units and determined the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and
liabilities, including the existing goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, to those reporting units as of the date of adoption. The Company determined that it had one reporting unit as of October 1, 2001.  SFAS No. 142 required the Company to determine the fair value of its one
reporting unit as of October 1, 2001, and compare it to the reporting units carrying amount. To the extent that the reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting units goodwill may
be impaired and the Company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test. During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company performed the first step of the transitional impairment test required under SFAS No. 142, and
obtained an indicator of impairment in its single reporting unit. During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company performed the second step of the transitional impairment test. In the second step, in accordance with SFAS No. 141, the Company
compared the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill, determined by allocating the reporting units fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price
allocation to its carrying amount, both of which were measured as of the date of adoption. The Company determined the fair value of its single reporting unit using its market capitalization value after adjusting for a control premium and compared it
to its carrying value. The Company determined its market capitalization value based on the number of shares outstanding and the stock price as of October 1, 2001, adjusting for a 10% premium that is assumed to represent additional value that an
acquirer would be required to pay for a controlling interest in the Company. This evaluation indicated that goodwill associated with acquisitions completed prior to fiscal 2002 was impaired as of October 1, 2001. Accordingly, the Company recorded a
$32 million non-cash impairment charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the write-off goodwill as of October 1, 2001. The charge is reflected in the results for the year ended September 30, 2002. The goodwill recorded
on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2004 was $244 million, as compared to $195,000 as of September 30, 2003.  4Investments  The following table summarizes the Companys short-term investments in investment-grade debt securities as of September 30, 2004 in thousands:

identify possible impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the investee, and the Companys ability
and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value.  5Property and Equipment  Property and equipment, net, comprised the following in thousands:  UsefulLivesYears

Other accrued expenses 5,907 3,929 10,188 7,077  8Stockholders Equity  A1999 Equity Incentive Plan  In September 1999, the Company adopted the 1999 Equity Incentive Plan Incentive Plan. The Incentive Plan provides for the award of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards and stock bonuses.
Options may be exercisable only as they vest or may be immediately exercisable with the shares issued subject to the Companys right of repurchase that lapses as the shares vest. In general, options vest over a four-year period. As of September
30, 2004, the Company was authorized to issue up to approximately 99 million shares of common stock in connection with the Incentive Plan to employees, directors, and consultants, which includes options reserved for issuance under the
Companys 1996 and 1999 Stock Option Plans, which plans terminated upon the completion of the Companys initial public offering. As of September 30, 2004, options to purchase approximately 59 million shares were outstanding under the
Incentive Plan, and approximately 40 million shares have been reserved for future issuance.  Stock options granted prior to April 1999 were generally immediately exercisable subject to a restricted stock purchase agreement whereby the Company has the right to repurchase the unvested portion of the shares upon
the voluntary or involuntary termination of the purchasers employment with the Company at the original issuance cost. The Companys right of repurchase lapsed with respect to 25% of the shares after one year and ratably on a monthly basis
over the following three years. As of September 30, 2004, the Companys right of repurchased had lapsed for all shares granted prior to April 1999. However, as of September 30, 2004, approximately 2,331 shares of common stock issued upon
exercise of stock options assumed in connection with an acquisition were subject to repurchase at a weighted-average price of $206 per share.  Under the Incentive Plan, the exercise price for incentive stock options is at least 100% of the stocks fair market value on the date of the grant
for employees owning less than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock, and at least 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant for employees owning more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock. For nonqualified stock
options, the exercise price must be at least 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant for employees owning more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock and no less than 85% for employees owning less than 10% of the voting
power of all classes of stock. Options expire 10 years after the date of grant.  B1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan  In September 1999, the Company adopted the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Purchase Plan. The Company had reserved a total of
approximately 14 million shares of common stock for issuance under the Purchase Plan as of September 30, 2004. 
61 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
Under the Purchase Plan, eligible employees may defer an amount not to exceed 10% of the
employees compensation, as defined in the Purchase Plan, to purchase common stock of the Company. The purchase price per share is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of the applicable purchase period
or the last day of each purchase period. The Purchase Plan is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. As of September 30, 2004, approximately 550,000 shares had been issued
under the Purchase Plan, and approximately 873,000 shares had been reserved for future issuance.  CStock-Based Compensation  The Company issues stock options to its employees and outside directors and provides employees with stock purchase rights pursuant to stockholder approved
equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans. The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans under the intrinsic value method of accounting as defined by Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. Accordingly, no stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in operating expenses for the three years ended September 30, 2004, as all options granted under these plans had an exercise
price equal to or in excess of the fair market value of the underlying common stock as of the grant date for each stock option, except for certain stock options granted in fiscal 1999 or earlier, prior to the Companys initial public offering.
For those option grants in fiscal 1999 or earlier, the Company recorded deferred stock compensation of $19 million for the difference at the grant date between the exercise price of each stock option granted and the fair value of the underlying
common stock. This amount was being amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which was generally four years. As of September 30, 2004, the deferred stock compensation has been fully amortized.  The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. Weighted-average assumptions for options granted for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, are as follows:  2004 2003 2002 Volatility
336 386 590 Risk-free interest rates

3,132 1553  DStock Repurchase Plan  In January 2001, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of the Companys outstanding common stock on the open market from time to time as market conditions warrant. In October 2002, the
Companys Board of Directors increased the amount authorized for repurchase to an aggregate of $1300 million of the Companys outstanding common stock on the open market, less the amount paid for shares previously purchased. The Company
completed an issuer tender offer on November 26, 2002 and purchased approximately 43 million shares at a price of $800 per share for an aggregate price of approximately $346 million.  Additionally, the Company completed an issuer tender offer on May 16, 2003 and purchased approximately 43 million shares at
a price of $950 per share for an aggregate price of approximately $405 million. No repurchases occurred during the twelve months ended September 30, 2004.  In accordance with the January 2001 share repurchase authorization, the Company acquired 89 million, 12 million and 250,000 shares of common stock in
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The total number of shares repurchased since January 2001, including the tender offers described above, is approximately 104 million shares, for an aggregate price of approximately $901 million. The
Company currently has authorization to repurchase up to an additional of approximately $399 million of its common stock.  EStock Option Exchange Program 
In April 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock option exchange program. The Company offered its employees other than its Chief
Executive Officer, executive officers who report to the Chief Executive Officer, directors and non-exempt employees the opportunity to cancel certain stock options granted on or after September 24, 1999, with exercise prices above the then-current
market value of the Companys common stock, in exchange for new options to be granted at the then-fair market value on a date at least six months and one day after the options were cancelled. Options to purchase a total of approximately 12
million shares were cancelled pursuant to this program on May 8, 2001. On November 12, 2001, the Company granted new options to purchase a total of approximately 12 million shares at $752 per share.

FStockholder Rights Plan  On October 28, 2002, the Company announced that its Board of Directors
adopted a stockholder rights plan. The plan was amended on December 15, 2003. The plan is designed to protect the long-term value of the Company for its stockholders during any future unsolicited acquisition attempt. The rights become exercisable
only upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the plan, including the acquisition of 20% of the Companys outstanding common stock by a person or group. The Companys Board of Directors adopted a policy under which a committee
consisting solely of independent directors of the Board will review the Rights Agreement at least once every three years to consider whether maintaining the Rights Agreement continues to be in the best interests of Keynote and its stockholders. The
Board may amend the terms of the rights without the approval of the holders of the rights.  9Acquisitions  In September 2004, the Company acquired Vividence Corporation Vividence, a provider of web-based customer experience management for an initial cash payment of $20 million plus direct transaction costs of
$572,000. The initial purchase price of $200 million, payable in cash, was reduced by approximately $400,000 which represented the preliminary difference between Vividences total assets and liabilities net assets as of the
acquisition date after certain adjustments as defined in the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated September 10, 2004 Agreement and Plan. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan, the Company and Vividence will finalize and agree to an
amount representing the net assets as of the acquisition date by December 17, 2004. In the event that the Company and Vividence cannot agree to an amount representing the net assets as of the acquisition date by December 17, 2004, the matter will be
resolved by an independent accounting firm by January 16, 2005. Any difference in net assets as of the acquisition date will change the purchase price, however, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan, the initial purchase price cannot exceed $200
million. Any changes to purchase price will be recorded as a reduction or addition to goodwill. Additional contingent consideration payment of up to $6 million in cash could be made if certain revenue and profitability targets are achieved by the
acquired business through September 30, 2005. The Company believes that this acquisition will enhance and broaden its customer experience management solutions for enterprise customers as well as allow it to target e-business marketing executives
within Fortune 500 companies such as usability and market research managers.  The preliminary purchase price allocation was based on the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the acquisition date, including technology-based and customer-based intangible assets acquired.
The Company expects to finalize the initial purchase price allocation in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition in
thousands:  Cash 678 Accounts receivable 431 Prepaid and other assets 543 Property and equipment 86 Customer-based intangible assets 1,680 Technology-based intangible assets 2,780 In-process research and development 241 Goodwill 18,403 Liabilities assumed Line of credit 723 Deferred revenue 1,889 Accrued employee compensation 937 Other liabilities assumed 1,121 Total purchase price, including direct acquisition costs 20,172 
65 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
The in-process research and development expense of $241,000 for the year ended September 30, 2004
related to the estimated fair value of an acquired in-process research and development project in connection with the acquisition of Vividence. This project related to Vividences technology for its web-based customer research, had not yet
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use,. The estimated fair value of this project was determined based on the avoided cost approach as of the acquisition date where the fair value of the acquired technology is equal to
the costs which an acquirer will avoid spending in developing a similar functional technology. This amount was immediately expensed as of the acquisition date. 
The following summary, prepared on an unaudited pro-forma basis, reflects consolidated results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2004 and
2003, assuming Vividence had been acquired on October 1, 2002, in thousands, except per share data:  YearendedSeptember30,2004 YearendedSeptember30,2003 Revenue 51,487 47,579 Net loss 916 10,614 Net loss per sharebasic and diluted 005 048 Shares used in pro forma per share computationbasic and diluted 19,397 22,080
In July 2004, the
Company acquired Hudson Williams Corporation Hudson Williams, a provider of performance management and load testing consulting services for an initial cash payment of approximately $16 million and a cash payment of $332,000 as a
preliminary payment for the Hudson Williams estimated net assets as of the closing date. An additional cash payment of $231,000 was made in August 2004 based upon the final calculation of the Hudson Williams net assets as of the closing date. In
addition to the cash payments for the acquisition of Hudson Williams, the Company incurred direct acquisition costs of approximately $140,000. Pursuant to the merger agreement, an additional payment of approximately $240,000 will be paid in July
2005. The Company believes this acquisition will enhance and broaden its enterprise solutions group and provide customers in the northeast with more local access to Keynote expertise.  The purchase price allocation was based on the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the
acquisition date, including technology-based assets acquired. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition in thousands:  Cash 483 Accounts receivable 351 Prepaid and other assets 51 Property and equipment 4 Customer-based intangible assets 387 Goodwill 1,321 Liabilities assumed 54 Total purchase price, including direct acquisition costs 2,543  In April 2004, the
Company acquired NetRaker Corporation NetRaker, a provider of online customer experience management solutions that help e-business managers measure, evaluate and improve the design and navigability of their web sites. The total price
of approximately $37 million included a $26 million initial cash payment made in April 2004, a second payment of approximately $530,000 based on the final calculation of the 
66 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
NetRaker net assets as of the closing date, and approximately $553,000 of direct acquisition costs. An additional contingent consideration cash payment of up
to $89 million could be made if certain revenue and profitability targets are achieved by the acquired business during the twelve months ending March 31, 2005. The Company believes this acquisition will enhance and broaden its customer experience
management solutions for enterprise customers as well as allow it to target e-business marketing executives within Fortune 500 companies, such as usability and market research managers.  The purchase price allocation was based on the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the
acquisition date, including technology-based and customer-based intangible assets acquired. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition in thousands:  Cash 12 Accounts receivable 150 Prepaid and other assets 104 Property and equipment 20 Customer-based intangible assets 165 Technology-based intangible assets 512 Goodwill 4,122 Liabilities assumed 870 Deferred revenue 532 Total purchase price, including direct acquisition costs 3,683  In December 2003, the
Company acquired the business of the MatrixNet division of Xaffire, Inc. for $582,000 in cash. The MatrixNet service measures performance from network agent locations to a customers web infrastructure or devices. The preliminary purchase price
allocation was based on the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the business at the acquisition date, including the technology-based and customer-based intangible assets acquired. During the three months ended March 31, 2004, the
Company updated its preliminary purchase price allocation for the fair value of the property and equipment that were acquired as a result of the acquisition of the business of MatrixNet. Therefore, goodwill decreased by $34,000, from $306,000
initially recorded to $272,000.  The following table summarizes
the adjusted estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition in thousands:  Accounts receivable, net 55 Property and equipment 135 Customer-based intangible assets 43 Technology-based intangible assets 84 Goodwill 272 Deferred revenue 7 Total purchase price, including direct acquisition costs 582  In July 2003, the
Company acquired the business of Streamcheck, a provider of quality measurement services for streaming media, for $567,000 in cash, and an additional contingent consideration cash payment of up to $450,000 could be made if certain revenue and
profitability targets were achieved during the period from July 22, 2003 through September 30, 2004. Certain of the revenue and profitability targets were achieved and the Company estimates that a cash payment of $129,000 will be paid in January
2005. This additional payment has been recorded as an addition to goodwill as of September 30, 2004. 
67 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
The $567,000 purchase price consideration was based on estimated fair values of the assets and
liabilities of Streamcheck at the acquisition date, and allocated to the technology-based and customer-based intangible assets acquired. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the
date of acquisition in thousands:  Fixed assets 21

statement of operations includes activities relating to the acquisitions business activities subsequent to their respective acquisition dates.  Identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a three to four year period. Pro forma results of operations have not
been presented for Netraker, Hudson Williams, MatrixNet and Streamcheck because the effects of these acquisitions were not considered material to the consolidated financial statements.  10Lease Termination and Other Charges on Headquarters Building  In July 2000, the Company entered into a five-year synthetic lease
arrangement for its corporate headquarters building in San Mateo, California. On September 30, 2002, the Company terminated the lease by purchasing the property for a total of $857 million. The lease, which was due to expire in 2005, provided for a
residual guarantee of $850 million due at the end of the lease term or upon lease termination. The Companys obligation was fully collateralized with restricted cash of $850 million.  After the Company entered into the lease in July 2000, real estate market
conditions worsened, including a significant increase in available space for lease and significant declines in corresponding lease rates for commercial property. Accordingly, a loss on the termination of this lease was recognized in connection with
the purchase of the building. The loss was calculated by comparing the purchase price of the building to its fair value. To determine the fair value of the building, the Company had an independent real estate appraisal conducted, which indicated
that the fair value of the property was approximately $250 million. The calculated loss of approximately $607 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. The $607 million loss on termination was adjusted for the reversal of the
remaining excess facility charge accrual and costs associated with the acquisition of the building, resulting in a net charge to its consolidated statements of operations of approximately $520 million.  11Income Taxes  Income loss before income taxes is attributable to the following

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the Companys
deferred tax assets are presented below in thousands:  September 30 2004 2003 Deferred tax assets Accruals, reserves and other 2,070 1,504 State taxes 39 54 Intangibles related to acquisition 3,947 6,160 Net operating loss carryforwards 22,891 16,129 Property and equipment 23,495 23,964 Tax credit carryforwards 2,789 1,930 Gross deferred tax assets 55,231 49,741 Valuation allowance 55,231 49,741 Total deferred tax assets  Management has
established a valuation allowance for the portion of deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 was an increase of approximately $55
million and $154 million, respectively. The Companys accounting for deferred taxes under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of the Companys
deferred tax assets. To support the Companys conclusion that a 100% valuation allowance was required, management primarily considered such factors as the Companys recent history of operating losses, net income in 2004, the nature of the
Companys deferred tax assets and the absence of taxable income in prior carryback years. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax
assets will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon several factors, including the timing, likelihood and amount, if any, of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become
deductible, history of operating income or losses. At present, management does not believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized; accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established and no deferred
tax asset is shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  As of September 30, 2004, approximately $54 million of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is attributable to employee stock option deductions, the benefit from which will be recorded in additional paid-in capital if and when
subsequently realized.  As of September 30, 2004, approximately
$71 million of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is attributable to acquired companies, the benefit of which will reduce goodwill if and when realized.  Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because it is
managements intention to indefinitely reinvest such undistributed earnings outside the United States. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA includes a deduction of 85% of
certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. The Company may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in the future. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision;
however, the Company does not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after Congress or the Treasury Department provide additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision. The Company expects to complete its evaluation of
the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the publication of the additional clarifying language.

When the Company completes its evaluation, any changes in the current position on the repatriation of undistributed earnings could result in the recognition
of deferred tax liabilities at that time.  The Company has net
operating loss carryforwards for U.S. and foreign income tax purposes of approximately $59 million and $21 million, respectively, available to reduce future income subject to income taxes. The U.S. net operating loss carryforwards will begin to
expire, if not utilized, in the year 2011. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in the year 2005. In addition, the Company had approximately $255 million of net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future
taxable income, for state income tax purposes. The state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire, if not utilized, in the year 2005.  As of September 30, 2004, the Company had research credit carryforwards for both federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $15 million and
$22 million, respectively, available to reduce future income taxes. The federal research credit carryforwards begin to expire in the year 2010. The California research credit carryforwards expire indefinitely.  Federal and state tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization
of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for tax purposes, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company is currently in the process of determining whether ownership changes
have occurred. If an ownership change has occurred, the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be reduced significantly.  We establish liabilities or reserves when we believe that certain tax positions are likely to be challenged and we may not succeed, despite our belief
that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves, as well as related interest, in light of changing circumstances such as the progress of tax exams. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company recorded net
income tax benefits totaling $218,000 associated with the resolution of tax matters relating to a foreign subsidiary and U.S. state taxes.  12Commitments and Contingencies  ALeases  The Company leases certain of its facilities and equipment under noncancellable capital and operating leases, which expire on various dates through June

Rent expense for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was approximately $45,200 151,000, and $2,536,000, respectively.  BLegal Proceedings  Beginning on August 16, 2001, a number of class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, certain of its officers, and the underwriters of the Companys
initial public offering. These lawsuits were essentially identical, and were brought on behalf of those who purchased the Companys securities between September 24, 1999 to August 19, 2001. These complaints alleged generally that the
underwriters in certain initial public offerings, including the Companys, allocated shares in those initial public offerings in unfair or unlawful ways, such as requiring the purchaser to agree to buy in the aftermarket at a higher price or to
buy shares in other companies with higher than normal commissions. The complaint also alleged that the Company had a duty to disclose the activities of the underwriters in the registration statement relating to its initial public offering. In June
2003, the plaintiffs counsel and the issuer defendants counsel reached a settlement agreement whereby the issuers and individual defendants were dismissed from the case, without any payments by the Company. The settlement awaits approval
by the Court.  The Company is subject to legal proceedings,
claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on
the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  13Geographic and Segment Information  The Company has determined that it operates in a single reportable operating segment: the development and sale of services to measure, test, assure and
improve the quality of service of e-business.  The Company
markets its products primarily from its operations in the United States. International sales are primarily to customers in Europe. These sales and the Companys foreign-owned assets are not significant. At September 30, 2004 and 2003, no single
customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys total accounts receivable. For the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys total revenue.
