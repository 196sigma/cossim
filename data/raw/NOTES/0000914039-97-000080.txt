REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of Transact Technologies Incorporated
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of income, of cash flows and of changes
in shareholders' equity present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Transact Technologies Incorporated and its
subsidiaries, as described in Note 1, at December 31, 1996 and 1995,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year
ended December 31, 1996, the nine months ended December 31, 1995 and
the year ended April 1, 1995 and their changes in shareholders' equity
for the period from August 22, 1996 through December 31, 1996, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for the opinion expressed above.     Price Waterhouse LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Transact Technologies Incorporated Transact or the Company was
incorporated on June 17, 1996, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tridex
Corporation Tridex. Following the incorporation, Transact and two of
Tridex wholly-owned subsidiaries, Magnetec Corporation Magnetec and Ithaca
Peripherals Incorporated Ithaca, entered into a Plan of Reorganization the
Plan of Reorganization, pursuant to which: i Ithaca merged into Magnetec;
ii Transact transferred to Tridex certain assets of Magnetec used in
manufacturing a printer ribbon product line; iii Transact issued 5,400,000
shares of its common stock to Tridex in exchange for all the outstanding shares
of Magnetec; iv Transact sold in an initial public offering the Offering
1,322,500 shares or approximately 197% of its common stock; v Transact repaid
$8,500,000 of intercompany indebtedness to Tridex; vi Tridex applied to the
Internal Revenue Service the IRS for a ruling that the distribution of the
5,400,000 shares of Transact owned by Tridex to Tridex stockholders the
Distribution would constitute a tax-free reorganization for federal income
tax purposes; and vii Tridex agreed to effect the Distribution promptly after
receipt of a favorable ruling from the IRS and the satisfaction of certain other
conditions.
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared principally on
the basis of items i and ii of the Plan of Reorganization outlined above and
include the financial position and consolidated combined prior to the
implementation of the Plan of Reorganization results of operations and cash
flows of the business described. The term consolidated as used herein refers to
both the consolidated and combined financial statements. The Company carries its
assets and liabilities at historical cost. The financial results in these
financial statements are not necessarily indicative of results that would have
occurred if the Company had been a separate stand alone entity during the
periods presented or of future results of the Company. 2.  BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS: Transact, through its two operating units, Magnetec
and Ithaca, operates in one industry segment, printer peripheral equipment.
Transact designs, develops, manufactures and markets transaction based printers
and related products under the ITHACA and MAGNETEC brand names. The Company
printers are used to provide transaction records such as receipts, tickets,
coupons, register journals and other documents. The Company focuses on four
vertical markets: point-of-sale POS from which the Company derived
approximately 51% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 1996; gaming and
lottery approximately 29% of net sales; financial services approximately 12%
of net sales; and kiosk approximately 8% of net sales. The Company sells its
products directly to end users, original equipment manufacturers OEM, value
added resellers and selected distributors, primarily in the United States,
Canada and Europe.
Transact manufactures and sells customizable and custom dot matrix and
thermal printers for applications requiring up to 60 character columns in each
of its four vertical markets. The Company also sells an 80 column laser printer
for kiosk applications. The Company customizable products include several
series of printers which offer customers the ability to choose from a variety of
features and functions. Options typically include print speeds, paper handling
capacities and numbers of print stations. In addition to its customizable
printers, Transact manufactures custom printers for certain OEM customers. In
collaboration with these customers, the Company provides engineering and
manufacturing expertise for the design and development of specialized printers.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, after elimination of all material intercompany accounts and
transactions.
CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR END: In December 1995, the Company fiscal year end
was changed to December 31 from the Saturday closest to March 31.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: The Company considers all highly liquid
investments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents.
USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2. BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
FOREIGN CURRENCY: The financial position and results of operations of the
Company foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the
functional currency. Assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries have been
translated at end of period exchange rates, and related revenues and expenses
have been translated at weighted average exchange rates. The aggregate effect of
translation adjustments so calculated for periods prior to the Offering, which
would be ordinarily included as a separate component of shareholders' equity, is
de minimis. Transaction gains and losses are included in other income.
INVENTORIES: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally
first-in, first-out or market.
PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION: Plant and equipment and leasehold
improvements are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided for primarily by the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life
of machinery, furniture and equipment is five to ten years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the
useful life of the asset. Depreciation amounted to $905,000, $521,000 and
$650,000 in the year ended December 31, 1996, the nine months ended December 31,
1995 and the year ended April 1, 1995, respectively.
EXCESS OF COST OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED: The excess of cost
over fair value of net assets acquired goodwill resulted from the acquisition
of Ithaca in fiscal year 1991. The original amount applicable to this
acquisition totaled $3,536,000 and is being amortized on the straight line
method over 20 years. Accumulated amortization of goodwill was $1,290,000 and
$1,118,000 at December 31, 1996 and December 31, 1995, respectively. The Company
periodically reviews goodwill to assess recoverability based upon expectations
of non-discounted cash flows from operations for Ithaca. The Company believes
that no impairment of goodwill exists at December 31, 1996.
OTHER ASSETS: At December 31, 1995, other current assets includes marketable
securities available for sale, accounted for at market value of $309,000, with
an unrealized gain of $86,000, net of related tax effect of $29,000, recorded as
a component of stockholder equity.
REVENUE RECOGNITION: Sales are recognized when the product is shipped.
Revenue from extended warranty and maintenance agreements is recognized over the
term of such agreements as services are performed. Sales to one customer
accounted for approximately 16% and 12% of net sales for the year ended December
31, 1996 and the nine months ended December 31, 1995, respectively. A different
customer accounted for approximately 14% of net sales in the year ended April 1,
1995.
INCOME TAXES: Through the date of the Distribution, the Company will be
included in the consolidated federal and certain state income tax returns of
Tridex. Effective April 4, 1993, Tridex adopted FAS 109 Accounting for Income
Taxes, which mandates the liability method for computing deferred income taxes.
The income tax amounts reflected in the accompanying financial statements are an
allocation of Tridex consolidated balances, and are computed as if a separate

On July 31, 1996, the Company entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement with
Tridex. The agreement provides for the treatment of certain tax attributes of
the Company including the method of allocating tax obligations, treatment of tax
carryforwards and the computation of income tax provisions for the Company
between the date of the Offering and the Distribution. For the year ended
December 31, 1996, the Company paid approximately $527,000 to Tridex pursuant to
the agreement.
The Company and Tridex also entered into an Asset Transfer Agreement dated
July 31, 1996, under which the Company agreed to transfer to Tridex certain
assets used in the manufacturing process of the printer ribbon product line.
Additionally, on September 28, 1996, the Company and Tridex entered into a
Manufacturing Support Services Agreement. Under this agreement, the Company
agrees to provide Tridex with space within its Wallingford, Connecticut

calculated to compensate the Company for the direct and indirect costs incurred
by the Company to provide the space and render such services. These fees

Company also purchased approximately $5,000 of ribbons from Tridex during the
same period.

percentage points over the market rate. The Credit Facility is secured by a lien
on substantially all of the assets of the Company, imposes certain financial
covenants including, among other things, a minimum tangible net worth, a maximum
leverage ratio, a minimum current ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio
and restricts the payment of cash dividends and the creation of liens. The
Company had no borrowings under the Credit Facility during 1996.
9.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
At December 31, 1996, the Company was lessee on operating leases for

The Company has a long-term purchase agreement for certain printer
components. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company receives favorable
pricing for volume purchases over the life of the contract. In the event
anticipated purchase levels are not achieved, the Company would be subject to
retroactive price increases on previous purchases. Management currently
anticipates achieving sufficient purchase levels to maintain the favorable
prices.
In conjunction with the Plan of Reorganization, as described in Note 1,
Tridex indemnified the Company from any liabilities, including environmental
liabilities, which could arise in connection with a manufacturing facility owned
by Tridex and formerly operated by the Company.
