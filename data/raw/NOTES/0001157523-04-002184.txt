32 TRIPATH TECHNOLOGY INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1THE COMPANY AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION The Company Tripath
Technology Inc. the Company or Tripath was incorporated in California in July1995. The Company
was reincorporated in Delaware in July2000. The Company designs, develops and markets integrated
circuit devices for the Consumer Electronics, DSL and Wireless markets. On August1, 2000,
the Company completed its initial public offering of 5 million shares of common stock at $1000 per
share. Basis of Presentation The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tripath and its wholly owned subsidiary, Tripath
Technology Japan Ltd. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Accounts
denominated in foreign currency have been remeasured using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences could affect the results of operations
reported in future periods and such differences could be material. Liquidity The
Companys consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern, which
contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
The Company has incurred substantial losses and has experienced negative cash flow since inception and
has an accumulated deficit of $1796 million at December 31, 2003.  Beginning in August 2001, the Company instituted programs to reduce expenses including reducing headcount
from 144 employees at the end of July 2001 to 56 employees at the end of December 2003 and reducing
employees salaries by 10%. In September 2002 the Company relocated its headquarters which reduced rent
expense and canceled its DO policy which reduced insurance expense. These actions resulted in significant
cost savings in 2003. The Company reduced its cash used in operating activities from approximately $13
million in 2002 to approximately $4 million in 2003. During 2003, warrants were exercised which resulted in the Company receiving proceeds totaling approximately
$31 million. At December 31, 2003, the Company had working capital of $112 million, including cash
of $96 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2003 the Company received proceeds of approximately $23
million from the exercise of outstanding warrants. Should
the Company require more cash during 2004 to fund its operations than is currently planned, management
believes that such additional cash requirements could be met by first obtaining additional financing
or by taking measures to reduce operating expenses such as reducing headcount or canceling research
and development projects. However, the Company may not be able to obtain additional funds on terms that
would be favorable to its stockholders and the Company, or at all. The Companys long term prospects
are dependent upon obtaining sufficient financing as needed to fund current working capital needs and
future growth, and ultimately on achieving profitability. The
Company believes that its existing working capital at December 31, 2003, together with subsequent proceeds
recovered from exercise of options and warrants will be sufficient to meet its operating, working capital,
investing and financing needs for at least the next twelve months until fiscal 2005. The Company has
not made any adjustment to its consolidated financial statements as a result of the outcome of the uncertainty
described above. Foreign Currency Translation The
U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the Companys Japanese wholly-owned subsidiary. Assets and
liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency are remeasured into U.S. dollars and
the resulting gains or losses are included in Interest and other income, net. Such gains or losses
have not been material for any period presented.
33 NOTE 2SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Revenue Recognition The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin
No104 SAB 104, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. The Company recognizes
revenue when all of the following criteria are met: 1 there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement
exists, 2 delivery of goods has occurred, 3 the sales price is fixed or determinable, and 4 collectibility
is reasonably assured. The following policies apply to the Company major categories of revenue
transactions. Sales to OEM Customers: Under the
Companys standard terms and conditions of sale, title and risk of loss transfer to the customer at
the time product is delivered to the customer, FOB shipping point, and revenue is recognized accordingly.
The Company accrues the estimated cost of post-sale obligations, including basic product warranties
or returns, based on historical experience. The Company has experienced minimal warranty or other
returns to date. Sales to Distributors: The Company provides
its distributors certain incentives such as stock rotation, price protection, and other offerings.
As a result of these incentives, the Company defers recognition of revenue until such time that the
distributor sells product to its customer. Costs related to shipping and handling are included
in cost of revenue for all periods presented. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The
Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure trade receivables are not overstated due
to uncollectibility. The collectibility of the Companys receivables is evaluated based on a variety
of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, indication of the customers willingness
to pay, significant one-time events and historical experience. An additional reserve for individual
accounts is recorded when the Company becomes aware of a customer inability to meet its financial
obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or substantial deterioration in the customer
operating results or financial position. If circumstances related to the Companys customers change,
estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less from the date
of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks,
money market funds and commercial paper, bonds and notes, the fair value of which approximates cost. The
following table summarizes the Companys cash and cash equivalents in thousands December 31 2003 2002 Cash and cash equivalents Cash 1,480 394 Money market funds 7,471 9,718 8,951 10,112 The
Company entered into a credit facility with a financial institution that had certain restrictions in
the borrowing base. The credit facility was used to issue standby letters of credit to collateralize
the Companys obligations to a third party for the purchase of inventory and to provide a security deposit
for the lease of new office space. The amount by which the aggregate face amount of all outstanding
stand-by letters of credit exceeded the borrowing base, as determined by eligible receivables, represented
the amount of restricted cash necessary to secure the standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2002,
the Company had $486,000 in restricted cash. The credit facility expired on June 30, 2003 and
was not renewed. Upon the expiration of the credit agreement on June 30, 2003, the Company entered into
a Pledge and Security Agreement to provide a security interest in a money market account in the amount
of $07 million for the standby letters of credit, which totaled $07 million at December 31, 2003. 34 Fair value of financial instruments Carrying
amounts of certain of the Companys financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable and accounts payable, approximate their fair values due to their relative short maturities
and based upon comparable market information available at the respective balance sheet dates. The Company
does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Concentration of credit risk and significant
customers Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily
of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Substantially all of the Companys cash and cash
equivalents are invested in highly-liquid money market funds. The Company sells its products through
distributors and directly to original equipment manufacturers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations
of its customers and maintains an allowance for potential credit losses, as considered necessary by
management. Credit losses to date have been consistent with managements estimates. During the years
ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, the Company wrote-off bad debts which had previously
been reserved totaling approximately $295,000 and $622,000, respectively. The Company had no significant
write-offs or recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2001. The
following table summarizes sales to end customers comprising 10% or more of the Companys total revenue
for the periods indicated ofRevenuefortheYear
Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Customer A 24 Customer B 18 Customer C 15 31 25 Customer D 19 Customer E 29 Customer F 13 Customer G 12 The
Companys accounts receivable were concentrated with five customers at December 31, 2003 representing
49%, 19%, 15%, 6% and 5% of aggregate gross receivables, five customers at December 31, 2002 representing
17%, 16%, 14%, 14% and 14% of aggregate gross receivables, and five customers at December 31, 2001 representing
15%, 15%, 13%, 12%, and 12% of aggregate gross receivables. Inventories Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market. This policy requires the Company to make estimates regarding
the market value of the Companys inventory, including an assessment of excess or obsolete inventory.
The Company determines excess and obsolete inventory based on an estimate of the future demand and estimated
selling prices for the Companys products within a specified time horizon, generally 12 months. The
estimates the Company uses for expected demand are also used for near-term capacity planning and inventory
purchasing and are consistent with the Companys revenue forecasts. Actual demand and market conditions
may be different from those projected by the Companys management. If the Companys unit demand forecast
is less than the Companys current inventory levels and purchase commitments, during the specified time
horizon, or if the estimated selling price is less than the Companys inventory value, the Company will
be required to take additional excess inventory charges or write-downs to net realizable value which
will decrease the Companys gross margin and net operating results in the future. During the quarter
ended March 31, 2002, the Company recorded a provision for excess inventory of approximately $5 million
related to excess inventory for the Companys TA2022 product as a result of a decrease in forecasted
sales for this product. Inventory purchase commitment losses The
Company accrues for estimated losses on non-cancelable purchase orders. The estimated losses result
from anticipated future sale of products for sales prices less than the estimated cost to manufacture.
Inventory purchase commitment losses accrued at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $0, $38,000 and
$190,000, respectively.
35 Research and development expenses Research
and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Property and equipment Property
and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method
over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the term of the lease. Depreciation
is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows Furniture and fixtures
5 years Software
Shorter of three years or term of license Equipment
2-5 years Long-lived
assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the sum
of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and before interest from the use of the assets is less
than the net book value of the asset. The amount of the impairment loss, if any, will generally be measured
as the difference between net book value of the assets and their estimated fair values. Comprehensive income Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, establishes standards
for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general-purposes
financial statements. There was no difference between the Companys net loss and its total comprehensive
loss for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Accounting for stock-based compensation At
December 31, 2003, the Company has two stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described
more fully in Note 7. The Company accounts for those plans under the recognition and measurement
principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations.
No stock-based employee compensation cost related to stock options is reflected in net income for the
three years ended December 31, 2003, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price
equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The following table
illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
to stock-based employee compensation. Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Net loss applicable to common stockholders, as reported 7,215 34,266 26,981 Total stock-based employee compensation expense included in the net loss, determined under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No25, net of related tax effects 81 284 260 Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax effects 1211 1,527 5,625 Proforma net loss applicable to common stockholders 8,507 36,077 32,346 As reported 017 088 100 Proforma 020 093 120 36 The
fair value for these options was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Option pricing models require the input
of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Accordingly, option
pricing models may not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of options. The
fair value of options at the date of grant was estimated on the date of grant based on the method prescribed
by SFAS No. 123. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of options and assumptions
used in the SFAS No. 123 calculations for stock option plans Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Estimated fair value 073 014 221 Expected lives in years 5 5 5 Volatility 157 110 110 Risk-free interest rate 296 383 456 Dividend yield The

Company has determined that it has one reportable business segment: the design, license and marketing

January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,
an Interpretation of ARB No. 51 FIN 46, which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of
variable interest entities VIEs either: 1 that do not have sufficient equity investment at risk
to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or
2 in which the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest.
In December2003, the FASB completed deliberations of proposed modifications to FIN 46 Revised
Interpretations resulting in multiple effective dates based on the nature as well as the creation date
of the VIE. VIEs created after January31, 2003, but prior to January1, 2004, may be accounted
for either based on the original interpretation or the Revised Interpretations. However, the Revised
Interpretations must be applied no later than the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. VIEs created after
January1, 2004 must be accounted for under the Revised Interpretations. There has been no
material impact to the Companys consolidated financial statements from potential VIEs entered into
after January31, 2003 and there is no expected impact from the adoption of the deferred provisions
in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. In
June 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities SFAS 149. SFAS 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting
for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. SFAS 149 is effective for contracts entered
into or modified after June 30, 2003. The Company does not use derivative products and the adoption
of this statement had no material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In
June 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics
of both Liabilities and Equity SFAS 150. SFAS 150 establishes standards on the classification
and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
The provisions of SFAS 150 are effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May
31, 2003 and to all other instruments that exist as of the beginning of the first interim financial
reporting period beginning after June15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 150 did not have a material
impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position. In
December2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition SAB 104,
which codifies, revises and rescinds certain sections of SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition, in order
to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance
and SEC rules and regulations. The changes noted in SAB 104 did not have a material effect on the Companys
consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial position or consolidated cash flows. 38 Net loss per share Basic
net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders for the period
by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share
is computed based on the weighted average number of common stock and dilutive potential common stock
outstanding. The calculation of diluted net loss per share excludes potential common stock if the effect
is anti-dilutive. Potential common stock consist of incremental common stock issuable upon the exercise

July12, 2002, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a financial institution that provided
for a one-year revolving credit facility in an amount of up to $10million, subject to certain
restrictions in the borrowing base based on eligibility of receivables. The credit agreement expired
on June 30, 2003 and has not been renewed. NOTE 6COMMON STOCK The
Companys Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize the Company to issue 100,000,000
shares of common stock. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, there were 45,709,740 shares and 41,326,760 shares,
respectively, of common stock issued and outstanding. The
Company has reserved the following number of shares of common stock for future issuance in thousands December 31 2003 2002 2001 Common stock warrants 1,229 3,329 25 Common stock under Employee Stock Purchase Plan 322 349 413 Common stock upon exercise of outstanding stock options 8,501 7,535 7,117 10,052 11,213 7,555 40 On
January24, 2002, the Company completed a financing in which it raised $21million in gross
proceeds through a private placement of non-voting SeriesA Preferred Stock and warrants, at $30
per unit to a group of investors, which was convertible into 13,999,000 shares of common stock and warrants
to purchase 3,303,760 shares of common stock. Each share of SeriesA Preferred Stock was convertible
into 20 shares of Common Stock or an effective Common Stock price of $150 per share. Investors also
received warrants to purchase up to an additional 20percent of shares of SeriesA Preferred
Stock. The warrants have a term of three years and an exercise price equal to $3900 per share or an
effective Common Stock exercise price of $195 per share. At
a Special Meeting of Stockholders held on March7, 2002, the stockholders approved the issuance
and sale of 699,950 shares of SeriesA Preferred Stock and warrants. As a result, the Preferred
Stock and warrants automatically converted into 13,999,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase
3,303,760 shares of common stock. As
a result of the favorable conversion price of the preferred shares at the date of issuance, the Company
recorded accretion of approximately $15million thus increasing the net loss applicable to common
stockholders for the year ended December31, 2002 relating to the beneficial conversion feature
representing the difference between the accounting conversion price and the fair value of the common
stock on the date of the transaction, after valuing the warrants issued in connection with the financing
transaction. The Company valued the warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, applying
an expected life of threeyears, a weighted average risk-free rate of 361%, an expected dividend
yield of zero percent, a volatility of 130% and a deemed fair value of common stock of $235, which
was the value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. Stock Repurchase Program In
August 2002, the Companys Board of Directors approved a Stock Repurchase Program and authorized the
repurchase of up to one million shares of the Companys common stock in the open market over the next
year. No shares were repurchased under the Stock Repurchase Program. Common stock warrants In
connection with the financing that was completed on January 24, 2002, the Company issued warrants to
purchase 3,303,760 shares of the Companys common stock. This included unregistered warrants that were
issued to the placement agent for the financing transaction to purchase 503,960 shares of the Companys
common stock. The 2,799,800 registered warrants have a term of three years and an effective Common Stock
exercise price of $195 per share, whereas 419,968 of the 503,960 warrants issued to the placement agent
have an effective Common Stock exercise price of $150 per share. The remainder of the warrants issued
to the placement agent have an effective Common Stock exercise price of $195 per share. During
the year ended December 31, 2003, warrants were exercised which resulted in the issuance of 1,896,226
shares of the Companys common stock with proceeds to the Company totaling approximately $31 million.
These amounts included the exercise of warrants issued to the placement agent on a net issuance basis
resulting in 300,438 shares of the Companys common stock being issued to the placement agent. The
warrant agreement contained a provision for the mandatory exercise of the warrants if the Companys
common stock traded at $585 or higher for 20 out of 30 trading days. At the close of business on January
2, 2004 the Companys common stock had traded at $585 or higher for 20 consecutive days and the Company
was able to invoke the provision for the mandatory exercise of all outstanding warrants issued in connection
with the January 2002 financing. All outstanding warrants were exercised in January 2004 resulting in
the issuance of an additional 12 million shares of common stock. The Company received proceeds of approximately
$23 million from the exercise of these warrants. Restricted stock In April 2003, the Company issued 18 million shares of restricted stock, pursuant to the 2000 Stock
Plan. The Company determined the value of the restricted stock grant to be $324,000 by reference to
the quoted market price at the time of issuance and is amortizing this amount over two years. Compensation
expense related to the issuance of restricted stock was $108,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. 41 NOTE 7EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Stock Option Plans In
April2000, the Company adopted the 2000 Stock Option Plan the 2000 Plan. Upon adoption of
the 2000 Plan, shares reserved for issuance under the 1995 Stock Option Plan relating to ungranted options
were cancelled, and outstanding options under the 1995 Plan became subject to the 2000 Plan. The 2000
Plan authorizes the Board of Directors to grant incentive stock options ISOs and nonstatutory stock
options NSOs to employees, directors and consultants for up to 17,300,000 shares of common stock.
ISOs may be granted only to employees of the Company including officers and directors who are also
employees. NSOs may be granted to employees, non-employee directors and consultants of the Company.
No person will be eligible to receive more than 500,000 shares in any fiscal year pursuant to awards
under the 2000 Plan other than a new employee of the Company who will be eligible to receive no more
than 1,000,000 shares in the fiscal year in which such employee commences employment. Under
the 2000 Plan, ISOs and NSOs are granted at a price that is not to be less than 100% of the fair market
value of the common stock on the date of grant, as determined by the Board of Directors. Initial hire-on
stock options generally vest at 25% on the first anniversary date from the date of grant and then monthly
thereafter over the remaining 36 months. Subsequent discretionary stock options, generally vest equally
each month over 48 months. Options granted to shareholders who own more than 10% of the outstanding
stock of the Company at the time of grant must be issued at prices not less than 110% of the estimated
fair value of the stock on the date of grant. Options under the 2000 Plan may be granted for periods
up to 10 years. The

April2000 the Company adopted the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan under
which 500,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance. Eligible employees may elect to
withhold up to 15% of their salary to purchase shares of the Companys common stock at a price equal
to 85% of the market value of the stock at the beginning or ending of a six month offering period, whichever
is lower. No more than 5,000 shares may be purchased by an eligible employee during any calendar year.
The Purchase Plan will terminate in 2010. Under the Purchase Plan, 27,184, 64,606 and 86,566 shares
were issued during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. The
Company did not recognize compensation expense related to employee purchase rights in 2003, 2002 or
2001. 401k Plan The
Company sponsors a 401k Plan the 401k Plan which provides tax-deferred salary deductions for
eligible employees. Employees may contribute up to 15% of their annual compensation to the 401k Plan,
limited to a maximum annual amount as set periodically by the Internal Revenue Service. The 401k Plan
permits, but does not require, the Company to make matching contributions. To date, no such matching
contributions have been made. NOTE 8INCOME TAXES At
December 31, 2003, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax
purposes of approximately $106,000,000 and $35,000,000 respectively, which expire in varying amounts
beginning in 2005 through 2021. In addition, the Company has credit carryforwards of approximately $5,200,000
for federal and state purposes. The federal and state carryforwards expire in varying amounts through
2021. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of and benefits from net operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances. Events which could cause limitations
in the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that the Company may utilize in any one
year include, but are not limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50%, as defined, over
a three-year period. Deferred
taxes comprise the following in thousands December 31 2003 2002 Net operating loss carryforwards 38,108 36,533 Non-deductible reserves and accruals 2,433 2,163 Credit carryforwards 4,311 3,774 Capitalized research and development 2,849 2,089 Depreciation 226 185 Net deferred tax assets 47,927 44,744 Less: Valuation allowance 47,927 44,744 Net deferred tax assets 43 The
Company believes that, based on number of factors, the available objective evidence creates sufficient
uncertainty regarding the realizability of the deferred tax assets such that a full valuation allowance
has been recorded. These factors include the Companys history of losses, and relatively high expense
levels, the fact that the market in which the Company competes is intensely competitive and characterized
by rapidly changing technology, the lack of carryback capacity to realize deferred tax assets and the
uncertainty regarding market acceptance of the Companys products. The Company will continue to assess
the realizability of the deferred tax assets based on actual and forecasted operating results. NOTE 9COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease
commitments The
Company leases office space and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration
dates through 2007. Rent expense for operating leases was as follows in thousands Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Rent expense 837 1,812 1,583 On
