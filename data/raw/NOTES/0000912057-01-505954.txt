Report of Independent Public     23  Consolidated Balance     24  Consolidated Statements of     25  Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity.    26  Consolidated Statements of Cash     27  Notes to Consolidated Financial     28                    22           REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Shareholders of F.Y.I. Incorporated    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of F.Y.I.
Incorporated a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of
December 31, 1999 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of F.Y.I.
Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 2000, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.                           ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

27            F.Y.I. INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION     F.Y.I. Incorporated the Company or F.Y.I. was founded in
September 1994, to create a national, single source provider of document and
information outsourcing solutions to document and information intensive
industries, including: healthcare, law, banking, insurance, retailing, high
tech manufacturing and government. We acquired seven document management
services businesses the Founding Companies simultaneously with the closing
of our initial public offering the IPO on January 26, 1996, and effectively
began operations at that time. The consideration for the Founding Companies
consisted of a combination of cash and common stock the Common Stock of our
Company.
Since the IPO, we acquired nine companies in transactions that were
accounted for as poolings-of-interests: i The Rust Consulting Group, Inc.
Rust in December 1996; ii MAVRICC Management Systems, Inc. and a related
company, MMS Escrow and Transfer Agency, Inc. collectively, MAVRICC in
March 1997; iii Input of Texas, Inc. Input in March 1997; iv Micro
Publishing Systems, Inc. MPS in December 1997; v Lifo Systems, Inc.
Lifo in February 1998; vi Creative Mailings, Inc. CMI in September
1998; vii Economic Research Services ERS in October 1998; viii TCH
Mailhouse, Inc. and G Enterprise, Inc. collectively, TCH; in December
1998; and ix Advanced Digital Graphics, Inc. ADG in December 1998
collectively, the Pooled Companies. The consolidated financial statements
for all periods presented have been restated to include the accounts of CMI and
ERS. Periods presented were not restated prior to October 1, 1998, for the
acquisitions of TCH and ADG due to their financial immateriality. The Pooled
Companies and our Company were not under common control or management during
the periods prior to their respective mergers. The results of operations for
the periods presented may not be indicative of the results in the future
because of i the impact of acquisitions recorded as purchases, whose results
are only included subsequent to the purchase date; and ii the impact of
acquisitions recorded as poolings-of-interests, whose predecessor companies
were not under common control or management.
Subsequent to the IPO and through December 31, 2000, we acquired 50
additional companies in transactions accounted for as purchases. Our results of
operations include the results of these acquisitions from the date of their
respective acquisitions.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
We consider highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at
cost, which approximates market value.
FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
Our functional currency and that of all of our operating companies is
the U.S. dollar. Certain of our operating companies conduct transactions in
foreign currencies. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded
as other income and expense on the income statement.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the estimated
useful life or the term of the lease.                    28 INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangibles consist primarily of goodwill. Based on the historical
profitability of the purchased companies and trends in the legal, healthcare
and other industries regarding the outsourcing of document management
functions in the foreseeable future, goodwill is being amortized over periods
not to exceed 30 years. Management continually evaluates whether events and
circumstances indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of intangible
assets might warrant revisions or that the remaining balance of intangibles
or other long-lived assets may not be recoverable. To make this evaluation,
management compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the
remaining life of the intangibles or other long-lived assets to the carrying
amount of the assets being evaluated. If the expected future cash flows do
not exceed the carrying amount of the assets being evaluated, an impairment
loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the impaired
assets over their fair value. No impairments were recorded in 1999 and 2000.
See Note 6 - 1998 Dispositions and Other Charges for 1998 impairments. The
goodwill associated with a majority of our acquisitions is not deductible for
income tax purposes.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognized when the services are rendered, or products are
delivered to our customers. Unearned revenue represents certain services which
are billed in advance.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method
pursuant to SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred taxes are
recognized for tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted
statutory tax rates applicable in future years to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and
liabilities.
NET INCOME PER SHARE
Net income per common share has been computed in accordance with SFAS
No. 128, Earnings Per Share, which requires the disclosure of basic and
diluted net income per share. Basic net income per share has been computed by
dividing income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for
the period. Diluted net income per share has been computed by dividing income
by the weighted average number of common shares and common stock equivalents
outstanding for the period.
USE OF ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles GAAP requires our management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.
CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes
to consolidated financial statements include the accounts of F.Y.I.
Incorporated and our subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.                    29 PRO FORMA NET INCOME UNAUDITED
We acquired the Pooled Companies in transactions that were accounted
for as poolings-of-interests. The Pooled Companies were managed through their
acquisition dates as independent private companies and represent a variety of
tax structures. The unaudited pro forma data presents the incremental provision
for income taxes as if all entities had been subject to federal and state
income taxes.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes
receivable, net, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair
value due to the short maturities of these instruments. The carrying amount of
long-term debt approximates fair value due to interest rates that approximate
current market rates for instruments of similar size and duration.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This
statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivatives embedded in other contracts
collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities. This
statement, for the Company, is effective January 1, 2001. The Company does not
believe that the adoption of this pronouncement will have a significant impact
on the Company financial statements.
The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, in December
1999. This bulletin, for the Company, was effective with the fourth quarter of
2000. This SAB summarizes the SEC staff views in applying generally accepted
accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. The
Company revenue recognition policies are consistent with SAB 101.

used in calculating the consideration paid for the Purchased Companies was
$2544 per share, which represents a 18% discount from the                    31 average trading price of the common stock based on the length and type of
restrictions in the purchase agreements.
The estimated fair market values reflected above are based on
preliminary estimates and assumptions and are subject to revision. In
management opinion, the preliminary allocations are not expected to be
materially different from the final allocations. Certain of the acquisitions
are subject to adjustments in their overall consideration based upon
performance against specified earning targets over one to three year periods.
1999 ACQUISITIONS
During 1999, we acquired 12 document management businesses, all of
which were accounted for as purchases. These acquisitions were Northern
Minnesota Medical Records Services, Inc., PMI Imaging Systems, Inc., Quality
Data Conversions, Inc., MSI Imaging Solutions, Inc., Information Management
Services, Inc., Managed Care Professionals, Inc., American Economics Group,
Inc., Data Entry and Informational Services, Inc., Rust Consulting, Inc.,
Newport Beach Data Entry, Inc., Copy Right, Inc. and Exigent Computer Group,
Inc. the 1999 Acquisitions. The aggregate consideration paid for the
acquisitions consisted of $668 million in cash and 255,626 shares of common
stock. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is set forth below in
thousands

based on the length and type of restrictions in the purchase agreements.
Certain of the acquisitions are subject to adjustments in their
overall consideration based upon performance against specified earning targets
over one to three year periods.
1998 ACQUISITIONS
During 1998, we acquired 13 document management businesses, eight of
which were accounted for as purchases the Purchased Companies and five of
which were accounted for under the pooling-of-interests method. The eight
acquisitions accounted for as purchases were Medicopy, Inc. Medicopy,
Associate Record Technician Services, Inc. ARTS, DeBari Associates, Inc.
DeBari, ACT Medical Record Services, Inc. ACT, Eagle Legal Services,
Inc. Eagle, Doctex, Inc. Doctex, Copyright, Inc. Copyright, and
certain assets of Olicon Imaging Systems, Inc. Radiology. The aggregate
consideration paid for the Purchased Companies consisted of $182 million in
cash and 644,762 shares of common stock. The preliminary allocation of the
purchase price is set forth below in thousands

Estimated Fair Value of Tangible   7,925
Estimated Fair Value of   8,754
33,684     The weighted average fair market values of the shares of common stock
used in calculating the consideration paid was $2028 per share which
represented a 20% discount from the average trading price of the common stock
based on the length and type of restrictions in the purchase agreements.
Certain of the acquisitions are subject to additional consideration
based upon achievement of specified earning targets over a one to three year
period.
The acquisitions of CMI in September 1998 and ERS in October 1998 for
745,000 and 835,000 shares of common stock, respectively, were accounted for as
poolings-of-interests. The consolidated financial statements for all periods
presented have been restated to include the accounts of CMI and ERS. Pro forma
net income reflects                    32 adjustments for the incremental provision for income taxes as if all entities
had been subject to federal and state income taxes.
The acquisition of Lifo in February 1998 for 326,659 shares of common
stock was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. The acquisitions of TCH and
ADG in December 1998 for 416,524 shares of common stock were also accounted for
as poolings-of-interests. Our consolidated financial statements were not
restated for periods prior to October 1, 1998, due to the financial
immateriality of TCH and ADG.
1998 DISPOSITIONS AND OTHER CHARGES
In October 1998, we entered into an agreement to exchange certain
assets and related liabilities of Leonard Archives Acquisition Corp.
Leonard for cash and certain assets and related liabilities of Copyright,
Inc., a Philadelphia-based provider of healthcare release of information
services. The divestiture of Leonard, which primarily offered archival records
storage, was consistent with our strategic objective of focusing our activities
on higher value-added document and information management and outsourcing
solutions. The book value of the net assets disposed was approximately $41
million, and we recorded a gain of $44 million on the transaction, net of
costs associated with the transaction.
Also in the fourth quarter, we recorded the write-down of certain
intangible and fixed assets and recorded severance and other costs. The
goodwill impairments related to the Computer Central Corporation, Microfilm
Associates, Ltd. and Octo, Inc. acquisitions and a customer list associated
with a Founding Company acquisition in which the customer base associated with
the intangible asset had deteriorated to the extent that the assets were
considered impaired under SFAS 121. The severance represented payments due on
acquisition-related employment contracts terminated or not renewed. The charges
totaling $43 million are presented in the consolidated statement of operations
as follows: i acceleration of goodwill amortization, $18 million; ii
accrual for severance and other costs, $17 million; iii facilities closings
costs, $05 million; and iv other write-downs and impairments, $03 million.
The gain on sale of the assets of Leonard, net of the above charges, was
$145,000 before taxes.
CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION
Certain of our acquisitions are subject to adjustments in their
overall consideration based upon the achievement of specified earning targets
over one to three year periods. During 2000, we paid consideration of $308
million in cash and 662,447 of common stock at an average price of $3209 per
share in relation to contingent consideration agreements that have been
settled. Based upon the evaluation of cumulative earnings through December 31,
2000, against the specified earnings targets, we have accrued aggregate
contingent consideration of approximately $186 million, of which $104 million
is classified as accounts payable and accrued liabilities and will be settled
in cash and $82 million is classified as other long-term obligations and will
be settled in common stock. All of the periods applicable for the earnout
targets have not been completed, and additional amounts may be payable in
future periods under the terms of the agreements.

In February 1998, we entered into a credit agreement the 1998 Credit
Agreement with Paribas and Bank of America Texas, N.A., as co-agents and
lenders named therein. Under the 1998 Credit Agreement, we and our subsidiaries
could borrow on a revolving credit basis loans in an aggregate outstanding
principal amount up to $650 million, subject to certain customary borrowing
capacity requirements. In April 1999 and August 1999, the 1998 Credit Agreement
was amended to increase the aggregate outstanding principal limit to $1000
million and $1250 million, respectively. In November 1999, we further amended
the 1998 Credit Agreement, increasing the aggregate principal limit to $1500
million. In May 2000, the 1998 Credit Agreement was further amended to increase
the aggregate principal limit to $175 million from $150 million. In July 2000,
the 1998 Credit Agreement was amended to extend its revolving term by one year.
The 1998 Credit Agreement is secured by the assets and/or stock of our Company
and our subsidiaries. The availability under the 1998 Credit Agreement as of
December 31, 2000, was $417 million.
The commitment to fund revolving credit loans under the 1998 Credit
Agreement expires February 18, 2002. The annual interest rate applicable to
borrowings under this facility is, at our option, i the prime rate or ii
grid pricing ranging from 05% to 150% plus the Eurodollar rate based on the
ratio of debt to EBITDA as defined                    34 in the 1998 Credit Agreement. The 1998 Credit Agreement requires mandatory
prepayments in certain circumstances. The outstanding principal balance of
revolving credit loans is due and payable on March 31, 2003.
We also have outstanding an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount
of approximately $23 million to serve as guarantee for periodic principal and
interest payments related to the Industrial Revenue Bonds. In January 1998, we
entered into a letter of credit in the amount of $100 million to serve as a
guarantee for performance under a contract with New York State Workers
Compensation Board. In April 1999, the amount of the letter of credit was
reduced to $50 million. Additionally, in November 1999, we entered into a
letter of credit in the amount of $50 million to serve as a guarantee for
performance under a contract with the New York State Teachers' Retirement
System.
The weighted average interest rate on long-term obligations at
December 31, 1999 and 2000, was 64% and 76%, respectively. The 1998 Credit
Agreement contains certain reporting requirements and financial covenants,
including requirements that we maintain minimum levels of net worth and other
financial ratios. As of December 31, 2000, we are in compliance with all loan
covenants.
In December 2000, in order to mitigate interest rate risk, the Company has
entered into an interest rate hedge agreement in the notional amount of $50
million, whereby the Company has fixed the interest rate through March 2003
on the notional amount of the hedge agreement at 5775% plus the applicable
floating spread.

36 10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS     At December 31, 2000, we had one stock-based compensation plan, the
1995 Stock Option Plan, as amended the Plan, which is described below. We
have also issued warrants the Warrants to certain key employees and
employees of our subsidiaries. We refer to these options and warrants
collectively as Awards. We apply APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations
in accounting for awards. Awards are granted at the market price of the common
stock on the date of grant. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been
recognized for the awards. Had compensation cost been determined based upon the
fair value at grant dates for these awards consistent with the method of SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, our net income and earnings
per share would have been as follows in thousands, except for per share data                                 DECEMBER 31,

Actual diluted net income per common share..  $   139  $   160  $   200     The fair value of the Awards was estimated on the date of the grant
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for
1998: risk free interest rate ranging from 40% to 57%, no dividend yield,
average expected life of three years, and volatility of 40%. The following
assumptions were used for 1999: risk free interest rate ranging from 45% to
61%, no dividend yield, average expected life of three years, and volatility
of 35%. The following assumptions were used for 2000: risk free interest rate
ranging from 50% to 68%, no dividend yield, average expected life of three
years, and volatility of 40%.
The Plan provides awards of options to purchase common stock and may
include incentive stock options ISOs and/or non-qualified stock options.
The Plan also provides for automatic option grants to directors who are not
otherwise employed by us or our subsidiaries. Upon commencement of service
or upon agreeing to serve in the case of the initial non-employee
directors, a non-employee director will receive a non-qualified option to
purchase 10,000 shares of common stock, and continuing non-employee directors
will receive annual options to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock. Options
granted to non-employee directors become exercisable one-third on the date of
grant and one-third on each of the next two anniversaries of the date of
grant. Non-employee directors' options have a term of five years from the
date of grant.
The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be subject to
outstanding options under the Plan, determined immediately after the grant of
any option, is the greater of 650,000 shares or 16% of the aggregate number of
shares of our common stock outstanding; provided, however, that options to
purchase no more than 650,000 shares of common stock may be granted as ISOs. At
December 31, 1999 and 2000, approximately 417,000 and 1,046,000 shares,
respectively, were available for issuance.                    37     We had 2,830,410 and 2,598,861 Awards outstanding at December 31,
1999, and 2000, respectively. These Awards, other than those granted to
employee directors, have 10-year expirations and various vesting schedules.                                        AWARDS OUTSTANDING

At December 31, 2000, approximately 88,000 anti-dilutive options were
not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. These options may be
dilutive in future earnings per share calculations.                    38 11. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS     We established a defined contribution plan the 401k plan in
January 1997. The 401k plan covers our employees and the employees of some of
our subsidiaries. The employees must be at least 21 years of age and work at
least 1,000 hours per year with one year of service to be eligible for the
plan. In addition, we established a non-qualified plan in December 1996. The
non-qualified compensation plan permits eligible officers and certain highly
compensated employees to defer a portion of their compensation. Contributions
to both the 401k plan and the non-qualified compensation plan consist of
employee pre-tax contributions determined as a percentage of each participating
employee compensation. We may make contributions to either or both plans at
the discretion of our Board of Directors. We have not made any contributions to
the 401k plan or the deferred compensation plan. We offer no post-employment
or post-retirement benefits.
Certain of the operating companies have separate qualified defined
contribution employee benefit plans the Plans, the majority of which allow
for voluntary pre-tax contributions by employees. The subsidiaries pay all
general and administrative expenses of the Plans and, in some cases, the
subsidiaries make matching and discretionary contributions to the Plans. The
subsidiaries offer no post-employment or post-retirement benefits. The expense
incurred by us related to the Plans was approximately $610,000, $887,000, and
$970,542 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 respectively.
12. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS LEASING TRANSACTIONS
Certain of our operating companies lease their operating facilities,
along with certain equipment, from selling parties who remained our employees
or directors. These leases are for various lengths and annual amounts. The
rental expense for these operating leases for the years ended December 31,
1998, 1999 and 2000 was approximately $647,000, $1,362,348 and $1,113,209,
respectively.
NOTES RECEIVABLE
In the acquisition of the Founding Companies, we acquired $642,000 of
notes receivable from two Founding Company shareholders. When we began our
operations, the shareholders entered into new notes receivable with a stated
interest rate 5% and principal payment schedules. Principal and interest were
paid in full by the shareholders in 1999 and early 2000.
13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES LITIGATION
We are, from time to time, a party to litigation arising in the normal
course of business. Our management believes that none of these actions will
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results
of operations.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of
credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade
receivables. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and certain other
financial instruments at various major financial institutions across many
geographic areas. Credit risk on trade receivables is minimized as a result of
the large number of entities comprising our client base and their dispersion
across many industries and geographic areas.                    39 14. SEGMENT REPORTING     We and our subsidiaries are principally engaged in business process
outsourcing services. We have identified segments based on management
responsibility as follows     F.Y.I. Image: i electronic imaging services, involving the
conversion of paper or microfilm documents into digitized information, database
management and indexing; ii analog services involving the conversion of paper
documents into microfilm images, film processing and computer based indexing
