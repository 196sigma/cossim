ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT Core Materials Corporation
Columbus, Ohio
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Core Materials Corporation
the Company as of December 31, 1996 and 1995 and as of October 31, 1995 and
the related statements of revenues, direct expenses and identified corporate
expenses before interest and taxes for the year ended December 31, 1996, the
two month period ended December 31, 1995 and each of the two years in the period
ended October 31, 1995. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As explained in Note 2, the Company historical operating results are not
necessarily indicative of those which may have resulted had it been a stand
alone company.
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Core Materials Corporation as of December
31, 1996 and 1995 and as of October 31, 1995 and the results of its direct
operations and identified corporate expenses before interest and taxes for the
year ended December 31, 1996, the two month period ended December 31, 1995 and
each of the two years in the period ended October 31, 1995 in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP

25 CORE MATERIALS CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
-  1.  BUSINESS FORMATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Core Materials Corporation Core Materials, a Delaware corporation, was
formed on October 8, 1996 by RYMAC Mortgage Investment Company RYMAC,
a Maryland corporation, as a wholly owned subsidiary, for the purpose of
acquiring substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Columbus
Plastics Operation Columbus Plastics, an operating unit of Navistar
International Transportation Corp. Navistar. Throughout these Notes to
Financial Statements, references to Columbus Plastics refers to the
operations of Core Materials prior to the acquisition.
Prior to 1994, RYMAC was primarily engaged in making investments in
mortgage derivative securities and, to a lesser extent, mortgage related
investments. In mid-1994, RYMAC Board of Directors decided not to pursue
its historical line of business and would investigate alternative
opportunities to maximize stockholder value, which led to the acquisition
of Columbus Plastics.
On December 31, 1996, RYMAC merged into its wholly owned subsidiary, Core
Materials, by converting each outstanding common share of RYMAC into the
right to receive one common share of Core Materials, with Core Materials
as the surviving corporation and continuing registrant. Simultaneously, on
December 31, 1996, Core Materials purchased substantially all of the
assets and assumed certain liabilities of Columbus Plastics for 1
$29,514,000, in the form of a secured promissory note due to Navistar
Secured Note and 2 4,264,000 shares of Core Materials common stock,
representing approximately 45% of the total number of shares of Core
Materials common stock then issued and outstanding see Note 4 the
Acquisition.
Based upon the terms of the Acquisition, the transaction for financial
reporting and accounting purposes has been accounted for as a reverse
acquisition whereby Columbus Plastics is deemed to have acquired Core
Materials. However, Core Materials is the continuing legal entity and
registrant for both Securities and Exchange Commission filing purposes and
income tax reporting purposes. Consistent with reverse acquisition
accounting treatment Core Materials has carried forward the historical
basis of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Columbus Plastics
and has revalued the basis of its net assets to fair value at December 31,
1996.
Core Materials produces compression Sheet Molding Composite SMC
fiberglass reinforced parts. Core Materials has two principal customers,
Navistar and Yamaha, and provides Navistar truck assembly operations
with generally all of its SMC requirements, primarily hoods and air
deflector shields.                    -23-

2.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The fiscal year end of Core Materials Corporation is December 31. Columbus
Plastics' historical year end was October 31. In the accompanying
financial statements, the historical fiscal year of Columbus Plastics has
been maintained through October 31, 1995, its previous most recently
audited financial statements. Effective December 31, 1995, the fiscal year
end was changed to conform to the year end of Core Materials, the
continuing legal entity and registrant.
The accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 1996 reflects the
Acquisition accounted for as a reverse acquisition. All other accompanying
financial statements reflect the historical assets, liabilities and
operations of Columbus Plastics. Note 5 contains the unaudited pro forma
combined statements of income of Core Materials for the twelve months
ended December 31, 1996 and the twelve months ended October 31, 1995, as
if the Acquisition had been consummated as of November 1, 1994.
Prior to the Acquisition, Columbus Plastics was not a stand alone
division or subsidiary of Navistar and was not generally accounted for
separately. As a result, the distinct and separate accounts necessary to
present individual Core Materials balance sheets as of December 31, 1995 
and October 31, 1995 and income statements for the year ended December 
31, 1996, the two month period ended December 31, 1995 and each of the 
two years in the period ended October 31, 1995 have not been maintained.
Columbus Plastics did not maintain corporate treasury, legal, tax,
purchasing and other similar corporate support functions. Corporate
general and administrative expenses have not been previously allocated to
Columbus Plastics. For purposes of preparing the Core Materials financial
statements, certain of these corporate costs, along with other Navistar
Truck Group expenses, were allocated using an allocation method see Note
14. However, Navistar systems and procedures do not provide sufficient
information to develop a reasonable cost allocation for income taxes,
corporate debt and interest expense.
With respect to cash flows; purchases of inventory, payroll, capital and
other expenditures were funded through the Equity Investment account with 
Navistar. Accounts payable to third party vendors and certain expense 
accruals were processed and recorded at other Navistar locations.
Remittances from sales to third parties were collected by Navistar and
were accounted for through the Equity Investment account as were sales to
Navistar truck assembly operations. Accordingly, Columbus Plastics has
no operating cash flows.
FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION - Based upon the above information, the
following financial information is presented    -   Balance Sheets - The assets and liabilities of Columbus Plastics
are included herein at Navistar historical cost. The net assets 
of Core Materials have been revalued to their fair value at 
December 31, 1996.
-24-
27
-   Statements of Revenues, Direct Expenses and Identified Corporate
Expenses before Interest and Taxes-Includes all Navistar corporate
cost allocations for which a reasonable method of allocating the
costs to the operations of Columbus Plastics can be developed.
-   Statements of Cash Flows are not presented as Columbus Plastics has
essentially no cash flow. Note 8 to the financial statements
presents a reconciliation of the Navistar Equity Investment account
for all periods presented.
3.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
REVENUE RECOGNITION - During the periods presented, Core Materials 
recorded sales to Navistar manufacturing plants at its standard cost 
at date of shipment. Effective December 31, 1996, sales to Navistar will 
be recorded at the prices stipulated in the Comprehensive Supply 
Agreement between Core Materials and Navistar the Supply Agreement 
see Note 15, which approximate fair value. Sales to third party 
customers, other than Navistar, are recorded at negotiated prices at 
date of shipment.
MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITY - Pursuant to reverse acquisition accounting, the
mortgage-backed security is recorded at its fair value at December 31,
1996, which is also the cost basis to Core Materials. The security, which
matures in November 2025, is considered held to maturity, and is carried
at the lower of its cost or market value. Core Materials has the intent
and ability to hold this security to maturity.
INVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost standard cost
or market.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - Property, plant and equipment are recorded
at cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. The carrying amount of long-lived
assets is evaluated annually to determine if adjustment to the
depreciation period or to the unamortized balance is warranted. Such
evaluation is based principally on the expected utilization of the
long-lived assets.
Ranges of estimated useful lives for computing depreciation are as
follows     Land improvements                20 years
Building and improvements           20-50 years
Machinery and equipment            3-25 years
Tools, dies and patterns            3-5 years
-25-
28    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - Core Materials' financial
instruments consist of a mortgage-backed security investment, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and a secured note payable. The carrying
amounts of the financial instruments approximate their fair value.
EARNINGS PER SHARE - Earnings per share is not presented as Columbus
Plastics was not a stand alone division or subsidiary of Navistar and was
generally not accounted for separately during the periods presented.
4.  ACQUISITION
On December 31, 1996 Core Materials acquired substantially all of the
assets and assumed certain liabilities of Columbus Plastics for 1 a
$25,504,000 Secured Note due Navistar, subject to adjustment, and 2
4,264,000 shares of Core Materials common stock, representing
approximately 45% of the total number of shares of Core Materials common
stock then issued and outstanding.
Effective December 31, 1996, the Secured Note was increased to
$29,514,000 in order to reflect an increase in the net tangible assets
as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement between RYMAC and Navistar
the Agreement of Columbus Plastics as of December 31, 1996.
In connection with the Acquisition, Core Materials is required to pay
Navistar future consideration in the form of an increase in the Secured
Note based upon a multiple of the amount by which Core Materials' earnings
before interest and taxes EBIT exceeds established thresholds over the
three year period 1997 to 1999. The future consideration received will be
based upon a multiple of EBIT as follows     -  1997: If EBIT exceeds $6,512,000, then the future
consideration will be the excess multiplied by 555.
-  1998: If EBIT exceeds $6,512,000, then the future
consideration will be the product of the 1998 excess EBIT less
the 1997 excess EBIT multiplied by 450.
-  1999: If EBIT exceeds $6,512,000, then the future
consideration will be the product of the 1999 excess EBIT less
the 1998 excess EBIT multiplied by 275.
The maximum increase in the Secured Note as a result of future
consideration is limited to $24,496,000. Such increases will be accounted 
for by reducing Core Materials' retained earnings and will increase the 
amount of the balloon payment due in November 2006.
Based upon the terms of the Acquisition, the transaction for financial
reporting and accounting purposes has been accounted for as a reverse
acquisition whereby Columbus Plastics is deemed to have acquired Core
Materials. However, Core Materials is the continuing legal entity and
registrant for both Securities and Exchange Commission filing purposes and
income tax reporting purposes. Consistent with reverse acquisition
accounting                    -26-
29    treatment Core Materials has carried forward the historical basis of the
acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Columbus Plastics and has
revalued the basis of its net assets to fair value at December 31, 1996.
Consistent with reverse acquisition accounting treatment, the purchase
price should be determined as the fair value of the consideration paid or
received whichever is more clearly evident. Because RYMAC stock was
thinly traded and supported a company with no operations prior to the
Acquisition, the fair value of RYMAC then outstanding common stock was
not appropriate to determine the Acquisition purchase price. Instead the
purchase price was determined based upon the fair value of the
consideration received Core Materials' assets and liabilities by
Columbus Plastics. The purchase price was approximately $160 million,
calculated as follows, and excludes any future consideration which would
be paid if certain earnings thresholds are met                              
Cash                $  584,351
Mortgage-backed security       3,295,049
Other assets              122,935
Deferred tax asset, net       12,455,000
Accrued expenses            492,649
$15,964,686    Transaction costs incurred by the acquiror in connection with the
acquisition of a company without operating substance should be treated
similar to that of an offering of equity securities as a reduction of
paid-in capital. Since the recording of Navistar transaction costs at
Core Materials would result in no net impact to Core Materials' balance
sheet, Navistar transaction costs are excluded from the purchase price.
The Agreement identified the specific assets to be acquired and the
specific liabilities to be assumed. The decrease in accounts payable at
December 31, 1996 versus the prior periods as shown in the accompanying
balance sheets reflects the retention by Navistar of certain accounts
payable at closing in accordance with the Agreement.
5.  PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION UNAUDITED
The following unaudited pro forma combined statements of income for the
twelve month periods ended December 31, 1996 and October 31, 1995 are

December 31, 1996 and October 31, 1995 have been prepared assuming the proposed
acquisition had occurred on November 1, 1994 and reflect the effects of certain
adjustments to the historical financial statements that result from the
acquisition of Columbus Plastics by Core Materials. Columbus Plastics was not a
stand alone division or subsidiary of Navistar and was not generally accounted
for separately. Navistar systems and procedures do not provide sufficient
information to develop a reasonable cost allocation for income taxes and
interest expense. Accordingly, historical net income per common share amounts 
have not been included for the                     -29-
32 financial information for Columbus Plastics. A historical statement of income 
for Core Materials is not included in the unaudited proforma combined financial 
information as the Acquisition was accounted for using reverse acquisition 
accounting treatment.
a   Represents the estimated interest income to be earned on the
mortgage-backed security at the security effective interest rate of
7%.
b   Represents the additional revenues resulting from pricing sales by Core
Materials to Navistar reflecting the prices specified in the
Comprehensive Supply Agreement, rather than at Core Materials
historical standard cost.
c   Represents the estimated interest expense on the Secured Note due to
Navistar at 8% per annum less the interest credit of $520,000 and
$150,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1996 and October 31,
1995, respectively, which represents the capitalization of interest on 
the Secured Note relating to property, plant and equipment under
construction.
d   Represents an estimate of the additional administrative expenses to be
incurred by Core Materials as a result of its status as a stand-alone,
publicly owned company rather than an operating unit of a much larger
corporation. Additional costs consist primarily of executive salary
costs and legal and directors fees. The historical marketing and
administrative expense of Columbus Plastics includes allocated
corporate costs which are reflective of the costs that will be charged
to Columbus Plastics pursuant to the Transitional Services Agreement
between Core Materials and Navistar. Accordingly, no adjustments have
been recorded to reflect the impact of the Transitional Services
Agreement on the unaudited proforma combined financial statements.
e   The weighted average number of common shares and common stock 
equivalents outstanding used to calculate net income per common share
include the number of shares of Core Materials common stock outstanding
prior to the acquisition; the number of shares issued to Navistar as
consideration for the Acquisition; and the effect of the exercise of
260,000 dilutive Core Materials stock options, using the treasury stock
method.
f   Represents the estimated income tax expense for Core Materials based
upon a statutory Federal tax rate of 34% and an estimated Ohio state
and local tax rate of 11%. The income tax expense recorded in the
unaudited proforma combined financial statements is not necessarily 
indicative of the cash payments for income taxes that Core Materials 
would be required to pay due to Core Materials' substantial net 
operating loss carryforwards. Core Materials expects to only be 
required to make minimal Federal income tax payments as mandated, 
primarily, by the Alternative Minimum Tax regulations until such time 
that the loss carryforwards are fully utilized or expired. 6.  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment consists of the following                    -30-

Construction in progress primarily relates to the purchase and
installation of SMC presses and certain other SMC capital projects.
Substantially all amounts included in construction in progress at December
31, 1996, December 31, 1995 and October 31, 1995 are expected to be placed
in service within six months from each respective period end. At December
31, 1995 and October 31, 1995 commitments for capital expenditures in 
progress, relating to SMC presses, were approximately $2,600,000 and 
$1,800,000, respectively. There were no commitments for capital
expenditures in progress at December 31, 1996. Prior to December 31, 
1996, Core Materials did not record capitalized interest on construction 
in progress as interest expense was not allocated by Navistar to Columbus 
Plastics.
7.  DEBT
Secured Note
The Secured Note due to Navistar of $29,514,000 at December 31, 1996 bears
interest at the rate of 8% per annum, payable semi-annually, and is
secured by a first priority lien upon and security interest in all of Core
Materials' assets. The Secured Note is due in November 2006. In connection
with the acquisition, Core Materials is also required to pay Navistar
future consideration in the form of an increase in the principal amount of
the Secured Note if Core Materials achieves earnings before interest and
taxes in excess of established thresholds during the period 1997 through
1999. See Note 4.    Principal payments under the Secured Note are due as follows    a. Within ninety 90 days after the end of each fiscal year of Core
Materials during the term of the Secured Note, Core Materials shall pay
principal in an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the total
cash and cash equivalents of Core Materials, as shown on Core Materials'
audited balance sheet as of the end of such fiscal year, exceeds
$3,000,000; and
-31-
34
b. In the event Core Materials obtains, from time to time, any
refinancing loan as defined by the terms of the Secured Note, Core
Materials shall promptly upon obtaining such loan pay principal in an
amount equal to the proceeds of such loan.
Based upon the financial position of Core Materials at December 31, 1996,
the Secured Note is classified as long-term on the balance sheet.
The provisions of the Secured Note prohibit the declaration or payment of
cash dividends, the repurchase or retirement of capital stock, as well as
the pledge of any of Core Materials' assets or revenue as a security 
lien to a third party as long as the Secured Note is outstanding.
Line of Credit
Subsequent to December 31, 1996, Core Materials entered into a line of
credit facility with a Bank $3,000,000 maximum availability for working
capital purposes. The line of credit is repayable on demand, bears
interest at the prime rate 825% at December 31, 1996 and is secured
by the mortgage-backed security.
8.  EQUITY INVESTMENT ACCOUNT
Cash flows for purchases and sales of inventory, payroll, capital
expenditures, and other expenditures were funded through the intercompany
equity investment account with Navistar. The following summarizes the
changes in the Equity Investment account for the periods presented                                TWO

treatment requires that the retained earnings carried forward to Core
Materials as of December 31, should consist of Columbus Plastics'
Equity Investment account, less an amount equivalent to the par value of
Core Materials common stock owned by Navistar. This item represents the
transfer of the Equity Investment account to common stock and retained
earnings.
9.  EQUITY
Anti-takeover Measures
Core Materials' Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws contain certain
provisions designed to discourage specific types of transactions involving
an actual or threatened change of control of Core Materials. These
provisions, which are designed to make it more difficult to change
majority control of the Board of Directors without its consent, include
the following        Removal of Directors - This provision provides that a director of
Core Materials may be removed with or without cause only upon the
vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of the
outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally in
the election of directors.
Supermajority Approval - This provision requires that a merger
and certain other transactions as outlined in the Certificate of
Incorporation be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders
of at least 66 2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Core
Materials' common stock. Such affirmative vote is required
notwithstanding the fact that no vote may be required, or that
a lesser percentage may be specified by law.                    -33-
36        Amendments - This provision requires that any amendment to the
provisions relating to the removal of directors be approved by
the holders of at least 80% of the then outstanding shares of
voting stock, and any amendment to provisions requiring the
approval of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the then
outstanding shares of voting stock be approved by the holders of
at least 66 2/3% of the then outstanding shares of voting stock.    Restrictions on Transfer
Core Materials' Certificate of Incorporation also contains a provision 
the Prohibited Transfer Provision designed to help assure the 
continued availability of Core Materials' substantial net operating loss
and capital loss carryforwards by seeking to prevent an ownership
change as defined under current Treasury Department income tax
regulations. Under the Prohibited Transfer Provision, if a stockholder
transfers or agrees to transfer stock, the transfer will be prohibited
and void to the extent that it would cause the transferee to hold a
Prohibited Ownership Percentage as defined in Core Materials'
Certificate of Incorporation, but generally, means direct and indirect
ownership of 45% or more of the Company common stock or if the
transfer would result in the transferee ownership increasing if the
transferee had held a Prohibited Ownership Percentage within the three
prior years or if the transferee ownership percentage already exceeds
the Prohibited Ownership Percentage under applicable Federal income tax
rules. The Prohibited Transfer Provision does not prevent transfers of
stock between persons who do not hold a Prohibited Ownership Percentage.
Restricted Common Stock
On February 19, 1997, Core Materials issued, in total, 40,200 shares of
common stock, par value $001 per share, to approximately 402 employees 
which constituted all of its employees with the exception of certain 
executive employees. The Company received no consideration for the 
shares. The shares were issued as an incentive for its employees to remain
with the Company and are subject to forfeiture to the Company if an
employee leaves prior to December 31, 1998. During this period, the shares
may not be transferred.
Preferred Stock
The Company has authorized 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock par
value: $001 of which none is issued.
-34-
37 10.  STOCK OPTIONS AND EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN
At the time of the merger of RYMAC into Core Materials, each outstanding
option to purchase shares of RYMAC common stock granted under any of
RYMAC previous stock option plans was deemed amended to constitute an
option to acquire, at the same price per share, the same number of shares
of Core Materials' common stock.
At December 31, 1996, there were 260,000 outstanding options each to
purchase one share of Core Materials' common stock at prices ranging from
$075 to $150, all of which were exercisable. All of the options are held
by executive officers and a former director of RYMAC. There have been no
options granted during the year ended December 31, 1996, the two month
period ended December 31, 1995 or the year ended October 31, 1995;
accordingly, pro forma disclosures as required by Statement of Accounting
Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation are not
applicable.    Subsequent to year-end, the Board of Directors of Core Materials
authorized the adoption of the Core Materials Corporation -- Long Term 
Equity Incentive Plan, subject to the approval of holders of a majority
of the Core Materials' common shares outstanding. The plan allows for 
grant of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, director 
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares,
performance units and other incentive awards up to an aggregate 15 
million awards, each award representing a right to buy a share of Core 
Materials' common stock. The plan expires on the earlier of December 31,
2006, or the date that the maximum number of available awards under the
plan have been granted.
11.  LEASES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES
Core Materials has long-term noncancellable leases for use of equipment
under operating lease agreements. Total rental expense under such
agreements amounted to approximately $563,000 for the year ended December
31, 1996, $83,000 for the two month period ended December 31, 1995 and
$560,000 and $540,000 for the years ended October 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.
At December 31, 1996, the aggregate minimum future rental commitments
under noncancellable leases with terms in excess of one year were
approximately $569,000 in 1997; $569,000 in 1998; $273,000 in 1999;
$174,000 in 2000 and $15,000 in 2001.
Accrued expenses at December 31, 1996, December 31, 1995 and October 31, 
1995 include $1,174,770, $1,101,456, and $819,522, respectively, for 
certain accrued employee benefits. 12.  INCOME TAXES
As Navistar systems and procedures do not provide sufficient information
to develop a reasonable cost allocation for income taxes, income taxes
were not allocated to Columbus Plastics prior to the Acquisition.
Accordingly, there is no income tax expense recorded in the accompanying
financial statements.
The accompanying financial statements include a deferred tax asset for
Core Materials' net operating loss NOL and capital loss carryforwards
and the temporary difference between the book and tax basis of Core
Materials' property, plant and equipment. The components of the deferred
tax asset at December 31, 1996 are as follows                    -35-
38                           
Property, plant and equipment    $ 5,036,000
Net operating loss carryforwards    10,925,000
Capital loss carryforwards       3,332,000
$ 19,293,000
Valuation allowance          6,838,000
Deferred Tax Asset-Net        $ 12,455,000
A valuation allowance has been provided for those NOL carryforwards and
temporary differences which are estimated to expire before they are
utilized. A full allowance has been provided against the approximately
$98 million of capital loss carryforwards, because the capital loss
carryforwards are estimated to expire before they are utilized
$4,800,000 expire in 1999 and $5,000,000 expire in 2001. At December 31,
1996, Core Materials had approximately $321 million of NOL carryforwards
available to offset future taxable income. Such carryforwards reflect
income tax losses incurred which will expire as follows                  
2007:  $16,656,000
2008:   10,823,000
2009:   3,614,000
2010:    638,000
2011:    400,000 13.  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
Core Materials provides postretirement benefits to substantially all of
its employees. Total postretirement benefits expense includes the pension
expense for salaried employees, retirees and surviving spouses, and
postretirement health care and life insurance expense for all employees,
retirees and surviving spouses and dependents. Core Materials also
participates in a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan for its
union represented employees, and allows all employees to participate in
one of two 401k plans, to which Core Materials does not make
contributions. Prior to the Acquisition Core Materials' employees were
participants in the Navistar sponsored pension and postretirement plans.
Navistar allocated postretirement benefit costs to Columbus Plastics
based upon the number of Columbus Plastics participants and their
respective demographic data.
The pension plan for non-represented employees is non-contributory with
benefits related to an employee length of service and compensation rate.
In connection with the acquisition, Navistar retained responsibility for
vested benefits as of December 31, 1996. Under the principles of reverse
acquisition accounting, the retention of the earned pension liability by
Navistar has been treated as a settlement for that portion of the total
pension obligation. As Navistar did not push down Columbus Plastics'
portion of the total pension liability to their financial statements prior
to the Acquisition, the pension liability as of December 31, 1996 has been
reclassified from the Navistar Equity Investment account. The plan
provisions at December 31, 1996 are substantially the same as the prior
Navistar sponsored defined benefit pension plan for non-represented
employees. The funded status of the non-represented employees' pension
plan as of December 31, 1996 and a reconciliation with the amount                    -36-
39
recognized in the Balance Sheet is as follows                                
Accumulated benefit obligation            $   0
Projected benefit obligation             $400,000
Plan assets at fair value                  0
Funded status at December 31, 1996          400,000
Unrecognized pension costs    Transition obligation                 47,000
Prior service costs                  10,000
Net pension losses                   99,000
Net liability                    $244,000
All Core Materials' union employees are covered under a multi-employer
defined benefit pension plan administered under a collective bargaining
agreement. This plan is not administered by Core Materials and
contributions are determined in accordance with provisions in the
negotiated labor contract. Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase
Agreement see Note 4 Navistar withdrew from the multi-employer plan,
and, simultaneously, Core Materials took over Navistar former
responsibilities in regards to the multi-employer plan. Management has 
been advised by the multi-employer plan actuary that Navistar
withdrawal from the plan will not result in a withdrawal liability.
The postretirement plan provides healthcare and life insurance for retired
employees; spouses and certain dependents and calls for cost sharing
between Core Materials, Navistar and the participants in the form of
premiums, co-payments and deductibles. The plan is substantially the same
as the plans provided by Navistar prior to the Acquisition. Core Materials
and Navistar share the cost of such benefits based upon the hire date and
retirement status of the employee participant using a formula that
allocates the cost based upon the respective portion of time that the
employee was an active service participant after the Acquisition to the
period of active service prior to the Acquisition. Core Materials will be
fully responsible for the postretirement healthcare and life insurance
benefits for all employees hired after January 1, 1997. Since Columbus
Plastics' accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for healthcare and
life insurance benefits as of December 31, 1996 was fully retained by
Navistar no liability for such benefits is recorded as of December 31,
1996 in the accompanying financial statements.
The costs of postretirement benefits including the effect of the corporate
allocation adjustments see Note 14 are segregated as a separate
component in the accompanying Statements of Revenues, Direct Expenses and
Identified Corporate Expenses Before Interest and Taxes and approximate
the following                    -37-

14.  CORPORATE ALLOCATIONS
Prior to its acquisition by Core Materials, Columbus Plastics did not
maintain corporate treasury, legal, tax, purchasing and other similar
corporate support functions. Columbus Plastics did record certain budgeted
corporate expenses related primarily to employee benefits, real estate
taxes and insurance. Adjustments to these amounts to reflect actual
expenditures were not recorded by Columbus Plastics but are included in
the corporate allocation amounts noted below. For purposes of preparing
the financial information for Columbus Plastics certain corporate costs
and credits along with other Navistar Truck Group expenses which were not
budgeted to Columbus Plastics were allocated based upon a variety of
factors which include the size of the Columbus Plastics operation, the
number of Columbus Plastics employees, and the identification of costs
specifically attributable to Columbus Plastics. Management believes that
the allocation method used is reasonable and reflective of Columbus
Plastics' proportionate share of such expenses and is comparable to those
that would have been incurred on a stand-alone basis.
The following summarizes the corporate costs credits allocated to
Columbus Plastics which were not budgeted and recorded by Columbus
Plastics. The amounts represent adjustments to the budgeted expenses or
allocations of Navistar Corporate and Truck Group Marketing and
Administrative expenses.                         TWO MONTHS

41 15.  RELATED PARTIES
In connection with the acquisition, Core Materials and Navistar entered
into a Supply Agreement and a Transitional Services Agreement the
Services Agreement. Under the terms of the Supply Agreement, for a
period of five years commencing December 31, 1996, Navistar agreed to
purchase from Core Materials, and Core Materials agreed to sell to
Navistar at negotiated prices, which approximate fair value, all of
Navistar original equipment and service requirements for Fiberglass
Reinforced Parts using the Sheet Molding Composite process as they
currently exist or as they may be improved or modified. On a pro forma
basis, pursuant to the terms of the Supply Agreement, Core Materials would
have charged Navistar for sales of its products approximately $35,670,000,
$6,210,000, $43,640,000 and $37,600,000 for the year ended December 31,
1996, the two month period ended December 31, 1995, and for the years
ended October 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. However, no minimum
quantities of annual production of products or minimum purchase quantities
are set forth or implied in the Supply Agreement, and no penalties will be
imposed on Navistar for volumes of products actually ordered by Navistar
below those quantities forecasted. Under the terms of the Services
Agreement, Navistar will provide financial reporting, accounting, computer
services, and office support services to Core Materials and procure
insurance on Core Materials' behalf for up to three years at fees based
upon actual hours incurred, the cost of Navistar personnel and related
expenses, and any costs incurred by Navistar in providing such services
and purchases. Management believes that the costs that will be incurred
pursuant to the Services Agreement will approximate the amounts
historically allocated to Columbus Plastics see Note 14.
16.  LABOR CONCENTRATION
At December 31, 1996, Core Materials had 340 manufacturing employees all
of which were represented by the International Association of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers IAM. The collective bargaining agreement with
the IAM expires on August 1, 1998. 17.  QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UNAUDITED
The following is a summary of the unaudited quarterly results of
operations for the years ended December 31, 1996 and October 31, 1995. The
results for the two month period ended December 31, 1995 are not presented
herein as audited results are provided in the accompanying financial
