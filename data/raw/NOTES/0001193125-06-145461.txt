Item8 for detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and base
them on a combination of historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to 
31  
be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our critical accounting policies that require significant judgments
and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows:  Revenue Recognition  Revenue, net of estimated returns and allowances, is recognized upon the shipment of products or upon the completion of services provided to customers, which corresponds to the time when risk of ownership transfers, the selling price is
fixed, the customer is obligated to pay and we have no significant remaining obligations. Cash received in advance from customers is deferred on our balance sheet as a current liability and recognized upon the shipment of products or upon the
completion of services provided to the customers.  Catalog Costs and Related
Amortization  We spend over $400 million annually to
produce and distribute catalogs. We accumulate all direct costs incurred, net of vendor cooperative advertising payments, in the development, production and circulation of our catalogs on our balance sheet until such time as the related catalog is
mailed. They are subsequently amortized into SGA over the expected sales realization cycle, which is one year or less. Consequently, any difference between our estimated and actual revenue stream for a particular catalog and the related impact
on amortization expense is neutralized within a period of one year or less. Our estimate of the expected sales realization cycle for a particular catalog is based on, among other possible considerations, our historical sales experience with
identical or similar catalogs and our assessment of prevailing economic conditions and various competitive factors. We track our subsequent sales realization, reassess the marketplace, and compare our findings to our previous estimate and adjust the
amortization of our future catalogs, if necessary.  Development Costs
We accumulate external and certain internal costs
incurred in the development of our products which can include a master copy of a book, video or other media, on our balance sheet. As of April29, 2006, we had $228 million in net development costs on our balance sheet. A majority of these
costs are associated with our publishing, science and visual media businesses. The capitalized development costs are subsequently amortized into cost of revenues over the expected sales realization cycle of the products, which is typically five
years. During fiscal 2006, we amortized to expense $46 million related to development costs. We continue to monitor the expected sales realization cycle for each product, and will adjust the remaining expected life of the development costs or
recognize an impairment, if warranted. During fiscal 2006 we recorded a $10 million impairment charge related to product development costs at our Visual Media business unit.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets, and Long-Lived Assets  At April29, 2006, goodwill and intangible assets represented approximately 661% of our total assets. Determining the
recoverability of these assets requires considerable judgment and is evaluated on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired.  As it relates to goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, we apply the impairment rules in accordance with SFAS
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As required by SFAS No142, the recoverability of these assets is subject to a fair value assessment which includes judgments regarding financial projections, including forecasted
cash flows and discount rates, and comparable market values. As it relates to finite life intangible assets, we apply the impairment rules as required by SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
which also requires significant judgments related to the expected future cash flows attributable to the intangible asset. The impact of modifying any of these assumptions can have a significant impact on the estimate of fair value and, thus, the
estimated recoverability, or impairment, if any, of the asset. 
32  During fiscal 2006, we recorded a $256 million partial goodwill impairment charge related to our Visual
Media business unit. The impairment was the result of deteriorating financial performance, particularly in the Teachers Media offering. School Specialty Visual Media has remaining goodwill and intangible asset values of $130 million and $111
million, respectively. If the business unit does not perform as expected, it is possible that additional impairments to goodwill and intangible assets could occur.  Item7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk  Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and debt. Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates. Our borrowings under our credit facility and our discount expense related to our accounts receivable
securitization are primarily dependent upon LIBOR rates. Assuming no change in our financial structure, if variable interest rates were to average 100 basis points higher during fiscal 2006, pre-tax earnings would have decreased by approximately
$25 million. This amount was determined by considering a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates on average variable-rate debt outstanding and the average advanced under the accounts receivable securitization facility during fiscal
2006. The estimated fair value of long-term debt approximated its carrying value at April29, 2006, with the exception of our convertible debt which at April29, 2006 had a carrying value of $1330 million and a fair market value of $1362
million.

1ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  School
Specialty, Inc. the Company is an education company, serving the preK-12 market, with leading brands that provide educators with innovative and proprietary products, programs and services designed to help educators engage and inspire
students of all ages and abilities, with operations primarily in the United States and Canada.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements include the accounts of School Specialty, Inc., its subsidiaries and the companies acquired in business
combinations from their respective dates of acquisition. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  NOTE 2SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Definition of Fiscal Year  The Companys
fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in April in each year. As used in these consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements, fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004
refer to the Companys fiscal years ended April29, 2006,April30, 2005 and April24, 2004, respectively. All fiscal years reported represent 52 weeks with the exception of fiscal 2005 which had 53 weeks.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers cash investments with original maturities of three
months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.  Inventories  Inventories, which consist
primarily of products held for sale, are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally determined on a weighted-average basis.  Property, Plant and Equipment  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Additions and improvements are capitalized, whereas maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The estimated useful lives range from twenty-five to forty years for buildings and its components
and three to fifteen years for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Property and equipment leased under sale-leaseback obligations and capital leases are being amortized over the lesser of its useful life or its lease term. 
40  SCHOOL SPECIALTY, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED APRIL 29, 2006, APRIL 30, 2005 AND APRIL 24, 2004 In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for
under the purchase method. Certain intangible assets including a perpetual license agreement and various trademarks and tradenames are estimated to have indefinite lives and are not subject to amortization. Under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization but rather must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if
events or circumstances indicate they might be impaired. The Company performs the annual impairment test during the first quarter of each fiscal year. Amortizable intangible assets include customer relationships, publishing rights, non-compete
agreements, trademarks and tradenames, order backlog and copyrights and are being amortized over their estimated useful lives. During fiscal 2006, the Company recorded a $25,600 goodwill impairment charge related to the Visual Media business unit.
Development Costs  Development costs represent external and internal costs incurred in the
development of a master copy of a book, workbook, video or other supplemental educational materials and products. The Company capitalizes development costs and amortizes these costs into costs of revenues over their estimated useful lives in amounts
proportionate to expected revenues. At April29, 2006 and April30, 2005, net development costs totaled $22,783 and $14,749, respectively, and are included as a component of development costs and other assets in the consolidated balance
sheets.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  As required by SFAS No144 Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Company reviews property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangible assets and development costs for impairment if events or circumstances indicate an asset might be impaired. The Company assesses
impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and records any impairment based on estimated fair value determined using discounted cash flows. The Company recorded a $1,000 impairment charge in fiscal 2006 related to the product development asset at
its Visual Media business unit.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Companys financial
instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, including retained interests in securitized receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value given the short maturity of these instruments. The
estimated fair value of the credit facility approximated its carrying value at April29, 2006 and April30, 2005 given the variable interest rates included with this facility. The Companys convertible debt had a carrying value of
$133,000 and a fair market value of $136,159 at April29, 2006, and a carrying value of $133,000 and a fair market value of $142,643 at April30, 2005, as determined using the closing bid prices as reported on the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc.s Portal Market on April30, 2006 and April29, 2005, respectively. The Companys sale-leaseback obligations had a carrying value of $16,663 and $17,075 and a fair market value of $17,342 and $18,624 at
April29, 2006 and April30, 2005, respectively, as determined using estimated interest rates available at April29, 2006 and April30, 2005 for similar long-term borrowings.  Income Taxes  Income taxes have been computed utilizing the asset and liability approach which requires the recognition of deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted 
41  SCHOOL SPECIALTY, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED APRIL 29, 2006, APRIL 30, 2005 AND APRIL 24, 2004 In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts 
statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and
liabilities. Valuation allowances are provided when it is anticipated that some or all of a deferred tax asset is not likely to be realized.  Revenue Recognition  Revenue, net of estimated returns and allowances, is recognized upon the shipment of products or upon the completion of services provided to customers,
which corresponds to the time when risk of ownership transfers, the selling price is fixed, the customer is obligated to pay and the Company has no significant remaining obligations. Cash received in advance from customers is deferred on the balance
sheet as a current liability and recognized upon the shipment of products or upon the completion of services provided to customers.  Concentration of Credit Risks  The Company grants credit to customers in the ordinary course of business. The majority of the Companys customers are school districts and schools.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the significant number of customers and their geographic dispersion. During fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, no customer represented more than 10% of revenues or accounts
receivable.  Vendor Rebates  Vendor rebates relating to product purchases are recognized as a reduction
in cost of revenues over the estimated period the related products are sold.  Deferred Catalog Costs  Deferred catalog costs
represent costs which have been paid to produce Company catalogs, net of vendor cooperative advertising payments, which will be used in and benefit future periods. Deferred catalog costs are amortized in amounts proportionate to expected revenues
over the life of the catalog, which is one year or less. Amortization expense related to deferred catalog costs is included in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Such
amortization expense for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $44,749, $34,086 and $33,084, respectively.  Restructuring  The
Company accounts for restructuring costs associated with the closure or disposal of distribution centers in accordance with SFAS No146 Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. During fiscal 2006, $4,002 of
expenses related to severance and lease costs was incurred. At April29, 2006, there was $2,329 of accrued restructuring costs recorded in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet primarily related to lease exit costs of the
Southaven, Mississippi distribution center that have no future benefit to the Company.  Shipping and Handling Costs  The Company
accounts for shipping and handling costs billed to customers as a component of revenues. The Company accounts for shipping and handling costs incurred as a cost of revenues for shipments made directly from vendors to customers. For shipments made
from the Companys warehouses, the Company accounts for 
42  SCHOOL SPECIALTY, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED APRIL 29, 2006, APRIL 30, 2005 AND APRIL 24, 2004 In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts 
shipping and handling costs incurred as a selling, general and administrative expense. The amount of shipping and handling costs included in selling, general
and administrative expenses for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $46,726, $42,675 and $40,364, respectively.  Foreign Currency Translation  The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with SFAS No52, Foreign Currency
Translation. All balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Amounts in the statements of operations have been translated using the weighted average exchange rate for the year.
Resulting translation adjustments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income.  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company accounts for its employee stock option plans under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board APB
Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. Under APB Opinion No25, no stock-based compensation is reflected in net income, as all options granted under the plans had a fixed
exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and the related number of shares granted is fixed at that point in time. Had compensation expense related to the Companys stock option grants to
employees and directors been recognized based upon the fair value of the stock options on the grant date under the methodology prescribed by SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, the Companys net income and
net income per share would have been impacted as indicated in the following table:  Fiscal2006 Fiscal2005 Fiscal2004 52 weeks 53 weeks 52 weeks Net income, as reported 61 43,001 40,797 Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax

The fair value of
options granted which is amortized to expense over the option vesting period in determining the pro forma impact is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes single option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123
Revised 2004 SFAS No123R, which requires that compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. The compensation cost will be measured based on the fair value of the
equity or liability instruments issued. SFAS No123R will be effective for the Companys employee stock plans in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The Company plans to use the modified prospective method and is currently
evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.  In November
2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No43, Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted
material spoilage should be recognized as current period charges, and that fixed production overheads should be allocated to inventory based on normal capacity of production facilities. SFAS No151 is effective for inventory costs incurred
during fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No151 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position.  Reclassifications  Certain amounts previously reported, such as refundable federal income taxes, have been reclassified to conform with the
current year presentation. The reclassification had no impact on net income or earnings per share.  NOTE 3GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  The following table presents details of the Companys intangible assets, including the range of useful lives, excluding goodwill:  April 29, 2006

operating profit and cash flow assumptions, related to the Visual Media business unit of the Company recorded a $25,600 goodwill impairment charge. After
this impairment charge, $13,000 in goodwill, $300 in non-amortizable intangible assets and $10,800 of amortizable intangible assets remain related to this business unit. If the business does not perform as expected, it is possible that additional
impairments to the remaining goodwill and intangible assets could occur. We prepared a fair value assessment of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach which includes judgments regarding financial projections, including forecasted
cash flows and discount rates, and comparable market values. The impact of modifying any of these assumptions can have a significant impact on the estimate of fair value and, thus, the estimated recoverability, or impairment, if any, of the asset.

On February1, 2006, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which
replaced the existing credit facility and the $100,000 term loan used as partial financing for the Delta acquisition. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement matures on February1, 2011 and provides for a $350,000 revolving loan and an
available $100,000 incremental term loan. Interest accrues at a rate of, at the Companys option, either a Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of up to 175%, or the lenders base rate plus an applicable margin of up to 050%. The
Company also pays a commitment fee on the revolving loan of up to 0375% on unborrowed funds. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and contains certain financial covenants, including
a consolidated total and senior leverage ratio, a consolidated fixed charges coverage ratio and a limitation on consolidated capital expenditures. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at April29, 2006. The effective interest rate
under the credit facility for fiscal 2006 was 678%, which includes amortization of the loan origination fees of $658 and commitment fees on unborrowed funds of $464. The effective interest rate under the credit facility for fiscal 2005 was 844 which includes amortization of the loan origination fees of $498 and commitment fees on unborrowed funds of $891. As of April29, 2006, $267,400 was outstanding on the revolving loan, and no borrowings were made on the term loan during fiscal
2006.  During 2001, the Company sold an aggregate principal
amount of $149,500 of 60% convertible subordinated notes that were due in 2008. During 2004, the Company called the notes for redemption. Prior to redemption, certain holders of the notes exercised their right to convert $114,657 in aggregate
principal amount of the notes into 3,551 shares of the Companys common stock. The remaining $34,843 in aggregate principal amount of these notes were redeemed for the contractual redemption price of $36,038. The Company recognized pre-tax
expense of $1,839 in fiscal 2005 related to the write-off of deferred financing costs of $644 and the premium upon redemption of the notes of $1,195. An additional $2,117 of unamortized deferred financing fees was charged to capital paid-in excess
of par value related to this conversion.  During 2003, the
Company sold an aggregate principal amount of $133,000 of convertible subordinated notes due in 2023. The Company used the total net proceeds from the offering of $128,999 to repay a portion of the debt outstanding under the Companys credit
facility. The notes carry an annual interest rate of 375% until August1, 2010, at which time the notes will cease bearing interest and the original principal amount of each note will commence increasing daily by the annual rate of 375%.
Depending on the market price of the notes, the Company will make additional payments of interest commencing August1, 2008. The notes became convertible into shares of the Companys common stock at an initial conversion price of $4000
per share during fiscal 2006 and are recorded as a current liability. Holders of the notes may surrender the notes for conversion at any time from October1, 2005 until July31, 2023. Holders that exercise their right to convert the notes
will receive up to the accreted principal amount in cash, with the balance of the conversion obligation, if any, to be satisfied in shares of Company common stock or cash, at the Companys discretion. No notes have been converted into cash or
shares of common stock as of April29, 2006.  The Company
entered into two sale-leaseback transactions during fiscal 2001 which are accounted for as financings due to a technical default provision within the leases which could allow, under remote circumstances, for continuing ownership involvement by the
Company in the two properties.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  The Company and certain of its U.S.
subsidiaries entered into an agreement the Receivables Facility in November 2000 with a financial institution whereby it sells on a continuous basis an undivided interest in all eligible trade accounts receivable. Pursuant to the
Receivables Facility, the Company formed New School, Inc. NSI, a wholly-owned, special purpose, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary. As such, the assets of NSI will be available first and foremost to satisfy the claims of the creditors of
NSI. NSI was formed for the sole purpose of buying and selling receivables generated by the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company. Under the Receivables Facility, the Company and certain subsidiaries transfer without recourse all their
accounts receivables to NSI. NSI, in turn, has sold and, subject to certain conditions, may from time to time sell an undivided interest in these receivables. The Company receives a fee from the financial institution for billing and collection
functions, which remain the responsibility of the Company that approximates fair value. The facility was amended on February1, 2006 to extend its expiration to January31, 2007 and it may be extended further with the financial
institutions consent. In addition, the facility was amended to permit advances up to $175,000 from July1 through November30 of each year, and advances up to $75,000 from December1 through June30 of each year. The
Companys retained interests in the receivables sold are recorded at fair value, which approximates cost, due to the short-term nature of the receivables sold.  This two-step transaction is accounted for as a sale of receivables under the provision of SFAS No140,
Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities. There was $50,000 advanced under the Receivables Facility at April29, 2006 and $47,200 advanced at April30, 2005, accordingly,
these amounts of accounts receivable have been removed from the consolidated balance sheets. Costs associated with the sale of receivables, primarily related to the discount and loss on sale, were $3,592, $2,070 and $1,183 and are included in other
expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

24,125 194  The Company had
additional employee stock options outstanding of 0, 33 and 41 during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, that were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because they were anti-dilutive. The effect of convertible debt on the
Companys diluted EPS relates to the Companys 6% convertible subordinated notes which were redeemed and/or converted during fiscal 2005. Because the Company is required to satisfy in cash the portion of its conversion obligation equal to
the accreted principal amount, the 375% convertible subordinated notes did not have a material impact on the Companys diluted EPS.  Employee Stock Plans  The Company has two stock-based employee compensation plans. On June10, 1998, the Companys Board of Directors approved the School Specialty,
Inc. 1998 Stock Incentive Plan the 1998 Plan and on August27, 2002 the Companys Board of Directors approved the School Specialty, Inc. 2002 Stock Incentive Plan the 2002 Plan. Both plans have been approved by
the Companys shareholders. The purpose of the 1998 Plan and the 2002 Plan is to provide directors, officers, key employees and consultants with additional incentives by increasing their ownership interests in the Company. Under the 1998 Plan,
the maximum number of options available for grant is equal to 20% of the Companys outstanding common stock. Under the 2002 Plan, the maximum number of options available for grant is 1,500 shares.

The Company acquired several businesses during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. The results of these businesses have been included in the quarterly financial data since the dates of
acquisition.  The summation of quarterly net
income per share may not equate to the calculation for the full fiscal year as quarterly calculations are performed on a discrete basis.  Our business is subject to seasonal influences. Our historical revenues and profitability have been dramatically higher in the first two quarters of our
fiscal year, primarily due to increased shipments to customers coinciding with the start of each school year. Quarterly results also may be materially affected by the timing of acquisitions, the timing and magnitude of costs related to such
acquisitions, variations in our costs for the products sold, the mix of products sold and general economic conditions. Moreover, the operating margins of companies we acquire may differ substantially from our own, which could contribute to further
fluctuation in quarterly operating results. Therefore, results for any quarter are not indicative of the results that we may achieve for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we recorded an impairment charge
related to our Visual Media business unit of $26,600 pre-tax, representing goodwill impairment of $25,600 and product development cost impairment of $1,000. The charge primarily related to the declining financial performance of the video portion
of the Visual Media business. Delta Education, a seasonal business, was acquired in August 2005. The Companys third and fourth quarters correspond with Deltas off season. Delta generated operating losses of $3,921 and $2,316 in the third
and fourth quarters respectively.  NOTE 16MERGER TRANSACTION
On May31, 2005, the Company announced that it had
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, as amended, dated as of May31, 2005 the Merger Agreement, with LBW Holdings, Inc. and LBW Acquisition, Inc. On October25, 2005, a Termination and Release Agreement was entered
into by and among the Company, LBW Holdings, Inc. and LBW Acquisition, Inc. pursuant to which the Merger Agreement was terminated by mutual agreement and the parties released each other from certain claims. No termination fees were payable by the
Company or by LBW Holdings, Inc., and each party was responsible for its own merger-related expenses.  During fiscal 2006, the Company incurred $5,202 of costs related to the terminated merger transaction consisting of accounting, legal and other
transaction-related costs, including costs related to financial and legal advisors to the special committee of our Board of Directors. These costs have been included in the statement of operations for fiscal 2006.

Following the Companys announcement of the Merger Agreement on May31, 2005, the Company
was named as a defendant in three putative shareholder class actions. The complaints alleged that the Company and its directors breached fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders by negotiating and agreeing to the transaction at a price
that the plaintiffs claimed to be inadequate. On January17, 2006, the three putative shareholder class actions were dismissed.  NOTE 17SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  On June15, 2006 School Specialty, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program which gives School Specialty the
ability to purchase up to $50,000 of its issued and outstanding common stock. Purchases under this program may be made from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions. Common stock acquired through the repurchase program will
be available for general corporate purposes.

Unresolved Staff Comments  None. 
Item2. Controls and Procedures  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Based on an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this annual
report, the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the
Exchange Act are effective for the purposes set forth in the definition of the Exchange Act rules.  Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rule 13a-15f, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the board of
directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
assets of the Company;  2 provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and  3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation under the criteria in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of April29, 2006.
Managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting as of April29, 2006 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report dated July5, 2006, which is included herein. 
60  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of School Specialty, Inc. Greenville, Wisconsin  We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that
School Specialty, Inc., and subsidiaries the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of April29, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial
reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness
of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of April29, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April29, 2006, based on the criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended April29, 2006 of the Company and our report dated July5, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.
/s/DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP  Milwaukee, Wisconsin July5, 2006 
61  Changes in Internal Controls  No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 that has
materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.  Item9B. Other Information  Not applicable
