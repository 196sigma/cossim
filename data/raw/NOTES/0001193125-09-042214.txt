Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Central European
Distribution Corporation In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
income, shareholders equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Central European Distribution Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our integrated audits which were integrated audits in 2008 and 2007. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; ii provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. As described in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A,
Management has excluded the Parliament Group and the Whitehall Group from its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, because these companies were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations
during the year ended December 31, 2008. The Parliament Group is a subsidiary of the Company that is controlled by ownership of a majority voting interest, whose total assets and total revenues represent 910% and 788%, respectively, of the related
consolidated financial statements as of and 
54 Table of Contents
for the year ended December 31, 2008. With respect to the Whitehall Group, the Company acquired shares representing 50% minus one vote of the voting power,
and 75% of the economic interest. Total assets and total revenues of the Whitehall Group represent 907% and 1021%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008. PricewaterhouseCoopers Sp. z o.o. Warsaw, Poland March2, 2009

CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Amounts in tables expressed in thousands, except per share information 1. Organization and Significant
Accounting Policies Organization and Description of Business Central European Distribution Corporation CEDC, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries collectively referred to as we,
us, our, or the Company operate primarily in the alcohol beverage industry. The Company is Central Europes largest integrated spirit beverages business. The Company is the largest vodka producer by value
and volume in Poland and produces the Absolwent, Zubrowka, Bols and Soplica brands, among others. The Company currently exports its products to many markets around the world. In addition, it produces and distributes Royal Vodka, the number one
selling vodka in Hungary. The Company is the leading distributor and the leading importer of spirits, wine and beer in Poland and Hungary. In March 2008, the Company continued its expansion plans in the region by purchasing an 85% stake in
Copecresto Enterprises Limited, which owns the leading premium vodka brand in Russia, Parliament Vodka. In May 2008, the Company also acquired a 75% economic stake in the Whitehall Group of companies in Russia, which is one of the leading importers
of premium wines and spirits in Russia. In July2008, the Company closed a strategic investment in the Russian Alcohol Group Russian Alcohol providing the Company with an effective indirect equity stake of approximately 42% in
Russian Alcohol. Significant Accounting Policies The significant accounting policies and practices followed by the Company are as follows: Basis of Presentation
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. Our Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. CEDCs subsidiaries maintain their books of account and prepare their statutory financial statements in their respective local currencies. The
subsidiaries financial statements have been adjusted to reflect accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority
voting interest. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements. 
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions For all of the Companys subsidiaries the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities ofthese operations are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. The Income Statements are 
60 Table of Contents CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Amounts in tables expressed in thousands, except per share information 
translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the respective year. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates
from period to period are included as a component of stockholders equity. Transaction adjustments arising from operations as well as gains and losses from any specific foreign currency transactions are included in the reported net income for
the period. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been presented in U.S. Dollars. Tangible Fixed Assets Tangible fixed assets
are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is computed by the straight-line method over the following useful lives:  Type

Transportation equipment including capital leases

Leased equipment meeting appropriate criteria is capitalized and the present value of the related
lease payments is recorded as a liability. Amortization of capitalized leased assets is computed on a straight-line method over the useful life of the relevant assets. Where the cost of equipment is approximately $1,500 per transaction, it is expensed to the income statement as incurred. The Company periodically reviews its investment in tangible fixed assets and when indicators of impairment exist, an impairment loss is recognized. Goodwill Following the adoption of SFAS 141 and SFAS 142, goodwill and certain intangible
assets having indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization. Their book values are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently, if facts and circumstances indicate the need. Fair value measurement techniques, such as the discounted
cash flow methodology, are utilized to assess potential impairments. The testing is performed at each reporting unit level. In the discounted cash flow method, the Company discounts forecasted performance plans to their present value. The discount
rate utilized is the weighted average cost of capital for the reporting unit. USGAAP requires the impairment test to be performed in two stages. If the first stage does not indicate that the carrying values of the reporting units exceed the
fair values, the second stage is not required. When the first stage indicates potential impairment, the company has to complete the second stage of the impairment test and compare the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the
corresponding carrying value of goodwill.

Involvement of the Company in variable interest entities VIEs and continuing involvement with
transferred financial assets. On May23, 2008, the Company and certain of its affiliates, entered into, and closed upon, a
Share Sale and Purchase Agreement and certain other agreements whereby the Company acquired shares representing 50% minus one vote of the voting power, and 75% of the economic interests, in the Whitehall Group the Whitehall
Acquisition. Transfers of Financial Assets Except for the amount of $75 million that was lent at market rates as a working capital by the Company to the Whitehall Group there were no transfers of financial assets to VIE as the Whitehall Group is a self
financing body. Including the $75 million transfer, the Company does not have any continuing involvement with transferred financial assets that allow the transferors to receive cash flows or other benefits from the assets or requires the
transferors to provide cash flows or other assets in relation to the transferred financial assets. Variable Interest Entities
CEDC consolidated the Whitehall Group as a business combination as of May23, 2008, on the basis that the Whitehall Group is a
Variable Interest Entity VIE and the Company has been assessed as being the primary beneficiary. Included within the Whitehall Group is a 50/50 joint venture with Met Henessy. This joint venture is accounted for using the equity
method and is recorded on the face of the balance sheet in investments with minority interest initially recorded at fair value on the face of the balance sheet. The current term of the joint venture is until June 2013 at which point the Whitehall
Group will have the option to acquire the remaining shares of the entity. Based upon the review of Paragraph 4 CEDC management has
concluded that its interest in Puella Enterprises, the special purpose vehicle SPV, being a Cyprus company in which CEDC has 499% voting power, would not fall under any of scope exceptions. Therefore CEDC has evaluated whether the SPV
is a variable interest entity under the provisions of paragraph 5 and thus the SPV subject to consolidation accounting. In determining the
accounting treatment if the Whitehall Group is a VIE and needs to be consolidated by CEDC, we considered the conditions outlined in Paragraphs 5 a, b, or cof FIN 46R.  Paragraph 5aEquity Investment at RiskWe concluded that the SPV would not meet the requirement of a VIE based upon paragraph 5a as the
interest would be classified as equity under USGAAP, the at risk equity is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities. Neither equity holder will provide any additional material capital into the SPV. The SPV will be utilized
solely as a holding company with its economics determined by the underlying Whitehall Group.  Paragraph 5bControlling Financial InterestsBoth shareholders, Mark Kaufmann acting through a Jersey trust the Trust and CEDC, are
able to direct the activities and operations of the Whitehall Group through their roles on the Board of Directors and their responsibilities for selection of executive level officers. However, the ultimate obligation to absorb losses of the entity
or right to receive the residual benefits will lie with CEDC at the time the put/call term ends. Should the business not perform, the Trust will have the right to put his shares to CEDC with a pre-agreed floor on the value of the put option. Thus
the Company is at risk of absorbing a greater portion of losses upon the Trusts exit than the Trust itself. Conversely at the end of the term, CEDC can call and if the business has over performed, the amount paid to the Trust on the call is
capped at a pre-agreed amount. As such, because the Trust is both limited in its losses and returns through the terms of the put/call with caps and floors, this criterion is met and would cause Whitehall Group to be considered a VIE.
62 Table of Contents CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Amounts in tables expressed in thousands, except per share information  Paragraph 5cDisproportionate Voting RightsThe voting rights of the Trust and CEDC 501% and 499% are not proportionate to their economic
interests 25% and 75%. In this structure, it appears CEDC has disproportionately fewer voting rights in relation to its economic rights. Further, the below activities of the entity that are more closely associated with the activities of CEDC, thereby having substantially of the entitys activities conducted on its behalf. As CEDC has
disproportionately fewer rights while substantially all of Whitehall Groups activities are for CEDC, this would indicate that Whitehall Group lacks characteristic:  The operations of Whitehall Group are substantially similar in nature to the activities of CEDC;  CEDC has a call option to purchase the interests of the other investors in the entity;  The Trust has an option to put his interests to CEDC. Both the Trust and CEDC are precluded from transferring its interests in the SPV to any third-party without consent from the other party. Transfers are subject to an absolute other party discretion standard, other
than limited permitted transfers i.e., to affiliates. As such, it appears a de facto relationship exists. The primary factor to be
considered here is the design and intent of the variable interest entity. The SPV that holds the Whitehall Group and the related shareholders agreement were created with the clear intent to maximize the financial exposure that CEDC has to the
Whitehall Group business and to ultimately allow CEDC to take full control of the business in 2012. CEDC bears the greatest level of economic share of the entities performance, both in terms of profit allocation 75%and valuation of the
put/call option at the end with a clear floor and cap on payment. The put/call structure in place provide near assurance that at the end of the term CEDC will take full ownership of the business. Should the business perform at or above plan, CEDC
valuation is capped therefore would elect to call, and should the business under perform, the Trust will put the shares receiving the guaranteed minimum valuation. Purchase price allocations We account for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting in accordance
with SFAS 141, Business Combinations, and allocate the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The determination of the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as
associated asset useful lives, requires management to make estimates. Intangible assets other than Goodwill Intangibles consist primarily of acquired trademarks relating to well established brands, and as such have been deemed to have an indefinite life. In
accordance with SFAS 142, intangible assets with an indefinite life are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. Additional intangible assets include the valuation of customer contracts arising as a result of acquisitions,
these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life of 8 years. Equity investments If the Company is not required to consolidate its investment in another company, the Company uses the equity method if the Company can exercise
significant influence over the other company. Under the equity method, investments are carried at cost, plus or minus the Companys equity in the increases and decreases in the investees net assets after the date of acquisition and
certain other adjustments. The Companys share of the net 
63 Table of Contents CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Amounts in tables expressed in thousands, except per share information 
income or loss of the investee is included in equity in earnings of equity method investees on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Dividends received from the investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investments
may not be recoverable. Impairment of long lived assets In accordance with SFAS 144, the Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of
assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an
impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value. Revenue Recognition
Revenues of the Company include sales of its own produced spirit brands, imported wine, beer and spirit brands as well as other
third party alcoholic products purchased locally in Poland, the sale of each of these revenues streams are all processed and accounted for in the same manner. For all of its sources of revenue, the Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists, delivery of product has occurred, the sales price charged is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. This generally means that revenue is recognized when title to the products are transferred to our
customers. In particular, title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of the transactions. Sales are stated net of sales tax VAT and reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs,
including pricing discounts on single transactions, volume discounts, promotional listing fees and advertising allowances, cash discounts and rebates. Net sales revenue includes excise tax except in the case where the sales are made from the
production unit, in which case it is recorded net of excise tax. Revenue Dilution As part of normal business terms with customers, the Company for provides additional discounts and rebates off our stand list price for all of the
products we sell. These revenue reductions are documented in our contracts with our customers and are typically associated with annual or quarterly purchasing levels as well as payment terms. These rebates are divided into on-invoice and off-invoice
discounts. The on-invoice reductions are presented on the sales invoice and deducted from the invoice gross sales value. The off-invoice reductions are calculated based on the analysis performed by management and are provided for in the same period
the related sales are recorded. Discounts or fees that are subject to contractual based term arrangements are amortized over the term of the contract. For the twelve months ending December31, 2008, the Company recognized $1099 million of off
invoice rebates as a reduction to net sales. Certain sales contain customer acceptance provisions that grant a right of return on the
basis of either subjective criteria or specified objective criteria. Where appropriate a provision is made for product return, based upon a combination of historical data as well as depletion information received from our larger clients. The
Companys policy is to closely monitor inventory levels with our key distribution customers to ensure that we do not create excess stock levels in the market which would result in a return of sales in the future. Historically sales returns from
customers has averaged less than 1% of our net sales revenue.

Shipping and Handling Costs Where the Company has incurred costs in shipping goods to its warehouse facilities these costs are recorded as part of inventory and then to costs of
goods sold. Shipping and handling costs associated with distribution are recorded in Selling, General and Administrative S,GA costs. Accounts
Receivable Accounts receivables are recorded based on the invoice price, inclusive of VAT sales tax, and where a delivery note
has been signed by the customer and returned to the Company. The allowances for doubtful accounts are based upon the aging of the accounts receivable, whereby the Company makes an allowance based on a sliding scale. The Company typically does not
provide for past due amounts due from large international retail chains hypermarkets and supermarkets as there have historically not been any issues with collectability of these amounts. However, where circumstances require, the Company will also
make specific provisions for any excess not provided for under the general provision. When a final determination is delivered to the Company regarding the non-recovery of a receivable, the Company then charges the unrecoverable amount to the
accumulated allowance. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market value. Elements of cost include materials, labor and overhead and are classified as follows:  December31 2008
2007
Raw materials and supplies 18,352 19,051
In-process inventories 1,698 2,479
Finished goods and goods for resale 160,254 119,742 Total 180,304 141,272 Because of the nature of the products supplied by the Company, great attention is paid to
inventory rotation. Where goods are estimated to be obsolete or unmarketable they are written down to a value reflecting the net realizable value in their relevant condition. Cost includes customs duty where applicable, and all costs associated with bringing the inventory to a condition for sale. These costs include
importation, handling, storage and transportation costs, and exclude rebates received from suppliers, which are reflected as reductions to closing inventory. Inventories are comprised primarily of beer, wine, spirits, packaging materials and
non-alcoholic beverages. Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-term investments which have a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Income Taxes and Deferred Taxes The Company computes and records income taxes in accordance with the liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the accounting and tax basis of the underlying assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences
are expected to reverse.

Employee Retirement Provisions The Companys employees are entitled to retirement payments and in some cases payments for long-service jubilee awards and accordingly
the Company provides for the current value of the liability related to these benefits. A provision is calculated based on the terms set in the collective labor agreement. The amount of the provision for retirement bonuses depends on the age of
employees and the pre-retirement time of work for the Company and typically equals one months salary. The Company does not create a
specific fund designated for these payments and all payments related to the benefits are charged to the accrued liability. The provision for the employees benefits is calculated annually using the projected unit method and any losses or gains
resulting from the valuation are immediately recognized in the income statement. The Company also contributes to State and privately
managed defined contribution plans. Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. Employee Stock-Based Compensation As of January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No123R
Share-Based Payment requiring the recognition of compensation expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income related to the fair value of its employee share-based options. SFAS No123R revises SFAS No123
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion No25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No123R is supplemented by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No107
Share-Based Payment. SAB No107 expresses the SEC staffs views regarding the interaction between SFAS No123R and certain SEC rules and regulations including the valuation of share-based payments arrangements.
The Company recognizes the cost of all employee stock options on a straight-line attribution basis over their respective vesting periods,
net of estimated forfeitures. The Company has selected the modified prospective method of transition; accordingly, prior periods have not been restated. SFAS No123R Share-Based Payment requires the recognition of compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income related to the fair value of employee share-based options. Determining the
fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise, the associated volatility and the expected dividends. Judgment is also required in
estimating the amount of share-based awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting. If actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates, share-based compensation expense could be materially impacted. Prior to adopting SFAS
No123R, the Company applied Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, and related Interpretations, in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. All employee stock options were granted at or above the grant
date market price. Accordingly, no compensation cost was recognized for fixed stock option grants in prior periods. The Companys
2007 Stock Incentive Plan Incentive Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to directors, executives, and other employees employees of the
Company and to non-employee service providers of the Company. Following a shareholder resolution in April 2003 and the stock splits of May 2003,May 2004 and June 2006, the Incentive Plan authorizes, and the Company has reserved for future
issuance, up to 1,397,333 shares of Common Stock subject to an anti-dilution adjustment in the event of a stock split, re-capitalization, or similar transaction. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company administers the
Incentive Plan. 
66 Table of Contents CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Amounts in tables expressed in thousands, except per share information 
The option exercise price for stock options granted under the Incentive Plan may not be less than
fair market value but in some cases may be in excess of the closing price of the Common Stock on the date of grant. The Company uses the stock option price based on the closing price of the Common Stock on the day before the date of grant if such
price is not materially different than the opening price of the Common Stock on the day of the grant. Stock options may be exercised up to 10 years after the date of grant except as otherwise provided in the particular stock option agreement.
Payment for the shares must be in cash, which must be received by the Company prior to any shares being issued. Stock options granted to directors and officers as part of an employee employment contract vest after 2 years. Stock options granted to
general employees as part of a loyalty program vest after three years. The Incentive Plan was approved by CEDC shareholders during the annual shareholders meeting on April30, 2007 to replace the Companys 1997 Stock Incentive Plan the
Old Stock Incentive Plan, which expired in November 2007. The Stock Incentive Plan will expire in November 2017. The terms and conditions of the Stock Incentive Plan are substantially similar to those of the Old Stock Incentive Plan.
Before January1, 2006 CEDC, the holding company, realized net operating losses and therefore an excess tax benefit windfall
resulting from the exercise of the awards and a related credit to Additional Paid-in Capital APIC of $22 million was not recorded in the Companys books. The excess tax benefits and the credit to APIC for the windfall should not be recorded
until the deduction reduces income taxes payable on the basis that cash tax savings have not occurred. The Company will recognize the windfall upon realization. See Note 13 for more information regarding stock-based compensation, including pro forma information required under SFAS No123 for periods prior to Fiscal 2006. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company
uses derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative
financial instruments are recognized periodically in either income or in shareholders equity as a component of comprehensive income depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it
qualifies as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Generally, changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments accounted for
as fair value hedges are recorded in income along with the portions of the changes in the fair values of the hedged items that relate to the hedged risks. Changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments not qualifying as hedges are
reported in income. At the inception of a transaction the Company documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This
process includes linking all derivatives designated to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company also documents its assessment, both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivative financial
instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Comprehensive Income/Loss Comprehensive income/loss is defined as all changes in equity during a period except
those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Comprehensive income includes net income adjusted by, among other items, foreign currency translation adjustments. The translation losses/gains on the re-measurements from
foreign currencies primarily the Polish Zloty to US dollars are classified separately as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity. 
67 Table of Contents CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Amounts in tables expressed in thousands, except per share information 
As of December31, 2008, the Polish zloty exchange rate used to translate the balance sheet
weakened as compared to the exchange rate as of December31, 2007, and as a result a loss to comprehensive income was recognized. Additionally, translation gains and losses with respect to long-term subordinated inter-company loans with the
parent company are charged to other comprehensive income. No deferred tax benefit has been recorded on the comprehensive income in regard to the long-term inter-company transactions with the parent company, as the repayment of any equity investment
is not anticipated in the foreseeable future. Segment Reporting The Company primarily operates in one industry segment, the production and sale of alcoholic beverages. As a result of the Companys expansion into
new geographic areas, namely Russia, the Company has implemented a segmental approach to the business based upon geographic locations. Net Income
per Common Share Net income per common share is calculated in accordance with SFAS No128, Earnings per Share.
Basic earnings per share EPS are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted- average number of common shares outstanding for the year. The stock options and warrants discussed in Note 10 were included in the
computation of diluted earnings per common share Note 18. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141-R, Business Combinations. This Statement applies prospectively to business combinations
for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2008, which are business combinations in the year ending December31, 2009 for the Company. The objective
of this Statement is to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements SFAS 160, which the
Company will adopt on January1, 2009.SFAS 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No51, Consolidated Financial Statements ARB 51 and establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a
subsidiary and for the accounting for future ownership changes with respect to those subsidiaries. The most significant impact of the standard, at adoption, will be to retrospectively reclassify our minority interests $48 million at
December31, 2008 from a liability to a separate component of stockholders equity and to retrospectively reclassify income from minority interests from a component of net income to income attributable to the parent company $10 million for the
year ended December31, 2008 which will be presented below net income. All other components of SFAS 160 will be applied prospectively. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging ActivitiesAn Amendment of SFAS No133. SFAS 161 seeks to improve financial reporting for derivative instruments
and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures regarding the impact on financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. To achieve this increased transparency, SFAS 161 requires 1the disclosure of the fair value of
derivative instruments and gains and losses in a tabular format; 2the disclosure of derivative features that are credit risk-related; and 3cross-referencing within the footnotes. SFAS 161 is effective for us on January1, 2009.
We are in the process of evaluating the new disclosure requirements under SFAS 161. 
68 Table of Contents CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Amounts in tables expressed in thousands, except per share information 
In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB 14-1, which impacts the accounting treatment for convertible
debt instruments that allow for either mandatory or optional cash settlements. FSP APB 14-1 will impact the accounting associated with our $3100 million senior convertible notes. This FSP will require us to recognize significant additional
non-cash interest expense based on the market rate for similar debt instruments without the conversion feature. Furthermore, it requires recognizing interest expense in prior periods pursuant to the retrospective accounting treatment. FSP APB 14-1
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008 our fiscal 2009 and early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact on our financial statements of applying the provisions of FSP APB 14-1. Assuming
applicable market rate, we would be required to record additional non-cash interest expense of approximately $37 million annually. On a retrospective basis we would be required to reflect additional non-cash interest of approximately $28 million
for fiscal 2008. 2. Acquisitions On
March11, 2008, the Company and certain of its affiliates entered into a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement and certain other agreements with White Horse Intervest Limited, a British Virgin Islands Company, and certain of White Horses
affiliates, relating to the Companys acquisition from White Horse of 85% of the share capital of Copecresto Enterprises Limited, a Cypriot company, the Parliament Acquisition. In connection with this acquisition, the Company paid
a consideration of approximately $180 million in cash and 22million shares of common stock. On May2, 2008 the Company delivered the remaining 250,000 shares of the share consideration. There is still $15 million of the cash
consideration that is deferred pending the consummation of certain reorganization transactions expected to be completed over the next 3-9 months. On May23, 2008, the Company and certain of its affiliates, entered into, and closed upon, a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement and certain other agreements whereby the Company acquired shares representing 50% minus one vote of the
voting power, and 75% of the economic interests, in the Whitehall Group the Whitehall Acquisition. The Whitehall Group is a leading importer of premium spirits and wines in Russia. The aggregate consideration paid by the Company was
$200 million, paid in cash at the closing. In addition, on October21, 2008 the Company issued to the Seller 843,524 shares of its common stock, par value $001 per share. On February24, 2009, the Company and the seller amended the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement governing the Whitehall acquisition to satisfy
the Companys obligations to the seller pursuant to a share price guarantee in the original Stock Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of this amendment, the Company paid to the seller $5,876,351 in cash, and issued to the seller 2,100,000
shares of its common stock, in settlement of a minimum share price guarantee by the Company. The Company is further obligated to make an additional cash payment of $2,000,000 on March15, 2009. Deferred payments already due under the original
Stock Purchase Agreement are to be paid with 8,050,411 due on June15, 2009 and 8,303,630 due on September15, 2009. In consideration for these payments, the Company received an additional 375 Class B shares of Whitehall, which
represents an increase in the Companys economic stake from 75% to 80%. Additionally, if, during the 210 day period immediately following the effectiveness of the registration statement the Company is obligated to file to register the shares of
Company common stock obtained by the seller in this transaction, the seller sells any of the Company common stock it acquired in the transaction for an average sales price per share, weighted by volume, that is less than $1203, per share, the
Company must pay to the seller the excess, if any, of $1203 over the volume weighted average sales price per share of the Companys common stock on the day the sale took place, multiplied by the total number of shares sold. Finally, the
Company may be obligated to make an additional cash payment to the seller, ranging from 0 to 1,500,000, based upon whether and to what extent the price of a share of the Companys common stock exceeds $1203 during that same 210 day
period. If the Company must make any such payment, it will receive in return up to an additional 75 Class B shares, which represents up to an additional 1% economic stake of Whitehall, based on the sized of the payment.

The Company has consolidated the Whitehall Group as a business combination as of May23, 2008,
on the basis that the Whitehall Group is a Variable Interest Entity and the Company has been assessed as being the primary beneficiary. Included within the Whitehall Group is a 50/50 joint venture with Met Henessy. This joint venture is
accounted for using the equity method and is recorded on the face of the balance sheet in investments with minority interest initially recorded at fair value on the face of the balance sheet. The current term of the joint venture is until June 2013
at which point the Whitehall Group will have the option to acquire the remaining shares of the entity. On July9, 2008, the Company
completed its strategic investment in Russian Alcohol Group and 1paid $1815 million for approximately 475% of the common equity of a newly formed Cayman Islands company Cayco which indirectly acquired all of the outstanding
equity of Russian Alcohol Group the Acquisition, and 2purchased $1035 million in subordinated exchangeable loan notes the Notes issued by a subsidiary of Cayco and exchangeable into equity of Cayco. Pursuant to
the shareholders agreement entered into in connection with this strategic investment, the Company has the right to purchase, and Cayco has the right to require the Company to purchase, all but not less than all of the outstanding capital
stock of a majority-owned subsidiary of Cayco Cayco Sub held by Cayco, which in either case would give the Company indirect control over Russian Alcohol Group. The Companys right is exercisable during two 45-day periods, the first commencing on the later of 1the date that the audited 2009 Operating
Group accounts are approved by Cayco Sub and 2the date on which all earnout payments that are payable in connection with the Acquisition have been paid the 2010 Period, and the second commencing on the date that the audited
2010 Operating Group accounts are approved by Cayco Sub the 2011 Period. The Companys right may be extended after the end of the 2011 Period in a limited circumstance to a period commencing on the date that the audited 2011
Operating Group accounts are approved by Cayco Sub the 2012 Period. If the Company exercises its right, Cayco will be obligated to exercise its drag-along rights under the shareholders agreement governing Cayco Sub to cause the
transfer to the Company, on the same terms, the remaining capital stock of Cayco Sub not held by Cayco. Caycos right will be exercisable during the 2010 Period and the 2011 Period and will expire one day after the end of the 2011 Period, and
will be extended if the Companys right is extended to the 2012 Period. The price the Company would be required to pay in the event
either of these rights is exercised will be equal to the adjusted equity value of Russian Alcohol Group, determined based on EBITDA multiplied by the product of Caycos ownership percentage and 1405, 1314, or 1280, depending on when the
right is exercised, less the debt of Russian Alcohol Group plus certain adjustments for cash and working capital. That price, however, in the case of the Companys right, is subject to a floor equal to the total original euro equivalent amount
based upon a exchange rate of 157 invested by the other party in Cayco multiplied by 205 in 2010 or 220 in 2009 and converted back to U.S. dollars at the spot rate at the time, depending on when the right is exercised in either case less any
dividends or distributions actually received. Russian Alcohol Group has approximately $200 million of net indebtedness in place that, following any exercise of the Companys or Caycos rights described above, may be required to be
refinanced or retired by the terms of the Companys existing indebtedness. The Companys management currently estimates that the amount the Company would be required to pay would be between $350 million and $650 million payable in mid-
2010 if the above rights are exercised. This estimate is based on currently available information and managements current views with respect to future events and the future financial performance of Russian Alcohol Group, as of the date
hereof. These estimates, projections and views are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from managements current estimates, projections and views, including the effects of fluctuations in currency
valuations between the U.S. dollar and the Russian ruble and U.S. dollar and Euro, and the risks and uncertainties identified in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

We are engaged in discussions with Lion Capital to restructure the current agreement regarding the
buyout of the remaining 58% stake in the Russian Alcohol Group, the largest spirit producer in Russia. Although the discussions are not final, and remain subject to further legal, accounting and tax analysis, as well as board approval, we are in
general agreement with Lion Capital on the main commercial objectives. We expect an agreement would include a fixed price for the remaining 58% interest in the Russian Alcohol Group that we do not own including the conversion of our $1035 million
plus accrued interest of loan notes at a valuation that is more reflective of current market conditions and the positive sales performance of the business. Our payments would be spread out over 5 years ending in the year 2013, with smaller payments
for 2009 and 2013 and more equal payments from years 2010 to 2012, and we would agree to certain security arrangements to Lion. We would not take control over the Russian Alcohol Group until 2011, though we would receive significantly enhanced
minority rights. We would expect to finance the transaction over the 5 years through a combination of cash, debt and equity. We cannot provide any assurances as to whether, or on what terms, we may reach an agreement to restructure our arrangements
in respect of the Russian Alcohol Group. The fair value of the net assets acquired in connection with the 2008 Parliament and Whitehall

The goodwill arising out of the Parliament and Whitehall acquisitions is attributable to the
immediate platform for expansion in Russia that they provide to the Company. The Company is in the process of completing its valuations and refining its purchase price adjustments for Whitehall, which is expected to be finalized by March 31, 2009.
The primary areas of further review include finalizing fixed asset and intangible asset valuations. As such, the allocation of the purchase price is subject to further adjustments. The Company has not presented pro-forma results of operations of the Company to give effect to these acquisitions as if the acquisitions had occurred on
January1, 2008 and 2007 because there are no pre-closing interim results from Parliament and Whitehall that are available on a basis similar to US GAAP. The companies were not required to prepare interim consolidated financial statements and
as such have only statutory tax accounts available. The Company believes that the inclusion of this information would provide misleading information for the investor. The Company is in the process of completing its valuations and calculation its purchase price adjustments related to the acquisition in Russian Alcohol Group, which are expected to be quantified by March31,
2009. 3. Exchangable Convertible Notes On July9, 2008, the Company closed a strategic investment in the Russian Alcohol Group Russian Alcohol and in addition to the equity investment, CEDC purchased exchangeable notes from Lion/Rally Lux 3 Lion
Lux, a Luxembourg company and indirect subsidiary of a Cayman Islands company Cayco that served as the investment vehicle. The Notes rank pari passu with the other unsecured obligations of Lion Lux. represent a direct and unsecured obligation of Lion Lux and are structurally subordinated to indebtedness of subsidiaries of Lion Lux, including Pasalba Limited
Pasalba, a company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Cyprus that made the investment. The Notes have a principal amount of $1035 million and accrue interest at a rate of 83%per annum, which interest may, at Lion
Luxs option, be paid in kind with additional Notes. Lion Lux will be required to redeem the Notes at their principal amount,
together with any accrued but unpaid interest, on the date that is ten years and six months after the closing of the investment the Maturity Date. Upon a change in control of Cayco or its majority-owned subsidiary Cayco
Sub that occurs when no Exchange Right as defined below has been exercised, the Company will be permitted to request that Lion Lux redeem any Notes in respect of which such Exchange Right has not been exercised, at their principal amount
plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Furthermore, Lion Lux will be permitted to redeem any Note at any time after the expiration of the Companys right to purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of Cayco Sub held by Cayco the
Call Option under the Shareholders Agreement governing the investment, subject to the Exchange Right. Each holder of
Notes has the right to require Cayco to purchase its Notes in exchange for the issue by Cayco of additional shares of Cayco stock the Exchange Right. Holders of Notes will be permitted to exercise the Exchange Right only one time
during certain 45-day periods in each of 2010 the 2010 Period, 2011 the 2011 Period and, if the Call Option is extended into 2012 pursuant to its terms, 2012 the 2012 Period; provided, that in the event the
Call Option or Caycos right to require the Company to purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of Cayco Sub held by Cayco the Put Option is exercised during any such period, holders will be required to exercise the Exchange
Right within 10 business days after notice of the exercise of the Call Option or Put Option. The Exchange Right may also be exercised in the event of an initial public offering. The Exchange Right will expire one day after the end of the 2012
Period.

The number of additional shares of Cayco stock that will be issued in connection with any exercise of
an Exchange Right will be calculated as a function of, among other things, the number of shares of Cayco stock then outstanding, the number of shares of Cayco Sub stock then outstanding, the number of shares of Cayco Sub stock then held by Cayco,
the principal and accrued interest of the Notes pursuant to which the Exchange Right was exercised, and the equity value of Pasalba and its subsidiaries based on 1if the Exchange Right is exercised during the 2010 Period, Pasalbas and
its subsidiaries 2009 EBITDA multiplied by 130, 2if the Exchange Right is exercised during the 2011 Period, Pasalbas and its subsidiaries 2010 EBITDA multiplied by 125, or 3if the Exchange Right is exercised
during the 2012 Period, Pasalbas and its subsidiaries 2011 EBITDA multiplied by 120 and, in each such case, subject to further adjustment for debt, cash and working capital. The maximum percentage which such newly issued Cayco shares
will represent in the share capital of Cayco, on a look-through basis, following their issue will be equal to that percentage of Cayco shares being approximately 19%, 21% and 23% in respect of the 2010 Period, 2011 Period and 2012 Period,
respectively the Notional Shares, which the Notional Shares would represent on the date of exchange if the relevant holder had not subscribed for the note but had instead subscribed for the Notional Shares on the date of the
Exchangeable Note Instrument. Lion Lux is prohibited from paying dividends or making other distributions to its shareholders without the
consent of the holders of Notes representing two thirds in nominal value of the Notes outstanding, other than in connection with repayment of loan notes issued by the parent of Lion Lux to the sellers of RAG. In addition, the holders of Notes
representing two thirds in nominal value of the Notes outstanding have certain approval rights relating to certain matters, including, but not limited to, ithe incurring of any indebtedness by Lion Lux which is either senior to the Notes or
secured, and iiany acquisition by Cayco or any subsidiary of Cayco with consideration payable in excess of $50 million. Holders of Notes are permitted to transfer Notes to any person, subject to certain exceptions and a right of first
refusal which will be granted to an affiliate of Lion. We are engaged in discussions with Lion Capital to restructure the current
agreement regarding the buyout of the remaining 58% stake in the Russian Alcohol Group, the largest spirit producer in Russia. Although the discussions are not final, and remain subject to further legal, accounting and tax analysis, as well as board
approval, we are in general agreement with Lion Capital on the main commercial objectives. We expect an agreement would include a fixed price for the remaining 58% interest in the Russian Alcohol Group that we do not own including the conversion of
our $1035 million plus accrued interest of loan notes at a valuation that is more reflective of current market conditions and the positive sales performance of the business. Our payments would be spread out over 5 years ending in the year 2013,
with smaller payments for 2009 and 2013 and more equal payments from years 2010 to 2012, and we would agree to certain security arrangements to Lion. We would not take control over the Russian Alcohol Group until 2011, though we would receive
significantly enhanced minority rights. We would expect to finance the transaction over the 5 years through a combination of cash, debt and equity. We cannot provide any assurances as to whether, or on what terms, we may reach an agreement to
restructure our arrangements in respect of the Russian Alcohol Group.

brand recognition within their market segments based on the length of time they have existed, the comparatively high volumes sold and their general market positions relative to other products in their respective market segments. These trademarks
include Soplica, Zubrwka, Absolwent, Royal, Parliament and the rights for Bols Vodka in Poland, Hungary and Russia. Taking the above into consideration, as well as the evidence provided by analyses of vodka products life cycles, market
studies, competitive and environmental trends, management believes that these brands will generate cash flows for an indefinite period of time, and that the useful lives of these brands are indefinite. In accordance with SFAS 142, intangible assets
with an indefinite life are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. Estimated aggregate future amortization
expenses for intangible assets that have a definite life are as follows:  2009 1,343

On May23, 2008, the Company and certain of its affiliates, entered into, and closed upon, a
Share Sale and Purchase Agreement and certain other agreements whereby the Company acquired shares representing 50% minus one vote of the voting power, and 75% of the economic interests, in the Whitehall Group the Whitehall
Acquisition. The Whitehall Group is a leading importer of premium spirits and wines in Russia. The aggregate consideration paid by the Company was $200 million, paid in cash at the closing. In addition, on October21, 2008 the Company
issued to the Seller 843,524 shares of its common stock, par value $001 per share. On February24, 2009, the Company and the seller
amended the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement governing the Whitehall acquisition to satisfy the Companys obligations to the seller pursuant to a share price guarantee in the original Stock Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of this
amendment, the Company paid to the seller $5,876,351 in cash, and issued to the seller 2,100,000 shares of its common stock, in settlement of a minimum share price guarantee by the Company. The Company is further obligated to make an additional cash
payment of $2,000,000 on March15, 2009. Deferred payments already due under the original Stock Purchase Agreement are to be paid with 8,050,411 due on June15, 2009 and 8,303,630 due on September15, 2009. In
consideration for these payments, the Company received an additional 375 Class B shares of Whitehall, which represents an increase in the Companys economic stake from 75% to 80%. Additionally, if, during the 210 day period immediately
following the effectiveness of the registration statement the Company is obligated to file to register the shares of Company common stock obtained by the
seller in this transaction, the seller sells any of the Company common stock it acquired in the transaction for an average sales price per share, weighted by volume, that is less than $1203, per share, the Company must pay to the seller the excess,
if any, of $1203 over the volume weighted average sales price per share of the Companys common stock on the day the sale took place, multiplied by the total number of shares sold. Finally, the Company may be obligated to make an additional
cash payment to the seller, ranging from 0 to 1,500,000, based upon whether and to what extent the price of a share of the Companys common stock exceeds $1203 during that same 210 day period. If the Company must make any such
payment, it will receive in return up to an additional 75 Class B shares, which represents up to an additional 1% economic stake of Whitehall, based on the sized of the payment. The Company has consolidated the Whitehall Group as a business combination as of May23, 2008, on the basis that the Whitehall Group is a Variable
Interest Entity and the Company has been assessed as being the primary beneficiary. Included within the Whitehall Group is a 50/50 joint venture with Met Henessy. This joint venture is accounted for using the equity method and is recorded on
the face of the balance sheet in investments with minority interest initially recorded at fair value on the face of the balance sheet. The current term of the joint venture is until June 2013 at which point the Whitehall Group will have the option
to acquire the remaining shares of the entity. On July9, 2008, the Company closed on its acquisition of approximately 475% of the
common equity of a Cayman Islands company, referred to as Cayco, for approximately $1815 million in cash, and purchased $1035 million in subordinated exchangeable loan notes from a subsidiary of Cayco. Lion Capital LLP and certain of its
affiliates and other financial investors own the remaining common equity of Cayco, which indirectly own approximately 884% of the outstanding equity of the Russian Alcohol Group. The Russian Alcohol Group, also referred to as RAG, is
the leading vodka producer in Russia.

owners. Comprehensive income/loss includes net income adjusted by, among other items, foreign currency translation adjustments. The foreign translation losses/gains on the re-measurements from foreign currencies to U.S. dollars are classified
separately as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity. As of December31, 2008,
the Polish Zloty exchange rate used to translate the balance sheet weakened by approximately 213% as compared to the exchange rate as of December31, 2007, and as a result a comprehensive loss was recognized. Additionally, translation gains
and losses with respect to long-term subordinated inter-company loans with the parent company are charged to other comprehensive income. No deferred tax benefit has been recorded on the comprehensive income/loss in regard to the long-term
inter-company transactions with the parent company, as the repayment of any equity investment is not anticipated in the foreseeable future. 10. Accrued

Notes is presented together with Senior Secured Notes balance. In January 2009, the remaining portion of the IRS hedge related to the Senior Secured Notes
was closed and written off with a net cash settlement of approximately $19 million. 11. Borrowings Bank Facilities As of December31, 2008, $130
million remained available under the Companys overdraft facilities. These overdraft facilities are renewed on an annual basis. As of December31, 2008, the Company had utilized approximately $811 million of a multipurpose credit line
agreement in connection with the 2007 tender offer in Poland to purchase the remaining outstanding shares of Polmos Bialystok S.A. The Companys obligations under the credit line agreement are guaranteed through promissory notes by certain
subsidiaries of the Company. The indebtedness under the credit line agreement matures on March31, 2009, however a new credit agreement , with substantially the same terms and conditions as the existing credit facility, was signed on
February24, 2009 extending the facility to February 24, 2011. The Company also has received a firm bank commitment to roll over the short term working capital facility of approximately $289 million due March 31, 2009 to March31, 2010.
On April24, 2008, the Company signed a credit agreement with Bank Zachodni WBK SA in Poland to provide up to $50 million of
financing to be used to finance a portion of the Parliament and Whitehall acquisition, as well as general working capital needs of the Company. The agreement provides for a $30 million five year amortizing term facility and a one year $20 million
short term facility with annual renewal. On July2, 2008, the Company entered into a Facility Agreement with Bank Handlowy w
Warszawie S.A., which provided for a term loan facility of $40 million. The term loan matures on July4, 2011 and is guaranteed by CEDC, Carey Agri and certain other subsidiaries of the Company and is secured by all of the shares of capital
stock of Carey Agri and subsequently will be further secured by shares of capital stock in certain other subsidiaries of CEDC. Senior Secured Notes

tax assets and liabilities. The Company does not file a tax return in Delaware based upon its consolidated income, but does file a return in Delaware based on the income statement for transactions occurring in the United States of America.
The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation
of FASB Statement 109, effective January1, 2007. Interpretation 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in
a tax return. Benefits from tax positions should be recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full
knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax
positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet
the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. Interpretation 48 also provides guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of
unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties. Adoption of Interpretation 48 did not have a significant impact on the Corporations financial statements. The company is currently generating tax loss carry forwards in the United States at a
35% tax rate, which has the effect of reducing the overall effective tax rate below the 19% Polish statutory rate. The Company files
income tax returns in the U.S., Poland, Hungary, Russia, as well as in various other countries throughout the world in which we conduct our business. The major tax jurisdictions and their earliest fiscal years that are currently open for tax
examinations are 2003 in the U.S., 2002 in Poland and Hungary and 2005 in Russia.  Year ended December 31 2008

CEDCs U.S. federal income tax returns are also subject to examination by the U.S. tax
authorities. As the application of tax laws and regulations, and transactions are susceptible to varying interpretations, amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements could be changed at a later date upon final determination by the tax
authorities. 13. Stock Option Plans and Warrants As of January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No123R Share-Based Payment requiring the recognition of compensation expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income related to the
fair value of its employee share-based options. SFAS No123R revises SFAS No123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion No25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS
No123R is supplemented by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No107 Share-Based Payment. SAB No107 expresses the SEC staffs views regarding the interaction between SFAS No123R and certain
SEC rules and regulations including the valuation of share-based payments arrangements. The Company recognizes the cost of all employee
stock options on a straight-line attribution basis over their respective vesting periods, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company has selected the modified prospective method of transition; accordingly, prior periods have not been restated.
SFAS No123R Share-Based Payment requires the recognition of compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of
Income related to the fair value of employee share-based options. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise,
the associated volatility and the expected dividends. Judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting. If actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates, share-based
compensation expense could be materially impacted. Prior to adopting SFAS No123R, the Company applied Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, and related Interpretations, in accounting for its stock-based
compensation plans. All employee stock options were granted at or above the grant date market price. Accordingly, no compensation cost was recognized for fixed stock option grants in prior periods. The Companys 2007 Stock Incentive Plan Incentive Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock and restricted stock units to directors, executives, and other employees employees of the Company and to non-employee service providers of the Company. Following a shareholder resolution in April 2003 and the stock splits of May
2003,May 2004 and June 2006, the Incentive Plan authorizes, and the Company has reserved for future issuance, up to 1,397,333 shares of Common Stock subject to an anti-dilution adjustment in the event of a stock split, re-capitalization, or
similar transaction. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company administers the Incentive Plan. The option
exercise price for stock options granted under the Incentive Plan may not be less than fair market value but in some cases may be in excess of the closing price of the Common Stock on the date of grant. The Company uses the stock option price based
on the closing price of the Common Stock on the day before the date of grant if such price is not materially different than the opening price of the Common Stock on the day of the grant. Stock options may be exercised up to 10 years after the date
of grant except as otherwise provided in the particular stock option agreement. Payment for the shares must be in cash, which must be received by the Company prior to any shares being issued. Stock options granted to directors and officers as part
of an employee employment contract vest after 2 years. Stock options granted to general employees as part of a loyalty program vest after three years. The Incentive Plan was approved by CEDC shareholders during the annual shareholders meeting on
April30, 2007 to replace the Companys 1997 Stock Incentive Plan the Old Stock Incentive Plan, which expired in November 2007. The Stock Incentive Plan will expire in November 2017. The terms and conditions of the Stock
Incentive Plan are substantially similar to those of the Old Stock Incentive Plan.

Before January1, 2006 CEDC, the holding company, realized net operating losses and therefore an
excess tax benefit windfall resulting from the exercise of the awards and a related credit to Additional Paid-in Capital APIC of $22 million was not recorded in the Companys books. The excess tax benefits and the credit to APIC for the
windfall should not be recorded until the deduction reduces income taxes payable on the basis that cash tax savings have not occurred. The Company will recognize the windfall upon realization.

During 2008, the range of exercise prices for outstanding options was $113 to $6092. During 2008,
the weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding was 55 years. Exercise prices for options exercisable as of December31, 2008 ranged from $113 to $4415. The Company has also granted 38,129 restricted stock units to its
employees at an average price of $6652. The Company has issued stock options to employees under stock based compensation plans. Stock
options are issued at the current market price, subject to a vesting period, which varies from one to three years. As of December31, 2008, the Company has not changed the terms of any outstanding awards. During the twelve months ended December31, 2008, the Company recognized compensation cost of $385 million and a related deferred tax asset of
$076 million. As of December31, 2008, there was $64 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock
options and restricted stock units granted under the Plan. The costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 19 months through 2009-2011. Total cash received from exercise of options during the twelve months ended December31, 2008 amounted to $19 million. For the twelve month period ended December31, 2008, the compensation expense related to all options was calculated based on the fair value of each option grant using the binomial distribution model. The Company
has never paid cash dividends and does not currently have plans to pay cash dividends, and thus has assumed a 0% dividend yield. Expected volatilities are based on average of implied and historical volatility projected over the remaining term of the
options. The expected life of stock options is estimated based on historical data on exercise of stock options, post-vesting forfeitures and other factors to estimate the expected term of the stock options granted. The risk-free interest rates are
derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for instruments with a remaining term similar to the expected life of the options. In addition, the Company applies an expected forfeiture rate when amortizing stock-based
compensation expenses. The estimate of the forfeiture rates is based primarily upon historical experience of employee turnover. As individual grant awards become fully vested, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted to recognize actual
forfeitures. The following weighted-average assumptions were used in the calculation of fair value:  2008

14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities The Company is involved in litigation from time to time and has claims against it in connection with matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
In the opinion of management, the outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys operations. As part of the Share Purchase Agreement related to the October 2005 Polmos Bialystok Acquisition, the Company is required to ensure that Polmos Bialystok will make investments of at least 775million Polish Zloty during the five years
after the acquisition was consummated. As of December31, 2008, the Company had invested 621million Polish Zloty approximately $210 million in Polmos Bialystok.

Pursuant to the shareholders agreement governing the Companys investment in Copecresto
Enterprises Limited, the Company has the right to purchase all but not less than all of the shares of Copecresto capital stock held by the other shareholder. The other shareholder has the right to require the Company to purchase any or all of the
shares of Copecresto capital stock held by such other shareholder; provided, that such other shareholder may not exercise this right other than in respect of all of the shares of Copecresto capital stock it holds if the amount of Copecresto capital
stock subject to such exercise is less than 1% of the total outstanding capital stock of Copecresto. The Companys right may be
exercised beginning on March13, 2015 and will terminate on the earliest to occur of 1the delivery of a notice of default under the shareholders agreement, 2the delivery of a notice of the other shareholders exercise
of its right in respect of all of the Copecresto capital stock held by such shareholder and 3the date that is ten years after the date of completion of certain reorganization transactions relating to Copecresto. The other shareholders
right may be exercised beginning on March13, 2011 and will terminate on the earliest to occur of Athe delivery of a notice of default under the shareholders agreement, Bthe Companys exercise of its right and
Cthe date that is ten years after the date of completion of certain reorganization transactions relating to Copecresto. The other shareholder also may exercise its right one or more times within the three months following any change in
control of the Company or of Bols Sp. z o.o., a subsidiary of the Company. The aggregate price that the Company would be required to pay
in the event either of these rights is exercised will be equal to the product of xa fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of shares of capital stock of Copecresto covered by the exercise of the right, and the denominator of
which is the total number of shares of capital stock of Copecresto then outstanding, multiplied by ythe EBITDA of Copecresto from the year immediately preceding the year in which the right is exercised, multiplied by z12, if the
right is exercised in 2010 or before, 11, if the right is exercised in 2011, or 10, if the right is exercised in 2012 or later; provided, that in no event will the product of yand z, above, be less than $300,000,000. On May23, 2008, the Company and certain of its affiliates, entered into, and closed upon, a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement and certain other
agreements whereby the Company acquired shares representing 50% minus one vote of the voting power, and 75% of the economic interests, in the Whitehall Group the Whitehall Acquisition. The Whitehall Group is a leading importer of
premium spirits and wines in Russia. The aggregate consideration paid by the Company was $200 million, paid in cash at the closing. In addition, on October21, 2008 the Company issued to the Seller 843,524 shares of its common stock, par value
$001 per share. On February24, 2009, the Company and the seller amended the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement governing the
Whitehall acquisition to satisfy the Companys obligations to the seller pursuant to a share price guarantee in the original Stock Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of this amendment, the Company paid to the seller $5,876,351 in cash,
and issued to the seller 2,100,000 shares of its common stock, in settlement of a minimum share price guarantee by the Company. The Company is further obligated to make an additional cash payment of $2,000,000 on March15, 2009. Deferred
payments already due under the original Stock Purchase Agreement are to be paid with 8,050,411 due on June15, 2009 and 8,303,630 due on September15, 2009. In consideration for these payments, the Company received an
additional 375 Class B shares of Whitehall, which represents an increase in the Companys economic stake from 75% to 80%. Additionally, if, during the 210 day period immediately following the effectiveness of the registration statement the
Company is obligated to file to register the shares of Company common stock obtained by the seller in this transaction, the seller sells any of the Company common stock it acquired in the transaction for an average sales price per share, weighted by
volume, that is less than $1203, per share, the Company must pay to the seller the excess, if any, of $1203 over the 
85 Table of Contents CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Amounts in tables expressed in thousands, except per share information 
volume weighted average sales price per share of the Companys common stock on the day the sale took place, multiplied by the total number of shares
sold. Finally, the Company may be obligated to make an additional cash payment to the seller, ranging from 0 to 1,500,000, based upon whether and to what extent the price of a share of the Companys common stock exceeds $1203
during that same 210 day period. If the Company must make any such payment, it will receive in return up to an additional 75 Class B shares, which represents up to an additional 1% economic stake of Whitehall, based on the sized of the payment.
As part of the Whitehall Acquisition, the Company entered into a shareholders agreement with the other shareholder pursuant to which
the Company has the right to purchase, and the other shareholder has the right to require the Company to purchase, all but not less than all of the shares of Whitehall capital stock held by such shareholder. Either of these rights may be exercised
at any time, subject, in certain circumstances, to the consent of third parties. The aggregate price that the Company would be required to pay in the event either of these rights is exercised will fall within a range, determined based on
Whitehalls EBIT as well as the EBIT of certain related businesses, during two separate periods: 1the period from January1, 2008 through the end of the year in which the right is exercised, and 2the two full financial
years immediately preceding the end of the year in which the right is exercised, plus, in each case, the time-adjusted value of any dividends paid by Whitehall. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the exercise price will be Ano less than
the future value as of the date of exercise of $320 million, and Bno more than the future value as of the date of exercise of $890 million, plus, in each case, the time-adjusted value of any dividends paid by Whitehall. On July9, 2008, the Company completed its strategic investment in Russian Alcohol Group and 1paid $1815 million for approximately 475% of
the common equity of a newly formed Cayman Islands company Cayco which indirectly acquired all of the outstanding equity of Russian Alcohol Group the Acquisition, and 2purchased $1035 million in subordinated
exchangeable loan notes the Notes issued by a subsidiary of Cayco and exchangeable into equity of Cayco. Pursuant to the shareholders agreement entered into in connection with this strategic investment, the Company has the right
to purchase, and Cayco has the right to require the Company to purchase, all but not less than all of the outstanding capital stock of a majority-owned subsidiary of Cayco Cayco Sub held by Cayco, which in either case would give the
Company indirect control over Russian Alcohol Group. The Companys right is exercisable during two 45-day periods, the first
commencing on the later of 1the date that the audited 2009 Operating Group accounts are approved by Cayco Sub and 2the date on which all earnout payments that are payable in connection with the Acquisition have been paid the
2010 Period, and the second commencing on the date that the audited 2010 Operating Group accounts are approved by Cayco Sub the 2011 Period. The Companys right may be extended after the end of the 2011 Period in a
limited circumstance to a period commencing on the date that the audited 2011 Operating Group accounts are approved by Cayco Sub the 2012 Period. If the Company exercises its right, Cayco will be obligated to exercise its drag-along
rights under the shareholders agreement governing Cayco Sub to cause the transfer to the Company, on the same terms, the remaining capital stock of Cayco Sub not held by Cayco. Caycos right will be exercisable during the 2010 Period and the
2011 Period and will expire one day after the end of the 2011 Period, and will be extended if the Companys right is extended to the 2012 Period. The price the Company would be required to pay in the event either of these rights is exercised will be equal to the adjusted equity value of Russian Alcohol Group, determined based on EBITDA multiplied by the product
of Caycos ownership percentage and 1405, 1314, or 1280, depending on when the right is exercised, less the debt of Russian Alcohol Group plus certain adjustments for cash and working capital. That price, however, in the case of the
Companys right, is subject to a floor equal to the total original euro equivalent amount based upon a exchange rate of 157 invested by the other party in Cayco multiplied by 205 in 2010 or 220 in 2009 and 
86 Table of Contents CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Amounts in tables expressed in thousands, except per share information 
converted back to U.S. dollars at the spot rate at the time, depending on when the right is exercised in either case less any dividends or distributions
actually received. Russian Alcohol Group has approximately $200 million of net indebtedness in place that, following any exercise of the Companys or Caycos rights described above, may be required to be refinanced or retired by the terms
of our other indebtedness. The Companys management currently estimates that the amount the Company would be required to pay would be between $350 million and $650 million payable in mid- 2010 if the above rights are exercised. This estimate
is based on currently available information and managements current views with respect to future events and the future financial performance of Russian Alcohol Group, as of the date hereof. These estimates, projections and views are subject to
risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from managements current estimates, projections and views, including the effects of fluctuations in currency valuations between the U.S. dollar and the Russian ruble,
and the risks and uncertainties identified in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are engaged in
discussions with Lion Capital to restructure the current agreement regarding the buyout of the remaining 58% stake in the Russian Alcohol Group, the largest spirit producer in Russia. Although the discussions are not final, and remain subject to
further legal, accounting and tax analysis, as well as board approval, we are in general agreement with Lion Capital on the main commercial objectives. We expect an agreement would include a fixed price for the remaining 58% interest in the Russian
Alcohol Group that we do not own including the conversion of our $1035 million plus accrued interest of loan notes at a valuation that is more reflective of current market conditions and the positive sales performance of the business. Our
payments would be spread out over 5 years ending in the year 2013, with smaller payments for 2009 and 2013 and more equal payments from years 2010 to 2012, and we would agree to certain security arrangements to Lion. We would not take control over
the Russian Alcohol Group until 2011, though we would receive significantly enhanced minority rights. We would expect to finance the transaction over the 5 years through a combination of cash, debt and equity. We cannot provide any assurances as to
whether, or on what terms, we may reach an agreement to restructure our arrangements in respect of the Russian Alcohol Group. In the event
that the Company is required to refinance or retire the indebtedness described above, and/or acquires the capital stock of Copecresto, Whitehall or the majority-owned subsidiary of Cayco, such transactions would be financed through additional
sources of debt or equity funding. We cannot provide assurances as to whether or on what terms such funding would be available. Operating Leases and
Rent Commitments The Company makes rental payments for real estate, vehicles, office, computer, and manufacturing equipment under
operating leases. The following is a schedule by years of the future rental payments under the non-cancelable operating lease as of December31, 2008:  2009 4,631

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company continued its policy of renewing its transportation
fleet by way of capital leases. The future minimum lease payments for the assets under capital lease as of December31, 2008 are as follows:  2009 2,385 2010 2,194 2011 Gross payments due 4,579 Less interest 366 Net payments due 4,213 Supply contracts The Company has various agreements covering its sources of supply, which, in some cases, may be terminated by either party on relatively short notice. Thus, there is a risk that a portion of the Companys supply
of products could be curtailed at any time. 15. Stockholders Equity On June25, 2008, the Company completed a public offering of 3,250,000 shares of common stock, at an offering price to the public of $6800 per share. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the offering the
underwriters exercised their over-allotment option for an additional 325,000 shares. The net proceeds from the offering, including the sale of shares in accordance with the over-allotment option, was $2338 million, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The majority of the proceeds of the equity offering were used to fund a portion of the Companys investment in the Russian Alcohol Group. 16. Interest income / expense For the twelve
months ended December31, 2008 and 2007 respectively, the following items are included in Interest income / expense:  Twelve months endedDecember31 2008 2007 Interest income 10,226 5,463 Interest expense 60,586 41,292 Total interest expense, net 50,360 35,829

Diluted earnings per share 038 191 153 As of December31, 2008, the Company excluded 657 thousand shares from the above EPS
calculation because they would have had antidilutive impact for the 2008 period presented. Employee stock options granted have been
included in the above calculations of diluted earnings per share since the exercise price is less than the average market price of the common stock during the twelve months periods ended December31, 2008 and 2007. In addition there is no
adjustment to fully diluted shares related to the Convertible Senior Notes as the average market price was below the conversion price for the period.

19. Financial Instruments Financial Instruments and Their Fair Values Financial instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, bank loans, overdraft facilities and long-term debt. The monetary assets represented by these financial instruments are primarily located in Poland, Hungary and Russia. Consequently, they are subject to currency
translation risk when reporting in U.S. Dollars. Derivative financial instruments The Company is exposed to market movements in foreign currency exchange rates that could affect the Companys results of operations and financial
condition. In accordance with SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair
value. The fair values of the Companys derivative instruments can change with fluctuations in interest rates and/orcurrency
rates and are expected to offset changes in the values of the underlying exposures. The Companys derivative instruments are held to hedge economic exposures. The Company follows internal policies to manage interest rate and foreign currency
risks, including limitations on derivative market-making or other speculative activities. To qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS
No133, the details of the hedging relationship must be formally documented at the inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risk that is being hedged, the derivative
instrument, how effectiveness is being assessed and how ineffectiveness will be measured. The derivative must be highly effective in offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows, as appropriate, of the risk being hedged. Effectiveness is evaluated on a retrospective and prospective basis based on quantitative measures. When it is determined that a derivative is not, or
has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when 1the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the
cash flows of a hedged item; 2the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; 3it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or 4management determines that designating the derivative as a
hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. Fair value hedges are hedges that offset the risk of changes in the fair values of recorded
assets, liabilities and firm commitments. The Company records changes in the fair value of derivative instruments which are designated and deemed effective as fair value hedges, in earnings offset by the corresponding changes in the fair value of
the hedged items. In September 2005, the Company entered into a coupon swap arrangement which exchanges a fixed Euro based coupon of 8 with a variable Euro based coupon IRS based upon the 6 month Euribor rate plus a margin. The hedge is accounted for as a fair value hedge according to SFAS 133 and is tested for effectiveness on a quarterly basis using the long haul method. Under
this method, as long as the hedge is deemed highly effective both the fair value of the hedge and the hedge item are marked to market with the net impact recorded as gain or loss in the income statement. For the twelve months ended December31,
2008, the company recorded a net gain of $64,026. In September 2005, the Company entered into a second hedge that exchanged the variable Euro coupon with a variable Polish Zloty coupon CIRS. However, due to the continued strength of the Polish
economy and currency the Company closed this swap contract. The hedge did not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore the changes in fair value were reflected in the results of operations. 
90 Table of Contents CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Amounts in tables expressed in thousands, except per share information 
In February 2007 and December 2006, a portion of the IRS hedge was closed and a new hedging
relationship was created. The mark to market valuation of the closed hedges at the time was frozen and is being amortized over the remaining useful life of the hedged item. The hedge closure in December 2006 was related to the part of the Senior
Secured Notes repurchased in January 2007. Consequently, the amount was written off in January 2007 following the repurchase. As of December31, 2008, there is an unamortized asset of $06 million recorded as an adjustment to the valuation of
the Senior Secured Notes. In March 2008, a portion of the IRS hedge related to the repurchased Senior Secured Notes was closed and written
off, and a new hedging relationship was created with the hedge match one for one the remaining outstanding Senior Secured Notes. In
January 2009, the remaining portion of the IRS hedge related to the Senior Secured Notes was closed and written off with a net cash settlement of approximately $19 million. 20. Fair value measurements Effective January1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No157,
which defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. SFAS No157 establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the
use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows: Level 1Quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted
prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the
assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. The Companys adoption of SFAS No157 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate the position of each financial instrument measured at fair value in the hierarchy individually based on the valuation methodology we apply. At September30, 2008, we have no material financial assets
or liabilities carried at fair value using significant level 1 or level 3 inputs and the only instruments we value using level 2 inputs are currency swap agreements as follows: Coupon Swap In September 2005, the Company entered into a coupon swap arrangement which exchanges a
fixed Euro based coupon of 8%, with a variable Euro based coupon IRS based upon the 6 month Euribor rate plus a margin. The hedge is accounted for as a fair value hedge according to SFAS 133 and is tested for effectiveness on a quarterly basis
using the long haul method. Under this method, as long as the hedge is deemed highly effective both the fair value of the hedge and the hedged item are marked to market with the net impact recorded as gain or loss in the income statement.
91 Table of Contents CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Amounts in tables expressed in thousands, except per share information 
The fair value of these instruments as at December31, 2008, was a $71 million liability, which
represented a $211 million decrease from the $282 million liability as at December31, 2007 and was recognized as a gain in the consolidated statement of operations. This gain, however, was offset by the fair value revaluation of the Senior
Secured Notes. 21. Operating segments As a result of the Companys expansion into new geographic areas, namely Russia, the Company has changed its internal management financial reporting by implementing a segmental approach to the business based upon geographic locations.
As such the Company operates in three primary segments: Poland, Russia and Hungary. The business segments reflect how the Companys operations are managed, how operating performance within the Company is evaluated by senior management and the
structure of its internal financial reporting. For detailed description of types of products and services from each reportable unit derives its revenues, refer to Operations by country section included in Part I. The Company evaluates performance based on operating income of the respective business units. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as
those described for the Company in the Summary of Significant Accounting policies in Note 1 and include the recently issued accounting pronouncement described in Note 1. Transactions between segments consist mainly of sales of products and are
accounted for at cost plus an applicable margin. The Companys areas of operations are principally in Poland Russia and Hungary.
Revenues are attributed to countries based on the location of the selling company.  Segment Net RevenuesTwelve months ended December

22. Related Party Transactions In January of 2005, the Company entered into a rental agreement for a facility located in northern Poland, which is 33% owned by the Companys Chief Operating Officer. The monthly rent to be paid by the Company
for this location is approximately $16,300 per month and relates to facilities to be shared by two subsidiaries of the Company. During the
twelve months of 2008, the Company made sales and purchases transactions with ZAO Urhozay an entity partially owned by a CEDC Board Member, Sergey Kupriyanov. Urozhay is acting as a toll filler for the Company. All sales mainly related to raw
materials for production were made on normal commercial terms, and total sales for the twelve months ended December31, 2008 were approximately $443 million. Purchases of finished goods from ZAO Urozhay were approximately $1207 million.
During the twelve months of 2008, the Company made sales to a restaurant which is partially owned by the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company. All sales were made on normal commercial terms, and total sales for the twelve months ended December31, 2008 and 2007 were approximately $73,000 and $129,000. 23. Subsequent Events On May23, 2008, the Company and certain of its affiliates, entered into,
and closed upon, a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement and certain other agreements whereby the Company acquired shares representing 50% minus one vote of the voting power, and 75% of the economic interests, in the Whitehall Group the Whitehall
Acquisition. The Whitehall Group is a leading importer of premium spirits and wines in Russia. The aggregate consideration paid by the Company was $200 million, paid in cash at the closing. In addition, on October21, 2008 the Company
issued to the Seller 843,524 shares of its common stock, par value $001 per share. On February24, 2009, the Company and the seller
amended the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement governing the Whitehall acquisition to satisfy the Companys obligations to the seller pursuant to a share price guarantee in the original Stock Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of this
amendment, the Company paid to the seller $5,876,351 in cash, and issued to the seller 2,100,000 shares of its common stock, in settlement of a minimum share price guarantee by the Company. The Company is further obligated to make an additional cash
payment of $2,000,000 on March15, 2009. Deferred payments already due under the original Stock Purchase Agreement are to be paid with 8,050,411 due on June15, 2009 and 8,303,630 due on September15, 2009. In
consideration for these payments, the Company received an additional 375 Class B shares of Whitehall, which represents an increase in the Companys economic stake from 75% to 80%. Additionally, if, during the 210 day period immediately
following the effectiveness of the registration statement the Company is obligated to file to register the shares of Company common stock obtained by the seller in this transaction, the seller sells any of the Company common stock it acquired in the
transaction for an average sales price per share, weighted by volume, that is less than $1203, per share, the Company must pay to the seller the excess, if any, of $1203 over the volume weighted average sales price per share of the Companys
common stock on the day the sale took place, multiplied by the total number of shares sold. Finally, the Company may be obligated to make an additional cash payment to the seller, ranging from 0 to 1,500,000, based upon whether and to
what extent the price of a share of the Companys common stock exceeds $1203 during that same 210 day period. If the Company must make any such payment, it will receive in return up to an additional 75 Class B shares, which represents up to an
additional 1% economic stake of Whitehall, based on the sized of the payment. In addition, in connection with the execution of the
amendment to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the parties also entered into an amendment to the Shareholders Agreement that governs the ongoing governance of Whitehall, pursuant to which the exercise price of the Companys right to require
the seller to sell, and the

sellers right to require the Company to buy, all of the capital stock of Whitehall held by the seller was increased by the time-adjusted value of any
dividends paid by Whitehall. Also on February24, 2009, the Company signed a new credit agreement for refinancing PLN 240,000,000 of
its short term debt, with substantially the same terms and conditions of the existing credit facility. The new credit agreement provides that, subject to the fulfillment of certain customary conditions, Fortis Bank Polska S.A. and Fortis Bank
S.A./NV, Austrian Branch will assign their interests as lenders under the existing credit facility to Bank Polska Kasa Opieki S.A. The new credit facility will accrue interest at an initial interest margin over the Warsaw Interbank Offer Rate of 2 an increase of 80 basis points over the existing credit facility and will extend the maturity date from March31, 2009 to February24, 2011. The Company must repay PLN 60,000,000 on August24, 2010, and PLN 180,000,000 on
February24, 2011. In order to manage the cash flow impact of foreign exchange rates, the Company has entered into certain hedge
agreements. In January 2009, the remaining portion of the IRS hedge related to the Senior Secured Notes was closed and written off with a net cash settlement of approximately $19 million. We are engaged in discussions with Lion Capital to restructure the current agreement regarding the buyout of the remaining 58% stake in the Russian
Alcohol Group, the largest spirit producer in Russia. Although the discussions are not final, and remain subject to further legal, accounting and tax analysis, as well as board approval, we are in general agreement with Lion Capital on the main
commercial objectives. We expect an agreement would include a fixed price for the remaining 58% interest in the Russian Alcohol Group that we do not own including the conversion of our $1035 million plus accrued interest of loan notes at a
valuation that is more reflective of current market conditions and the positive sales performance of the business. Our payments would be spread out over 5 years ending in the year 2013, with smaller payments for 2009 and 2013 and more equal payments
from years 2010 to 2012, and we would agree to certain security arrangements to Lion. We would not take control over the Russian Alcohol Group until 2011, though we would receive significantly enhanced minority rights. We would expect to finance the
transaction over the 5 years through a combination of cash, debt and equity. We cannot provide any assurances as to whether, or on what terms, we may reach an agreement to restructure our arrangements in respect of the Russian Alcohol Group.

Control and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and
Procedures.Disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 refer to the controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Managements Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting.The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f and Rule 15d-15f of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. The Companys management has excluded the Parliament Group and the Whitehall
Group from its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, because these companies were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during the year ended December31, 2008. The Parliament
Group is a subsidiary of the Company that is controlled by ownership of a majority voting interest, whose total assets and total revenues represent 910% and 788%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statements as of and for the
year ended December31, 2008. With respect to the Whitehall Group, the Company acquired shares representing 50% minus one vote of the voting power, and 75% of the economic interest. Total assets and total revenues of the Whitehall Group
represent 907% and 1021%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December31, 2008. Based on its assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2008. Based upon the evaluation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the
Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Inherent Limitations in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting.The Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over
financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, 
97 Table of Contents CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Amounts in tables expressed in thousands, except per share information 
no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of
the limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Further, the design of any control system is based in
part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of these inherent limitations in a
cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Accordingly, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the controls and procedures will
meet their objectives. Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting.The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer conclude that, during the most recent fiscal quarter, there have been no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Companys internal controls over financial reporting.
