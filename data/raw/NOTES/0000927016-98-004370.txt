1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
NATURE OF BUSINESS
Brooks Automation, Inc. the Company is an independent supplier of
material handling robots, modules, real-time software and controls, fully
integrated cluster tool platforms and manufacturing execution systems
MES software to semiconductor, flat panel display, and data storage
manufacturers worldwide. Founded in 1978, the Company has distinguished
itself as a technology and market leader, particularly in the demanding
cluster-tool vacuum-processing environment. In fiscal 1996 the Company
acquired Techware Systems Corporation Techware, which designs and
supplies integrated equipment control software for the semiconductor and
related industries. In 1998 the Company acquired FASTech Integration, Inc.
FASTech, which designs, develops, markets, and supports an integrated
suite of MES workflow software products for the semiconductor, electronics,
and general discrete manufacturing industries.
SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. The acquisitions of Techware and FASTech
have been accounted for as poolings of interests, and the accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been restated to include the
financial position and results of operations of Techware and FASTech for all
periods prior to the acquisitions. See Note 2.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from product sales and software license sales is recorded upon
shipment to the customer provided that no significant obligations remain and
collection of the related receivable is probable. When insignificant
obligations remain after shipment of the product, the Company accrues the
estimated costs of such obligations upon shipment. A provision for product
warranty costs is recorded at the time of sale. In the event significant
post-shipment obligations or uncertainties remain, revenue is deferred and
recognized when such obligations are fulfilled by the Company or the
uncertainties are resolved.
Revenue from services is recognized as the services are rendered. Revenue
from fixed fee application consulting contracts is recognized using the
percentage-of-completion method of contract accounting based on the ratio
that costs incurred to date bear to estimated total costs at completion.
Revisions in revenue and cost estimates are recorded in the periods in
which the facts that require such revisions become known. Losses, if any,
are provided for in the period in which such losses are first identified by
management. For maintenance contracts, service revenue is recognized ratably
over the term of the maintenance contract.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company invests its excess cash in repurchase agreements with major
banks, U. S. government securities, and mutual funds that invest in U.S.
government securities, which are subject to minimal credit and market risk.
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At
September 30, 1998, cash and cash equivalents include $443 million and
$239 million of securities which are classified as available-for-sale and
held to maturity, respectively, and for which cost approximates fair value.
At September 30, 1997, cash and cash equivalents include $441 million and
$312 million of securities which are classified as available-for-sale and
held to maturity, respectively, and for which cost approximates fair value.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined
using the first-in, first-out method. The Company provides inventory
reserves for excess, obsolete, or damaged inventory based on changes in
customer demand, technology, and other economic factors. While the Company
often uses sole source suppliers for certain key components
32
BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
and common assemblies to achieve quality control and the benefits of
economies of scale, the Company believes that these parts and materials are
readily available from several supply sources.
FIXED ASSETS
Fixed assets are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated
useful lives which range from 3 to 5 years for computer equipment and
software, 5 to 7 years for machinery and equipment, and 3 to 10 years for
furniture and fixtures using the straight-line method. Equipment held under
capital leases is recorded at the lower of the fair market value of the
equipment or the present value of the minimum lease payments at the
inception of the leases. Leasehold improvements and equipment held under
capital leases are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful
lives or the term of the respective leases. Repair and maintenance costs are
expensed as incurred.
PATENTS
The Company capitalizes the direct costs associated with obtaining patents.
Capitalized patent costs are amortized using the straight-line method over
the shorter of seven years or the estimated economic life of the patents.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Costs incurred in the research and development of the Company products are
expensed as incurred, except for certain software development costs.
Software development costs are expensed prior to establishing technological
feasibility and capitalized thereafter until the related product is
available for general release to customers. Capitalized software development
costs are amortized to cost of sales on a product-by-product basis over the
estimated lives of the related products.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company stock compensation plans are accounted for in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. Under this method, compensation expense on stock option grants
to employees for a fixed number of shares is recognized only to the extent
that the exercise price on the date of grant is less than the current fair
market value of the Company common stock. The Company has adopted the
disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, for fixed 
stock-based awards to employees. All non-employee stock-based awards are
accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 123.
INCOME TAXES
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected
future tax consequences, utilizing current tax rates, of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and
liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recognized, net of any valuation
allowance, for the estimated future tax effects of deductible temporary
differences and tax operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred income
tax expense or benefit represents the change in the net deferred tax asset
and liability balances.
FOREIGN CURRENCY
The functional currency of the Company international subsidiaries is the
local currency. Accordingly, foreign currency financial statements of the
Company international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using
exchange rates in effect at period-end for assets and liabilities and at
average rates during the period for results of operations. The resulting
foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected as a separate
component of consolidated other stockholders' equity.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share has been calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 128,
Earnings per Share, which was adopted as required in fiscal 1998. All
previously reported earnings per share data presented herein have been
restated. Basic earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of
common shares and dilutive common equivalent shares assumed outstanding
during the period. Shares used to compute diluted earnings per share in loss
years exclude common share equivalents, as their inclusion would have an
anti-dilutive effect.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, and SFAS No. 131, Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 130
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and
its components in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 131
establishes standards for reporting information on operating segments in
interim and annual financial statements. Both statements are effective for
the Company for fiscal 1999. Adoption of these statements will not have any
effects on the Company results of operations or financial position.
In October 1997 the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition,
which provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles
in recognizing revenue on software transactions and supersedes SOP 91-1,
Software Revenue Recognition. The Company will adopt SOP 97-2 effective
October 1, 1998. Adoption of this statement will not have a material impact
on the Company results of operations or financial position.
In June 1998 the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement is effective for all
fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999 fiscal
2000 for the Company and requires that all derivative instruments be
recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value
of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as
part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction.
Management of the Company anticipates that the adoption of SFAS No. 133 will
not have a significant effect on the Company results of operations or
financial position.
2. ACQUISITIONS
In September 1998 the Company acquired FASTech and issued 852,428 shares of
common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding common and preferred
shares of FASTech. In connection with this acquisition, the Company incurred
$24 million of costs, consisting primarily of transaction costs to effect
the acquisition and costs to exit duplicate facilities. See Note 14. As a
result of conforming dissimilar year-ends, FASTech results of operations
for the year ended December 31, 1997, have been combined with the Company
results of operations for the year ended September 30, 1997. The results of
operations for fiscal 1998 are for the twelve months ended September 30,
1998, for both the Company and FASTech. FASTech unaudited results of
operations for the three months ended December 31, 1997, including
revenues, operating loss, and net loss of $50 million, $10 million, and
$28 million, respectively are included in the consolidated statement of
operations for both the fiscal years ended September 30, 1998 and 1997.
Therefore, an amount equal to FASTech net loss for the three months ended
December 31, 1997, was eliminated from consolidated retained earnings for
the year ended September 30, 1998.
Revenue and net income for the previously separate companies are as follows                   unaudited

BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  In February 1996 the Company acquired Techware Systems Corporation
Techware and issued 462,189 shares of common stock in exchange for all the
outstanding shares of Techware. In connection with this acquisition, the
Company incurred expenses of $230,000, consisting primarily of transaction
costs to effect the acquisition.  As a result of conforming dissimilar year-
ends, Techware results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1995,
have been combined with the Company results of operations for the year ended
September 30, 1995. The results of operations for fiscal 1996 are for the
twelve months ended September 30, 1996, for both the Company and Techware.
Techware unaudited results of operations for the three months ended December
31, 1995, including revenues and net income of $18 million and $01
million, respectively are included in the consolidated statement of
operations for both the fiscal years ended September 30, 1996 and 1995.
Therefore, an amount equal to Techware net income for the three months ended
December 31, 1995, was eliminated from consolidated retained earnings for the
year ended September 30, 1996.
Both of the above acquisitions were accounted for as poolings of interests,
and the Company Consolidated Financial Statements have been restated to
include the financial position and results of operations of FASTech and
Techware for all periods prior to the acquisitions.

During fiscal 1998, the Company elected to terminate its primary domestic and
international credit facilities. There were no borrowings outstanding under 
these credit facilities at September 30, 1998.
In July 1997 the Company issued $25 million of subordinated notes with
attached warrants to certain stockholders that were due June 30, 2004. The
Company was required to make quarterly interest payments on the subordinated
notes at the rate of 9% per year. In connection with the issuance of the
subordinated notes and warrants, the Company recorded a discount on the
subordinated notes of $420,000 to reflect the value of the warrants, as
determined by use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The outstanding
balance of the note was repaid and the remaining discount of $03 million was
expensed at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 in conjunction with the
acquisition of FASTech. See Note 2.

$10,366  $10,081
Redeemable convertible preferred stockholders were entitled to the number of
votes equal to the number of shares of common stock that each share of
redeemable preferred stock was convertible. The redeemable preferred stock was
convertible into common stock at the option of the stockholder based upon a
conversion rate as defined by the related agreement. In the event of a public
offering of the Company common stock resulting in gross proceeds of at least
$10 million, the redeemable preferred stock would have converted into common
stock upon the effective date of the registration statement. Dividends were
cumulative and accrued at the rate of $028, $016, $014, and $0128 per share
on the Series D, Series C, Series B, and Series A redeemable convertible
preferred stock, respectively. On the earlier of June 30, 2004, or the repayment
of the subordinated note described in Note 5, the Company would have been
required to redeem the redeemable convertible preferred stock.
8. NONREDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK, COMMON STOCK, AND OTHER STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY
PREFERRED STOCK
As of September 30, 1998 and 1997, there were 1 million shares of preferred
stock, $001 par value per share authorized; but none were issued or
outstanding. Preferred stock may be issued at the discretion of the Board of
Directors without stockholder approval with such designations, rights, and
preferences as the Board of Directors may determine.
SERIES E CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
The Series E convertible preferred stock was converted into the Company common
stock on September 30, 1998, in conjunction with the FASTech acquisition by the
Company see Note 2. Series E convertible preferred stockholders were entitled
to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which
each share of Series E preferred stock was convertible. The Series E preferred
stock was convertible into common stock at the option of the stockholder based
upon a conversion rate as defined by the related agreement. In the event of a
public offering of the Company common stock resulting in gross proceeds of at
least $10 million, the Series E preferred stock would have converted into common
stock upon the effective date of the registration statement. In the event of
liquidation of the Company, holders of Series E convertible preferred stock were
entitled to receive, in preference to any distribution to the common
stockholders, $350 per share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, plus any
accrued but unpaid dividends.

1995 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
On February 22, 1996, the stockholders approved the 1995 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan the 1995 Plan which enables eligible employees to purchase shares of
the Company common stock. Under the 1995 Plan, eligible employees may purchase
up to an aggregate of 150,000 shares during six-month offering periods
commencing on January 1 and July 1 of each year at a price per share of 85% of
the lower of the market price per share on the first or last day of each six-
month offering period. Participating employees may elect to have up to 10% of
base pay withheld and applied toward the purchase of such shares. The rights of
participating employees under the 1995 Plan terminate upon voluntary withdrawal
from the plan at any time or upon termination of employment. As of September 30,
1998, the Company has reserved 40,279 shares of common stock for issuance under
the 1995 Plan.
1992 COMBINATION STOCK OPTION PLAN
The 1992 Combination Stock Option Plan the 1992 Plan allows for the grant of
non-qualified and incentive stock options for the purchase of up to 1,550,000
shares of the Company common stock, net of cancellations, by employees,
directors or consultants who provide services to the Company. The Board of
Directors of the Company is responsible for administration of the 1992 Plan.
Stock options granted under the plan have generally been granted at exercise
prices, as determined by the Board of Directors, of not less than the fair value
per common share on the date of the grant. Both non-qualified and incentive
stock options are exercisable at various dates as determined by the Board of
Directors. Incentive stock options are exercisable either within 10 years of the
date of grant or within 5 years of the date of grant for employees holding
greater than 10% of the Company voting stock.

1993 NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION PLAN
The 1993 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan the Director Plan allows
for the issuance of stock options to directors who provide services to the
Company. In fiscal 1997, the Company stockholders approved an increase in the
number of shares issuable under the Director Plan from 90,000 to 190,000 shares.
The price of the stock options is determined by the Board of Directors and are
priced at not less than the fair market value on the date of grant. Options vest
over a five year period.
On July 25, 1996, the Board of Directors determined that certain stock options
issued to employees of the Company had an exercise price significantly higher
than the fair market value of the Company common stock. In light of the
Board conclusions that such options were not providing the desired incentive,
the Board provided employees with the opportunity to exchange options previously
granted to them under the 1992 Plan for new options the Replacement Options
to purchase the same number of shares of common stock at an exercise price of
$1100 per share, the then fair market value of the Company common stock.
Employees were given the choice of retaining their existing options, with the
original vesting schedule, or accepting the Replacement Options, with a vesting
schedule commencing on July 25, 1996. The Company canceled and replaced options
to purchase 344,600 shares of common stock with an average exercise price of
$1436 per share.
STOCK OPTIONS OF ACQUIRED COMPANY
In connection with the FASTech acquisition, the Company assumed 80,351 options
in September 1998. These assumed options were granted at prices equal to the
fair value at the date of grant, become exercisable in installments generally
ratably over five years, and expire ten years from the date of grant. The
Company does not intend to issue any additional options under the FASTech stock
option plans.
Aggregate stock option activity for all plans for the two years ended 
September 30, 1998 and 1997, is as follows                      SEPTEMBER 30, 1998       SEPTEMBER 30 ,1997      SEPTEMBER 30, 1996

made during fiscal 1998, fiscal 1997, and fiscal 1996: No dividend yield, risk
free interest rates of 55% to 63%, expected option term of four years,
expected forfeiture rate of 25%, and a volatility factor of 100%. The following

common stock purchased pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
consistent with the methods prescribed by SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effect

RIGHTS DISTRIBUTION
In July 1997, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of one preferred share
purchase right a right for each share of common stock outstanding on
August 12, 1997. Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase 
41
BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
from the Company, upon certain triggering events, one one-thousandth of a share
of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $001 per share the
Series A Preferred Shares, of the Company, at a purchase price of $135 per
one one-thousandth of a Series A Preferred Share, subject to adjustment.
Redemption of the rights could generally discourage a merger or tender offer
involving the securities of the Company that is not approved by the Company
Board of Directors by increasing the cost of effecting any such transaction and,
accordingly, could have an adverse impact on stockholders who might want to vote
in favor of such merger or participate in such tender offer. The rights will
expire on the earlier of i July 31, 2007, or ii the date on which the rights
are redeemed. The terms of the rights may generally be amended by the Board of
Directors without the consent of the holders of the rights.
11. BENEFIT PLAN
The Company sponsors defined contribution plans that meets the requirements of
Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. All domestic employees of the
Company who meet minimum age and service requirements are eligible to
participate in the plan. The plan allows employees to invest on a pre-tax basis
a percentage of their annual salary subject to statutory limitations. The
Company contribution expense was $02 million, $02 million, and $01 million
in fiscal 1998, fiscal 1997, and fiscal 1996, respectively.
12. GEOGRAPHIC, SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS, AND RELATED PARTY INFORMATION
Net revenues by geographic area are as follows in thousands                 For the year ended September 30, 
1998         1997         1996
North America   $58,613   59%   $ 67,484   62%   $ 84,536   75%
Asia        31,679   32%    33,304   31%    19,315   17%
Europe       9,570   9%    7,953   7%    8,879   8%
$99,862  100%   $108,741  100%   $112,730  100%
One of the Company Directors is an executive with one of the Company
customers. Net revenue recognized from this customer was $159 million, $182
million, and $191 million in fiscal 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively. Amounts
due from this customer included in accounts receivable at September 30, 1998 and
1997, were $24 million and $53 million, respectively. Related party amounts
included in accounts receivable are on standard terms and manner of settlement.
The Company did not have any other single customer that accounted for more than
10% of the Company net revenues in fiscal 1998, fiscal 1997, and fiscal 1996.
A financial instrument which potentially exposes the Company to concentration of
credit risk is accounts receivable, as the Company customers are concentrated
in the semiconductor industry and relatively few customers account for a
significant portion of the Company revenues. At September 30, 1998 and 1997,
three customers accounted for approximately 34% and 39%, respectively, of
accounts receivable. The Company regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its
customers and believes that it has adequately provided for exposure to potential
credit losses.
13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCY
Lease Commitments
The Company leases manufacturing and office facilities and certain equipment
under operating and capital leases Notes 4 and 5 that expire through 2003.
Rent expense under operating leases for fiscal 1998, fiscal 1997, and fiscal
1996 was $46 million, $32 million, and $25 million, respectively. Future
minimum lease payments under operating and capital leases with initial or
remaining noncancelable terms of one or more years are as follows as of
September 30, 1998 in thousands                    42

CONTINGENCY
There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual
property rights in the semiconductor and related industries. The Company has
received notice from a third-party alleging infringements of such party patent
rights by certain of the Company products. The Company patent counsel is
investigating the claim and the Company believes the patents claimed may be
invalid. In the event of litigation with respect to this claim, the Company is
prepared to vigorously defend its position. However, because patent litigation
can be extremely expensive and time consuming, the Company may seek to obtain a
license to one or more of the disputed patents. Based upon currently available
information, the Company would only do so if such license fees would not be
material to the Company consolidated financial statements. Currently, the
Company does not believe that it is probable that future events related to this
threatened matter will have an adverse effect on the Company business.
14. RESTRUCTURING COSTS
During fiscal year 1998, the Company approved and implemented a restructuring 
program designed to align the Company cost structure with lower revenue levels
indicative of the recent decline in demand for semiconductor equipment. These 
actions involved approximately 120 employees, all of whom were terminated prior 
to September 30, 1998. Accordingly, during fiscal 1998, the Company recorded a
charge of $13 million related to the restructuring program, primarily for
employee severance costs. No significant amount remained accrued at September
30, 1998.
In addition, the Company recorded charges of $14 million in connection with its
acquisition of FASTech see Note 2, reflecting estimated costs to exit
duplicate facilities. This amount is primarily comprised of estimated lease
costs on FASTech former headquarters facility and was included in accrued
expenses at September 30, 1998.
