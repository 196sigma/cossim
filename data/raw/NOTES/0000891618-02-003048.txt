REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors IXYS Corporation In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of IXYS Corporation and its subsidiaries at March31, 2002 and 2001,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years ended March31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of IXYS management; our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

1.FORMATION AND BUSINESS OF IXYS IXYS Corporation
IXYS or the Registrant designs, develops and markets power semiconductors,
digital and analog Integrated Circuits ICs, and high speed, high density
Static Random Access Memory SRAM. Power semiconductors are used primarily in
controlling energy in motor drives, power conversion including uninterruptible
power supplies UPSand switch mode power supplies SMPS and medical
electronics. IXYS power semiconductors convert electricity at relatively high
voltage and current levels to create efficient power as required by a specific
application. IXYS target market includes segments of the power semiconductor
market that require medium to high power semiconductors, with a particular
emphasis on higher power semiconductors. IXYS sells power semiconductors,
including power MOSFETs, insulated gate bipolar transistors IGBTs, thyristors
silicon controlled rectifiers or SCRs and rectifiers, including fast
recovery epitaxial diodes FREDs. SRAM products are for uses in
telecommunication devices, workstations and high performance PCs to OEMs and
distributors in the United States, Europe and the Far East. 2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of IXYS and its
wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of all significant intercompany
balances and transactions. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from IXYS estimates. Foreign Currency Translation The local currency is considered to be the functional currency of IXYS
wholly owned subsidiaries, IXYS Semiconductor GmbH IXYS GmbH, IXYS CH GmbH
IXYS CH, IXYS Berlin GmbH IXYS Berlin and Westcode Semiconductors
Limited Westcode. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated at the
exchange rate in effect at year-end and revenues and expenses are translated at
average rates during the year. Adjustments resulting from the translation of
the accounts of IXYS GmbH, IXYS CH, IXYS Berlin and Westcode into U.S. dollars
are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of
stockholders equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are
included as a component of non-operating income and expense. Cash Equivalents IXYS considers all highly liquid investments with original or remaining
maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash
equivalents. 43. Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years consolidated
financial statements to conform to the current years presentation. Such
reclassifications had no effect on previously reported results of operations or
retained earnings. Inventories Inventories, consisting primarily of bipolar devices, transistors, diodes
and integrated circuits for furnished goods and wafers, are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost
is determined on a standard cost basis which approximates actual costs
determined on a first-in, first-out FIFOmethod. Plant and Equipment Plant and equipment, including equipment under capital leases, is stated
at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation or
amortization is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful
lives of three to five years for equipment and twenty years for buildings. Upon
disposal, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from
IXYS accounts and the resulting gains or losses are reflected in the
statements of operations. IXYS policy is to regularly review the carrying
value of specialized assets to evaluate the remaining life and recoverability
of such equipment in light of current market conditions. Impairment of Long
Lived Assets IXYS reviews long
lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable, or whenever management has committed to a plan to dispose of
the assets. Such assets are carried at the lower of depreciated cost or fair
market value as estimated by management based on appraisals, current market
value, and comparable sales value, as appropriate. Recoverability of an asset
is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future
undiscounted net cash flows that
the asset is expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the
carrying amount of the assets exceeds the projected discounted future cash
flows arising from the assets. Revenue Recognition Revenue from power semiconductor product sales is recognized upon
shipment, provided that a customer signed purchase order was
received, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection of
resulting receivables is reasonably assured, and there are no
remaining significant obligations. Reserves for sales returns and
allowances, including allowances for so called ship and
debit transactions, are recorded at
the time of shipment, based on historical returns discounts, current
economic trends and changes in customer demand. Reserves for
warranties are recorded at the time of shipment for amounts necessary
to replace or repair products during the warranty period, which is
generally one year. Advertising IXYS expenses advertising as the costs are incurred. Advertising expense
for the years ended March31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $299,000, $379,000 and
$392,000, respectively. Research and Development Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred. 44. Table of Contents
IXYS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
Income Taxes IXYS provision for income taxes is comprised of its current tax liability
and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and
tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax
rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to
reverse. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense primarily consists of legal expenses, gains and
losses on foreign currency transactions and gains and losses on sales of fixed
assets. Net Income Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted- average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
earnings per share reflects the potential dilution from the exercise or
conversion of options or other securities into common stock. Diluted net income
per share for fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000 do not include the effect of
207,800, 178,300, and 704,894 common equivalent shares, respectively, because their effect
would have been anti-dilutive. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No141, Business Combinations SFAS No141
and Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets SFAS No142. SFAS No141 requires the purchase method of
accounting to be used for all business combinations initiated after June30,
2001. SFAS No141 also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired must
meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. The adoption of
SFAS No141 will not have a material effect on IXYS results of operations or
financial position. SFAS No142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
lives no longer be amortized but instead be measured for impairment at least
annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. IXYS adoption
date will be April1, 2002. As of that date, amortization of goodwill and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets, including those recorded in past business
combinations, will cease. As a result of the elimination of this amortization,
other expense will decrease by approximately $232,000 annually for goodwill
currently recognized. As required by SFAS No142, IXYS will perform impairment tests on
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of the adoption date.
Thereafter, IXYS will perform impairment tests annually and whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived
intangible assets might be impaired. In connection with the SFAS No142
transitional goodwill impairment test, IXYS will utilize the required two-step
method for determining goodwill impairment as of the adoption date. To
accomplish this, it will identify its reporting units and determine the
carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities,
including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units
as of the adoption date. IXYS will then have up to six months from the adoption
date to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the
carrying amount of the reporting unit. To the extent the carrying amount of a
reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, IXYS will then
perform the second step of the transitional impairment test. If necessary, in
the second step, IXYS will compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit
goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill, both of which
would be measured as of the adoption date. The implied fair value of goodwill
will be determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of
the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit
in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with SFAS No.
141. The residual fair value after this allocation will be the implied fair
value of the reporting unit goodwill. IXYS will record a transitional
impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill allocated to
the reporting unit over the implied fair value. SFAS No142 requires that this
second step be completed as soon as possible, but no later than the end of the
year of adoption. In connection with the SFAS No142 indefinite-lived intangible asset
impairment test, IXYS will utilize the required one-step method to determine
whether an impairment exists as of the adoption date. The test will consist of
a comparison of the fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets with the
carrying amounts. If the carrying 45. Table of Contents
IXYS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value,
IXYS will recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess. IXYS has not yet determined the impact of the provisions of the impairment
test under SFAS No142 on its results of operations and financial position;
management does expect the adoption of SFASNo. 142 to have a
material impact on its financial position and results of operations.
In October 2001, FASB issued SFAS No144, Accounting for Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December15, 2001 and interim periods within those fiscal periods. SFAS
No144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of
certain long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of. SFAS No.
144 supersedes SFAS No121 Accounting for the Impairment
of long-lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of
and Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No30; however, SFAS No144
retains the requirement of APB Opinion No30 to report discontinued operations
separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component
of an entity that has either been disposed of by sale, abandonment or in a
distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale. IXYS does not expect
the adoption of SFAS No144 to have a material impact on its financial
position and results of operations. Comprehensive Income IXYS adopted SFAS No130, Accounting for Comprehensive Income, during
the fiscal year ended 1998. This statement establishes standards for reporting
and display of comprehensive income and its components including revenues,
expenses, gains and losses in a full set of general-purpose financial
statements. IXYS change in the cumulative translation adjustment represent the
only component of comprehensive income which is excluded from net income for
2002 and prior years.
Business Risks Dependence on Third Parties for Wafer Fabrication and Assembly IXYS manufactures approximately 56% of its wafers, an integral component
of its products, in its wholly owned facility in Germany. There can be no assurance
that material disruptions in supply will not occur in the future. In such
event, IXYS may have to identify and secure additional foundry capacity and may
be unable to identify or secure additional foundry capacity from another
manufacturer, particularly at the levels that IXYS currently anticipates such
foundries to provide. Even if such capacity is available from another
manufacturer, the qualification process could take six months or longer. If
IXYS were unable to qualify alternative manufacturing sources for existing or
new products in a timely manner or if such sources were unable to produce
semiconductor devices with acceptable manufacturing yields and at acceptable
prices, IXYS business, financial condition and results of operations would be
materially and adversely affected. Dependence on Suppliers IXYS purchases silicon wafers from three vendors with whom IXYS does not
have long term supply agreements. Any of these suppliers could eliminate or
terminate IXYS supply of wafers at any time. IXYS reliance on a limited
number of suppliers involves several risks, including potential inability to
obtain an adequate supply of silicon wafers and reduced control over the price,
timely delivery, reliability and quality of the silicon wafers. There can be no
assurance that problems will not occur in the future with suppliers. Concentration of Credit Risk IXYS invests its excess cash primarily in short-term time deposit accounts
with a major German bank and money market accounts with a U.S. bank.
Additionally, IXYS invests in commercial paper with financial institutions
that management believes to be creditworthy. These securities mature
within ninety days or less and bear minimal credit risk. IXYS has not
experienced any losses on such investments. 46. Table of Contents
IXYS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
IXYS sells its products primarily to distributors and original equipment
manufacturers. IXYS performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
generally does not require collateral. An allowance for potential credit losses
is maintained by IXYS and such losses have not been material. At March31, 2002, no customer accounted for greater than 10% of accounts
receivable. At March31, 2001, one customer accounted for 13% of accounts
receivable. Financial instruments that potentially subject IXYS to concentrations of
credit risks comprise principally cash, investments and trade accounts
receivable. IXYS invests its excess cash in accordance with its investment
policy that has been approved by the Board of Directors and is reviewed
periodically to minimize credit risk. The policy authorizes the investment of
excess cash in government securities, tax exempt municipal securities,
Eurodollar notes and bonds, time deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial
paper rated Aa or better and other specific money market accounts and corporate
instruments of similar liquidity and credit quality. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Carrying amounts of certain of IXYS financial instruments including cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair
value due to their short maturities. Based on borrowing rates currently
available to IXYS for loans with similar terms, the carrying value of
notes and loans payable to bank and notes receivable from shareholders approximate fair value. Stock-Based Compensation Plans IXYS accounts for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value
method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board APB OpinionNo25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under APB No25, compensation cost
is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of IXYS stock at
the date of grant over the exercise price of the option granted. Compensation
cost for stock options, if any, is recognized ratably over the vesting period.
IXYS policy is to grant options with an exercise price equal to the quoted
market price of IXYS stock on the grant date. Accordingly, no compensation has
been recognized for its stock option plans. IXYS provides additional pro forma
disclosures as required under SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. 3.ACQUISITIONS
Westcode Semiconductors Limited On January22, 2002, IXYS completed the acquisition of Westcode
Semiconductor Limited Westcode, a power semiconductor manufacturer based in
the United Kingdom. Westcode manufactures high voltage power semiconductors.
The primary reason for IXYS acquiring Westcode was to provide IXYS with access
to higher voltage market segments especially in Europe and to acquire a skilled
manufacturing workforce. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase
with a total cost of $9,260,000, which consisted of cash
consideration of $9,000,000
and $260,000 of direct transaction costs. In connection with the acquisition, IXYS
has also assumed liabilities of $6,039,000. Westcodes results of operations are
included in the financial statements from the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets acquired were not material. The assets
and liabilities acquired were recorded based on their fair values as of the
date of acquisition. The total purchase price and the purchase price allocation of the Westcode
acquisition were as follows in thousands

Directed Energy, Inc. On May16, 2000, IXYS completed the acquisition of Directed Energy, Inc.
in a stock-for-stock acquisition. In connection with the acquisition, IXYS
issued 250,370 shares of IXYS common stock in exchange for all the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Directed Energy, Inc. The shares issued in the
transaction reflect a total purchase price of $28million. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting,
and accordingly, the recognized purchase price of $28million was allocated to
the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed on the basis of their fair values on the acquisition date of May16,
2000. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of identified tangible and
intangible assets and liabilities assumed in the amount of $232million was
allocated to goodwill and it is being amortized over its estimated useful life
of 10years. The effects of the acquisition on IXYS financial statements are
not material. 4.BALANCE SHEET DETAILS

5.BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS IXYS entered into a loan and security agreement with a U.S. bank to borrow
up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $50million. The loan bears interest
at the banks prime rate 45% at March31, 2002, payable monthly, and matures
in September 2002. The loan is collateralized by certain assets and contains
certain general and financial 50. Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
covenants, including a requirement that IXYS remain solvent and able to
pay its debts as they become due. At March31, 2002, IXYS has drawn $700,000
against the loan. IXYS has another line of credit with a U.S. bank that
consists of a $100,000 commitment, which is available through
September 2002.
The line bears interest at a fixed rate of 95%. The line is collateralized by
a $100,000 certificate of deposit that we have with the bank. At March31,
2002, there were no amounts being drawn down against such line of credit. In Germany, at March31, 2001, IXYS had a $50million line of credit with
a German bank with no outstanding balance. This line supports a letter of
credit facility. In July 2000, a German bank issued to IXYS a commitment letter
for a DM 75million equipment lease facility. IXYS existing equipment leases,
DM 30million at March31, 2002, were charged against the facility. The
equipment leases provide financing at varying pricing for periods up to 48
months. In addition to the rights to the equipment, the bank holds a security
interest in other assets and up to DM 10million deposited with the bank. In July 2000, in the same commitment letter discussed above, the bank also
committed to issue a credit line to IXYS up to DM 99million for a wafer
fabrication facility in Germany, including leasehold improvements, clean room
construction and fabrication, computer and office equipment. At
March31, 2002,
IXYS had drawn DM 676,000 under this commitment. The security interest of the
bank under the equipment lease facility also collateralizes this line. In December 2001,
IXYS entered into a term loan with a Swiss bank in the amount of
SFR200,000. The loan bears interest of 525% and is due in
November 2006. 6.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments IXYS leases certain equipment under capital lease arrangements expiring
through fiscal year 2002 at interest rates of 65% to 102%. IXYS rents certain of its facilities under operating leases which expire
in 2004. IXYS is responsible for insurance and property taxes. Future minimum lease payment under capital and operating leases are in

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
As of March31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, IXYS had cash deposits with a
financial institution of $205,000, $387,000 and $304,000, respectively, which
were restricted as to use and represent compensating balances for current or
future discounted acceptances and letters of credit which is included
in restricted cash on the Company balance sheets. As of March31, 2002, IXYS is committed to purchase $168million of
inventory from a supplier of IXYS. On September22, 2000, IXYS Corporation entered into a guaranty for $50
million in favor of Commerzbank AG to obtain a line of credit granted by
Commerzbank AG to IXYS Semiconductor GmbH. At March31, 2002, the line of
credit was $50million. Legal Proceedings
On June22, 2000, International Rectifier Corporation filed an action for
patent infringement against IXYS in the United States District Court for the
Central District of California, alleging that certain of IXYS products sold in
the United States infringe U.S. patents owned by International Rectifier.
International Rectifiers complaint against IXYS contends that IXYS alleged
infringement of International Rectifiers patents has been and continues to be
willful and deliberate. The complaint seeks to enjoin IXYS from further
infringement and requests an award of actual monetary damages on sales of
products that are claimed to infringe International Rectifiers patents.
International Rectifier also seeks to have the damages trebled. IXYS answered the complaint, denying any infringement and asserting that
the International Rectifier patents are invalid and unenforceable for, among
other reasons, failure of International Rectifier to properly disclose known
prior art during its prosecution of the patents in suit. IXYS also contended
that International Rectifiers claims are barred by reason of the doctrines of
estoppel and laches. Trial in this case had been originally scheduled for June12,
2001; however, the U.S. District Court has repeatedly continued the trial
date, which is currently set for July30, 2002. The U.S. District Court has also granted motions for summary adjudication
dismissing all of IXYS affirmative defenses and decided that certain of IXYS
power MOSFETs and IGBTs infringe certain claims of each of International
Rectifiers U.S. patents 4,959,699, 5,008,725 and/or 5,130,767. International Rectifier also contends that IXYS importation into the
United States of certain IXYS-designed MOSFET products manufactured for IXYS by
Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. Samsung is in violation of a consent decree
and injunction entered against Samsung in another lawsuit to which IXYS was not
a party the Samsung Injunction. In February 2001, International Rectifier
served Samsung and IXYS with a Post-Judgment Ex Parte Application for Order to
Show Cause Re Contempt seeking, among other things, an enforcement of the
Samsung Injunction enjoining IXYS importation into the United States of the
allegedly-infringing products, and an appropriate fine. IXYS responded by
filing a motion requesting clarification of the Samsung Injunction, or if the
Samsung Injunction is construed to cover IXYS products, modification of the
Samsung Injunction to exclude IXYS devices. Argument concerning the Order to
Show Cause was held in May 2001, at which time the U.S. District Court remarked
that IXYS was bound by the Samsung Injunction, and that IXYS and Samsung were
attempting to subvert the Samsung Injunction by having IXYS take delivery
outside the United States of the allegedly-infringing products. At that time,
the U.S. District Court deferred a decision as to whether IXYS and Samsung were
in contempt. In March 2002, no decision having been reached on its earlier
motion, IXYS renewed and amended its motion to clarify, modify or vacate the
Samsung Injunction as to IXYS devices. On March19, 2002, the U.S. District
Court adopted and entered Interim Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law that
decided, among other things, that IXYS is bound by, and IXYS devices are not
excepted from, the Samsung Injunction. On April1, 2002, the U.S. District
Court denied IXYS renewed motion to clarify, modify or vacate the Samsung
Injunction. IXYS immediately appealed each of these rulings to the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit and requested a stay of 52. Table of Contents
IXYS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
the Samsung Injunction as to IXYS devices pending outcome of these
appeals. It remains IXYS intent to continue to contest the claims of International
Rectifier vigorously. Furthermore, IXYS expects to appeal any ruling of
contempt. While IXYS believes its defenses to the various claims and its
arguments on appeal are meritorious, there can be no assurance of a favorable
outcome. In the event of an adverse outcome, damages or injunctions awarded by
the U.S. District Court could be materially adverse to IXYS financial
condition and results of operations. In response to International Rectifiers claims, Samsung contends that
IXYS is contractually obligated under the terms of IXYS wafer supply agreement
with Samsung to defend it against the contempt claims made by International
Rectifier and indemnify and hold Samsung harmless in connection with such
claims. IXYS is considering Samsungs request in light of the terms of the
wafer supply agreement between IXYS and Samsung. While IXYS believes that
neither it nor Samsung are or could be in violation of the injunction for
various reasons IXYS believes to be meritorious, including an express
reservation as to IXYS designed parts in the consent decree, there can be no
assurance of a favorable outcome. In the event of an adverse ruling against
IXYS on the ultimate issue of contempt, or if IXYS is obligated to defend and
indemnify Samsung, any damages awarded or injunction entered by the U.S.
District Court could be materially adverse to IXYS financial condition and
results of operations. In November 2000, IXYS filed a lawsuit for patent infringement against
International Rectifier GmbH in the County Court of Mannheim, Germany. The
lawsuit charged International Rectifier with infringing at least two of IXYS
German patents. These patents cover key design features of IXYS proprietary
integrated power module technology, which the lawsuit alleged International
Rectifier had been infringing in products sold in Germany. The lawsuit sought
damages and an injunction prohibiting the continued infringement by
International Rectifier. On March23, 2001, a public hearing took place in Mannheim, Germany, and
International Rectifier did not deny making use of the above patents. On April27,
2001, the County Court of Mannheim rendered a judgment in IXYS favor that
enjoined International Rectifier from marketing, utilizing, importing or
possessing two of IXYS German patents, and imposed a fine of up to EUR
256,000 to the state or imprisonment of International Rectifiers managing
director for each violation of the injunction. In addition, International
Rectifier was ordered to disclose to IXYS information about its previous sales
activity, offers of sales, advertisements, production costs and profits
concerning the infringed patents. International Rectifier was also ordered to
pay attorney fees and past and future damages and unjustified enrichment
resulting from International Rectifiers infringing practices, as calculated by
the information to be provided to IXYS by International Rectifier.
International Rectifier appealed the judgment to the Court of Appeals in
Karlsruhe. Subsequent to a hearing on this appeal in March, the Court of Appeals
in Karlsruhe ruled in favor of IXYS and the judgment entered by the
County Court of Mannheim is now final. Notwithstanding this appeal, IXYS had
begun enforcing the judgment of the County Court of Mannheim; in order to do so
IXYS was required to pay EUR532,000 as a form of bond to be held by the
County Court of Mannheim. In lieu of the bond, the court accepted a
bank guarantee. Although International Rectifier has a right to
appeal the ruling of the Appeals Court in Karlsruhe, the bond may be returned
to IXYS and IXYS may continue to enforce the judgment of the County Court of
Mannheim. International Rectifier has also begun to disclose information to
IXYS pursuant to the judgment for purposes of calculating our damages award. On February8, 2001, IXYS filed a lawsuit against International Rectifier
Italia S.p.A. in the Civil Court of Monza, Italy, for patent infringement of at
least two of IXYS European patents, which correspond to the German patents
involved in the above-described legal proceeding in Germany. The lawsuit seeks
the seizure of semiconductor modules produced by International Rectifier that
infringe on IXYS patents and an injunction against further production of such
modules by International Rectifier in Italy. At a hearing on March8, 2001, the
judge rejected International Rectifiers arguments that the Monza tribunal was
not competent to hear the case and nominated an expert to comment on the
technical details of the alleged patent infringement. Following the scheduled
submission of technical writs by the parties in May 2001, the expert submitted
written comments in June 2001. On June27, 2001, the Civil Court of Monza
rendered a preliminary injunction in IXYS favor with respect to certain 53. Table of Contents
IXYS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
claims of infringement by International Rectifier S.p.A. Under the terms
of this preliminary injunction, IXYS is permitted to seize, and International
Rectifier S.p.A. is prohibited from distributing, certain of the allegedly
infringing semiconductor modules. The injunction is an interlocutory measure
that remains in effect until there has been a judgment on the merits. Hearings
on the merits of the law suit were held on December12, 2001, January24 2002
and February21, 2002. It could be as long as several years before a judgment
on the merits is rendered. While IXYS believes its claims against International Rectifier in the
Civil Court of Monza, Italy are meritorious, there can be no assurance of a
favorable outcome. IXYS does not believe that an adverse ruling by the Civil
Court of Monza would have a significant negative impact on the results of
operations, financial performance or liquidity of IXYS. 7.COMMON STOCK A two-for-one split of IXYS common stock was effected on August10, 2000

As of March31,
2002, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $921,000 in Germany and $6,900,000 in the UK available
to reduce its future foreign taxable income. These foreign net
operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely. Under the
foreign tax regulations the amounts of and benefits from net
operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain
circumstances. Currently management has determined that no valuation
allowance is required against its deferred tax assets as it is more
likely than not that the deferred tax assets can be realized. 12.COMPUTATION OF NET INCOME PER SHARE Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated as follows in
