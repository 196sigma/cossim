StatementsNote 1 Nature of Operations and Basis of PresentationNature of operationsWe are a global leader in the design, manufacture and service delivery of technology-based solutions for the upstream energy industry.We seek to change the way wells are drilled by delivering safer and more efficient solutions that add real value by reducing the costs of drilling for, and producing, oil and natural gas.Our product and service offerings consist mainly of equipment sales and services to drilling contractors and oil and natural gas operating companies throughout the world.Basis of presentationThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP and include the accounts of all consolidated subsidiaries after the elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions.Unless indicated otherwise, all amounts in these consolidated financial statements are denominated in United States U.S. dollars.All references to US$ or $ are to U.S. dollars and references to C$ are to Canadian dollars.Subsequent EventsWe conducted our subsequent events review through the date these consolidated financial statements were filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC.Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesUse of estimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, uncollectible accounts receivable, valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets, determination of income taxes, contingent liabilities, self-insurance liabilities, stock-based compensation and warranty provisions.We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources.Actual results could differ from those estimates.Cash and cash equivalentsCash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments with original maturities of less than three months, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.We maintain restricted cash investments pledged for certain letters of credit and other miscellaneous activity. We classify such restricted cash investment balances in other current assets. The aggregate carrying amounts of our restricted cash investments was $10 millionand $27 millionat December31, 2015and 2014, respectively. Allowance for doubtful accountsWe establish an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on our historical experience and our assessment of specific outstanding accounts that are probable of loss.Uncollectible accounts receivable are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount less than the outstanding historical balance or when we determine the balance will not be collected41Table of ContentsInventories and inventory reservesInventories consist primarily of top drives and tubular services parts, spare parts, work in process and raw materials to support ongoing manufacturing operations and the installed base of specialized equipment used throughout the world.We have several valuation methods for our various types of inventories and consistently use the following methods for each type of inventory:We value our work in process manufactured equipment using standard costs, which approximate actual costs for raw materials, direct labor and appropriate manufacturing overhead allocations;We value our finished manufactured equipment at the lower of cost or market using specific identification; andWe value our spare parts at the lower of cost or market using the average cost method.Research and engineering expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from inventory cost.We establish reserves for obsolete inventory and for inventory in excess of demand based on our usage of inventory on-hand, technical obsolescence and market conditions, as well as our expectations of future demand based on our manufacturing sales backlog, our installed base and our development of new products.Property, plant and equipmentProperty, plant and equipment are carried at cost.Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.The costs of replacements, betterments and renewals that extend the useful life are capitalized.When properties and equipment, other than top drive units in our rental fleet, are sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the books and the resulting gain or loss is recognized on our consolidated statement of income.When top drive units in our rental fleet are sold, the sales proceeds are included in revenue and the net book value of the equipment sold is included in cost of sales and services on our consolidated statement of income. Proceeds from the sale of these top drives are included in proceeds from the sale of operating assets and the difference between revenues and the cost of sales and services is included in gain on sale of operating assets in our consolidated statement of cash flows.Property, plant and equipment used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group.The Company determined that the appropriate level to group its assets for impairment purposes is: 1 Top Drive assets and 2 Tubular Services assets.If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows for an asset group is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period in which the determination of the impairment is made.Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants.Long-lived assets committed by management for disposal within one year are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, less cost to sell, with fair value determined using a binding negotiated price, if available, or the present value of expected future cash flows as previously described.Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment, including capital leases, is computed on the following basis:Asset  buildings and leaseholdsBuildingsLeasehold  yearsLease termDrilling equipmentTop drive rental unitsTubular services equipmentSupport  days5 7 years5 7 yearsManufacturing equipmentStraight-line5 7 yearsOffice equipment and  development costsFurniture and  5 years5 years5 years3 4 yearsAs we had an impairment indicator as of December31, 2015, we reviewed our property, plant and equipment for impairment, however, the results of the analysis did not indicate any impairment. 42Table of ContentsGoodwill and other intangible assetsGoodwill, resulting from business combinations, is initially recorded at acquisition-date fair value.Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test, which we perform as of December 31, or upon the occurrence of a triggering event.An impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of our goodwill is less than the carrying amount of that goodwill. We perform our goodwill impairment tests at the reporting unit level using the Income Approach and Market Approach. As a result of our annual impairment test as of December31, 2015, we have fully impaired $327 millionand $17 millionof goodwill assigned to our Tubular Services and Top Drive reporting units, respectively.During the years ended December31, 2014and 2013management concluded that goodwill was not impaired.Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are capitalized at their acquisition-date fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.Our intangible assets that have finite useful lives consist primarily of customer relationships, patents and non-compete agreements.We review our intangible assets for impairment when circumstances indicate their carrying values may not be recoverable as measured by the amount their carrying values are exceeded by their fair values. Our intangible assets are evaluated for impairment as a component of the fixed asset groups discussed above. Deferred income taxesDeferred income taxes are determined using the liability method and are provided on all temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities, except for deferred taxes on income considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries.Deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.The effect of a change in tax rates applied to deferred income taxes is recognized in the period that the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized.Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in interest expense and other expense, respectively, on our consolidated statements of income.Contingent liabilitiesWe recognize liabilities for loss contingencies, including legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with such loss contingencies, when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated.Such estimates may be based on advice from third parties or on managements judgment, as appropriate.Revisions to our contingent liabilities are reflected in income in the period in which facts become known or circumstances change that affect our previous judgments with respect to the likelihood or amount of the probable loss.WarrantiesWe provide product warranties on equipment sold pursuant to manufacturing contracts and recognize the anticipated cost of these warranties in cost of sales and services when sales revenue is recognized.We estimate our warranty liability based upon historical warranty claim experience and specific warranty claims.We periodically review our warranty provision and make adjustments to the provision as claim data and historical experience change.Per share informationBasic earnings loss per share of common stock is calculated using the weighted average number of our shares outstanding during the period.Diluted earnings loss per share of common stock is calculated using the treasury stock method, under which weassume proceeds obtained upon exercise of in the money share-based payments, granted under our compensation plan, would be used to purchase our common shares at the average market price during the period.Diluted earnings loss per share includes the shares used in the basic net income calculation, plus our unvested restricted shares, performance stock units and outstanding stock options, to the extent that these instruments dilute earnings loss per share.No adjustment to basic earnings loss per share is made if the result of the diluted earnings loss per share calculation is anti-dilutive43Table of ContentsRevenue recognitionWe recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. For product sales, revenue is recognized upon delivery when title and risk of loss of the equipment is transferred to the customer, with no right of return. For revenue other than product sales, we recognize revenue as the services are rendered based upon agreed daily, hourly or job rates.Top Drive Sales- We determine the transfer of title and risk of loss in accordance with contracts with our customers and the related International Commercial Terms. We generally require customers to pay a non-refundable deposit with their purchase orders. Customer advances or deposits are deferred and recognized as revenue when we have completed all of our performance obligations related to the sale.Top Drive Rentals and Tubular Services -Revenue generated from specific time, materials and equipment contracts is based upon agreed daily, hourly or job rates and price and recognized as amounts are earned in accordance with the contract terms.Revenue generated from materials and equipment sales is recognized upon delivery in accordance with the contract terms.Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are recognized in net revenue.Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales and services.Operating leasesWe have entered into non-cancelable operating lease agreements primarily involving office space.Certain of these leases contain escalating lease payments and we recognize expense on a straight-line basis, which is more representative of the time pattern in which the leased property is physically employed.In certain instances, we are also entitled to reimbursements for part or all of leasehold improvements made and record a deferred credit for such reimbursements, which is amortized over the remaining life of the lease term as a reduction in lease expense.Research and engineering expensesWe expense research and engineering costs when incurred.Payments received from third parties, including payments for the use of equipment prototypes, during the research or development process are recognized as a reduction in research and engineering expense when the payments are received.We include in research and engineering expense, costs for buildings and properties, salaries and employee benefits, materials and equipment, administrative activities and allocations of corporate costs.Stock-based compensationOur stock-based compensation plan provides for the grants of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share units and other stock-based awards to eligible directors, officers, employees and other persons.We measure stock-based compensation cost for awards as of grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award less an estimated rate for pre-vesting forfeitures. For stock option grants, we use a Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the estimated fair value. For market-based performance awards, we use a Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the estimated fair value. For restricted stock units, the fair value is the average of the high and low price of our stock as traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market on the date of grant. For equity-classified awards, we recognize compensation expense on a graded basis over the vesting period with estimated pre-vesting forfeitures being adjusted to actual forfeitures in the month of forfeiture and actual vestings in the month of vesting. The graded basis of amortization accelerates the recognition of compensation expense for a three year vesting period, with generally 61%being recognized in the first year, 28%being recognized in the second year and 11%being recognized in the third year. Compensation expense for our equity-classified awards is recorded as an increase to common shares.Consideration received on the exercise of stock options is recorded as an increase to common shares. For liability-classified awards, we recognize compensation expense based on the fair value of the award for the portion of the service period fulfilled at the end of each reporting period. The liability is recorded in accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding increase or decrease to compensation expense.The tax benefit for stock-based compensation is included as a cash inflow from financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We recognize a tax benefit only to the extent it reduces our income taxes payable. For purposes of determining the amount of tax attributes utilized in a given year as compared to the deduction for stock-based compensation, we apply the with-and-without approach. This approach considers deductions for stock-based compensation to be the last item of tax benefit recognized after all other deductions and utilization of prior year carryforwards44Table of ContentsForeign currency translationThe U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all of our worldwide operations.Our cumulative translation adjustment of $355 millionincluded in accumulated other comprehensive income resulted from the translation of assets and liabilities of our Canadian operations, which used the Canadian dollar as the functional currency prior to January 1, 2010. This cumulative translation adjustment will be adjusted only in the event of a full or partial disposition of our Canadian operations.Recent accounting pronouncementsIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU 2016-2, Leases Topic 842which is a comprehensive new leases standard that amends various aspects of existing accounting guidance for leases. It will require recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Note disclosures.In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes Topic 740: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified as noncurrent in the financial statements. The classification change for all deferred taxes as noncurrent simplifies entities' processes as it eliminates the need to separately identify the net current and net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability in each jurisdiction and allocate valuation allowances. We elected to early adopt this accounting standard as of December 31, 2015 and applied it prospectively. Prior periods in our Consolidated Financial Statements were not retrospectively adjusted. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory Topic 330: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires inventory not measured using either the last in, first out LIFO or the retail inventory method to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal and transportation. The new standard will be effective January 1, 2017 and will be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted.We are evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Note disclosures.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2019-09,Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606, which clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue. This guidance includes the required steps to achieve the core principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard will be effective January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2017. We are evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Note disclosures45Table of ContentsNote 3Sale of Casing DrillingOn June4, 2012, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Casing Drilling segment to Schlumberger Oilfield Holdings Ltd. and Schlumberger Technology Corporation together, the Schlumberger Group for a total cash consideration of approximately $466 million, including a working capital purchase price adjustment. During the year ended December31, 2013, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $14 millionprimarily from the working capital purchase price adjustment, in addition to the $124 millionpre-tax gain recognized in 2012. The table below sets forth the details contributing to the gain on sale in thousands:Total cash consideration$46,625Fixed assets, net11,999Inventories, net10,839Accounts receivable, net8,330Transaction costs1,670Gain on sale of Casing Drilling$13,787Note 4AcquisitionsOn May 7, 2014, we purchased substantially all of the operating assets of Tech Field Services, LLC TFS for total consideration of approximately $64 million, including $50 millionof cash and $14 millionof contingent earn-out obligations. The range of earn-out obligations is from $0to $20 millionand the obligation expires in May 2016. TFS, established in 2006 in Magnolia, Texas, provides parts, maintenance and repairs for multiple top drive manufacturers, including TESCO top drive units. In addition to its core AMSS business, TFS offered hydraulic top drive rental units to customers. The acquired assets included four top drive rental units, parts inventory and various administrative assets. We allocated approximately $47 millionof the purchase price to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and approximately $17 millionto goodwill in the Top Drive reporting unit.On November19, 2013, we completed the transaction to acquire certain intellectual property assets of Custom Pipe Handlers Canada Inc. CPH, a private catwalk mechanization technology company located in Canada. The purchase price was allocated to the intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.Note 5Details of Certain AccountsAt December31, 2015and 2014, prepaid and other current assets consisted of the following in thousands:20152014Prepaid taxes other than income taxes$4,048$4,168Prepaid insurance1,1443,481Other prepaid  cash9962,664Non-trade receivables2,1051,503Deferred job  December31, 2015and 2014, accrued and other current liabilities consisted of the following in thousands:20152014Accrued payroll and benefits$12,448$18,202Accrued taxes other than income taxes4,1734,194Other current  of ContentsNote 6InventoriesAt December31, 2015and 2014, inventories, net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventories, by major classification were as follows in thousands:20152014Raw materials$53,595$67,275Work in progress1,9442,866Finished  evaluated the carrying value of our global inventory by estimating part-by-part inventory turnover and we projected sales estimates based on the current operating environment and the timing of forecasted economic recovery.Based on our analysis, we determined that certain inventory items had a net realizable value that was less than its carrying amount. Accordingly, we recorded an aggregate inventory charge of $135 millionfor the year ended December31, 2015. Nocharges were taken during 2014. Reserves for inventory included on our consolidated balance sheets at December31, 2015and 2014were $118 millionand $27 million, respectively.Note 7Property, Plant and EquipmentAt December31, 2015and 2014, property, plant and equipment, by major category were as follows in thousands:20152014Land, buildings and   equipment16,30314,302Office equipment and other33,05632,836Capital work in  Accumulated  net book value of used top drive rental equipment sold included in cost of sales and services on our consolidated statements of income was $05 million, $22 millionand $31 millionduring the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively.We assumed capital leases with our acquisition of Premiere Casing Services - Egypt S.A.E Premiere.

This fair value measurement is based on significant unobservable inputs in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the purchase agreements and utilizes assumptions with regard to future cash flows, probabilities of achieving such future cash flows and a discount rate. The contingent earn-out obligations are measured at fair value each reporting period and changes in estimates of fair value are recognized in earnings.The discount rate used to calculate the contingent earn-out obligation is calculated by weighting our after-tax required returns on debt and equity by their respective percentages of total capital plus a certain premium. The return required by each class of investor reflects the rate of return investors would expect to earn on other investments of equivalent risk. We determined it would be appropriate to use a discounted rate equal to our weighted average cost of capital WACC of 90%plus a 5%premium due to current market risk conditions for a total discount rate of 140%. Performing a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate for the contingent earn-out obligation, we noted that the fair value would decrease approximately 6%to 7%for every 10%increase in the discount rate.The table below presents a reconciliation of the fair value of our contingent earn-out obligations that use significant unobservable inputs Level 3 in thousands:Balance at beginning of  to fair value940Balance at December 31, 2015$7448Table of ContentsWe measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets are recognized at fair value when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Other than the impairment of goodwill discussed in Note 12, we did not recognize any impairments on those assets required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.Note 9Long Term DebtLong term debt consists of the following in thousands:December 31,20152014Capital leases$$25Other notes payableCurrent portion of long-term debt25Non-current portion of long-term debt$$We entered into our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement on April27, 2012the Credit Facility, to provide a revolving line of credit of $125 million, including up to $20 millionof swing line loans collectively, the Revolver. The Credit Facility has a term of five yearsand all outstanding borrowings on the Revolver are due and payable on April27, 2017.The Credit Facility bears interest at a margin above LIBOR, federal funds rate, or the prime rate for U.S. dollar loans as determined by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in New York.We are required to pay a commitment fee on available, but unused, amounts of the credit facility of 0375-0500 percentper annum and a letter of credit fee of 100-200 percentper annum on outstanding face amounts of letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility. Amounts available under the Revolver are reduced by letters of credit issued under our Credit Facility, not to exceed $50 millionin the aggregate.Amounts available under the swing line loans may also be reduced by letters of credit or by means of a credit to a general deposit account of the applicable borrower.The availability of future borrowings may also be limited in order to maintain certain financial ratios required under the covenants. The Credit Facility contains covenants that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of this type, including a leverage ratio, a minimum net worth and limitations on allowable amounts for the disposal of obsolete assets and annual capital expenditures and a fixed charge coverage ratio.The Credit Facility prohibits incurring any additional indebtedness outside the existing Credit Facility in excess of $50 millionand contains other restrictions, including paying cash dividends to shareholders, which are standard to the industry.All of our direct and indirect material subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Mexico and Indonesia as well as one of our Cyprus subsidiaries are guarantors of any borrowings under the Credit Facility.At December31, 2015, we had nooutstanding borrowings under the Revolver and $13 millionin letters of credit outstanding within our Credit Facility. On February 29, 2016, we received a waiver under the Credit Facility the Waiver for the Company failure to comply with certain financial covenants under the Credit Facility as of the end of the fiscal quarter ending December31, 2015. The Waiver is effective from February 29, 2016 through and including the date on which we deliver, to our lenders, our financial statements and compliance certificate, both with respect to the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2016. Under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to, among other things, i not permit the leverage ratio to be greater than 300to 10 at any time, ii maintain a consolidated net worth of not less than $3942 millionas of the end of the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2015, iii not permit the interest coverage ratio to be less than 300to 10 as of the end of any fiscal quarter, and iv if the leverage ratio is greater than 20to 10 as of the end of any fiscal quarter, not permit the consolidated capital expenditures to be greater than the sum of consolidated EBITDA calculated for the most-recently completed four fiscal quarters plus net cash proceeds from asset sales for the most-recently completed four fiscal quarters. As of the end of the fiscal quarter ending December31, 2015, the Company had a leverage ratio of 033, a consolidated net worth of $3750 millionand an interest coverage ratio of 25. Under the Waiver, the lenders waived any failure of the Company to maintain the requisite leverage ratio, consolidated net worth and interest coverage ratio covenants under the Credit Facility as of the end of the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2015. In the same waiver, the lenders waived compliance with the consolidated capital expenditures covenants though the Company was in compliance as of December 31, 2015. The Waiver includes the following restrictions on the Company, which will be effective from February 29, 2016 through and including the date on which we deliver, to our lenders, our financial statements and a compliance certificate, both with respect to the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2016: i other than borrowings to make payments under outstanding letters of credit, the Company may not request any revolving loans under the Credit Facility, ii the Company may not request any swingline loans, iii the Companys outstanding letters of credit shall not exceed $10 million, with no more than $3 millionof such $10 millionconstituting letters of credit under the Credit Facility, iv the interest rate for all loans under the Credit Facility is set at a rate per annum equal to 350%, v the unused commitment fees are set at a per annum rate of 0625%, vi the letter of credit fees are set 49Table of Contentsat a per annum rate equal to 350%, vii prohibit the Company and its subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness, other than indebtedness under the Credit Facility and viii prohibit the Company from declaring or paying any dividends, ix prohibit the Company and its subsidiaries from making capital expenditures in an amount greater than $3 million, net of all net cash proceeds received from asset sales.

It is then followed by a short, time-based vesting period to permit adequate time to calculate performance. The award is based on the annual performance of our stock price as compared to the stock price of a group of our peers. The performance stock unit performance objective multiplier could range from zerowhen threshold performance is not met to a maximum of twotimes the initial award.For performance stock units granted in December 2014, the performance period runs for three yearsbeginning on the January 1, 2015 until December 31, 2017. It is then followed by a short, time-based vesting period to permit adequate time to calculate performance. We had two types of performance stock units; the first type is contingent upon the threeyear cumulative earnings per share achieved by the Company EPS as measured against sliding targets that vary based on the revenue achieved over that same period and the second type is based on the threeyear average return on capital employed ROCE as measured against targets that vary based on the revenue achieved over that same period.

Under the terms of the related retirement agreement, upon retirement all unexercised and unexpired stock options granted prior to December 31, 2013 became vested 100%. Consequently, the vesting date of the unexercised options was accelerated to January 1, 2015 and accordingly, the remaining unamortized expense of $03 millionwas recognized over the final service period. In addition, all unvested restricted stock units and performance stock units were cancelled, which resulted in reversal of previously recognized expense of $08 millionat December31, 2014. In addition, transition and retirement cash bonuses of $23 millionwere paid under this agreement.Note 11Income Taxes We are an Alberta, Canada corporation.We conduct business and are taxed on profits earned in a number of jurisdictions around the world. Income taxes have been provided based on the laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are conducted or in which we are considered a resident for income tax purposes.Our income loss before income taxes consisted of the following in thousands:December  States60,6453,5041,422Other  loss before  of ContentsOur income tax provision consisted of the following in thousands:December  States3758491,161Other   States8,5262,66047Other   tax  we are taxable in a number of jurisdictions around the world, our effective tax rate, which is income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax earnings, fluctuates from year to year based on the level of profits earned in these jurisdictions and the tax rates applicable to such profits.The combined Canadian federal and Alberta provincial income tax rate was 264%for 2015and was 25%for 2014and 2013.A reconciliation of the statutory rate and the effective income tax rate is as follows:Year Ended December 31,201520142013Tax expense benefit at statutory tax rate264%250%250%Effect of:Tax rates applied to earnings not attributed to Canada2613758U.S. state taxes011313Non-deductible expenses383303Foreign exchange adjustments220228Change in valuation allowance3472407Research and development tax credits073121Change in uncertain tax positions and tax audit  expense benefit at effective tax rate130%442%298%Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its basis as reported on our consolidated financial statements.The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on enacted tax laws and rates currently in effect in the jurisdictions in which we have operations54Table of ContentsDecember 31,20152014Deferred tax assets:Loss  liabilities and reserves9,61210,358Tax credit  plant and equipment14,00512,133Stock  tax assets60,09734,889Less: Valuation allowance47,0636,624Total deferred tax assets$13,034$28,265Deferred tax liabilities:Property, plant and   deferred tax  deferred tax assets  tax assets relating to tax benefits of employee stock-based compensation have been reduced to reflect stock options exercised and restricted stock units and performance share units that vested during the year. Some exercises and vestings result in tax deductions in excess of previously recorded benefits based on the option value at the time of grant windfalls. Although these additional tax benefits or windfalls are reflected in gross net operating loss carryforwards reflected on our tax returns, the additional tax benefit associated with the windfall is not recognized until the deduction reduces taxes payable. For the year ended December31, 2015, we generated net operating losses in Canada, U.S. and other international jurisdictions. In Canada and the U.S. we are able to carry a portion of these losses back to previous years to offset prior year income and generate tax refunds of $20 million. The remainder of the net operating losses are carried forward. We also had deferred tax assets related to various tax credit carryforwards in Canada and the U.S. At December31, 2015, we had $268 millionand $35 millionof deferred tax assets related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, respectively. We have recorded a valuation allowance on the entire balance of these carryforward deferred tax assets since it is more likely than not that future income necessary to utilize these carryforwards will not be realized. No provision is made for taxes that may be payable on the repatriation of accumulated earnings in foreign subsidiaries of $1350 millionon the basis that these earnings will continue to be used to finance the activities of these subsidiaries.It is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred income taxes associated with these unremitted earnings.At December31, 2014, we had an accrual for uncertain tax positions of $26 million. During 2015, we reduced our accrual by $10 millionin uncertain tax positions for prior year as we effectively settled the related examinations with no payment of tax and increased our accrual by $01 millionin uncertain tax positions for the current year. We reversed $02 milliondue to a lapse in the statute of limitations, leaving a balance of $15 millionat December31, 2015. Out of the $15 million, $02 millionis included in a current liability, as we expect resolution within the next twelve months. The remaining $13 millionis included in long term liabilities. The total amount of the $15 millionunrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $11 million55Table of ContentsA reconciliation of the beginning and ending accrual for uncertain tax positions is as follows in thousands:December 31,201520142013Balance, beginning of  in tax positions for prior years994Increase in tax positions for prior years556Increase in tax positions for current year94299308Legal settlements1,998Lapse in statute of limitations178206Balance, end of  related to uncertain tax positions is recognized in interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in other expense on our consolidated statements of income. At December31, 2015and December31, 2014, we had accrued $01 million, respectively, for the potential payment of interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. We are subject to Canadian federal and provincial income tax and have concluded substantially all Canadian federal and provincial tax matters for tax years through 2007.We are also subject to U.S. federal and state income tax and have concluded substantially all U.S. federal income tax matters for tax years through 2012.In addition to the material jurisdictions above, other state and foreign tax filings remain open to examination.We believe that anyassessment on these filings will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.We believe that appropriate provisions for all outstanding issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years.However, audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty.Therefore, additional provisions on tax-related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.Note 12Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsGoodwillA reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component. As such, the first step to identifying reporting units is to identify the operating segments in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting. Consistent with prior years, we have identified fouroperating segments. These fouroperating segments are defined by the Company as Top Drive, Tubular Services, Research and Engineering and Corporate. The Research and Engineering and Corporate segments are allocated to the Top Drive and Tubular Services operating segments for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. Prior to 2014, we also had a Casing Drilling operating segment but it was disposed of in 2012. For the year ended December31, 2014, we had $327 millionand $17 millionof goodwill assigned to our Tubular Services and Top Drive reporting units, respectively. The goodwill impairment review is performed annually as of December 31 or upon the occurrence of a triggering event. At December31, 2015, we utilized the Income Approach 50%weighted and the Market Approach 50%weighted to test for impairment. The 2015impairment test utilized the rolling annual forecasts and our multi-year forecast for the Income Approach and certain financial information of publicly traded peer companies for the Market Approach. The Income Approach estimated fair value through the present value of future discounted cash flows and the Market Approach estimated fair value by applying industry ratios to each reporting unit. Included in the Income Approach are assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, future gross margins, future selling, general and administrative expenses and an estimated WACC. We calculated the WACC by weighting the after tax required returns on debt and equity by their respective percentages of total capital plus a current market risk factor. For the Market Approach, we identified peer companies for each reporting unit by focusing on companies which competed in either the Top Drive or Tubular Services businesses. We used threecommon multiples for each reporting units and applied them to Tescos historical performance metrics in order to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using the Market Approach56Table of ContentsDuring the year ended December31, 2015, we noted declines in the market value of our stock, oil and natural gas prices and utilization. Due to these indicators, step one of our annual impairment test concluded that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than the carrying value of its net assets. As a result, we performed the second step of the impairment test, which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of that goodwill. The step two impairment test indicated that the goodwill for our reporting units was fully impaired. Accordingly, we recognized an aggregate impairment of $344 millionas of December31, 2015. We did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill during the years ended December31, 2014and 2013.At December31, 2015and 2014, the change in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows in thousands:December 31,20152014Balance, beginning of  See Note  end of year$$34,401Other intangible assetsAt December31, 2015and 2014, the estimated useful life, carrying amount and accumulated amortization of our intangible assets were as follows in thousands:20152014Estimated useful lifeGross carrying amountAccumulated amortizationNet intangible assetsGross carrying amountAccumulated amortizationNet intangible assetsAmortized intangible assetsCustomer relationships7 - 10  - 14  agreements5  - 10  expense related to our intangible assets for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, was $10 million, $15 millionand $12 million, respectively, and is included in cost of sales and services in our consolidated statements of income.Future estimated amortization expense related to our intangible assets for the next five years is expected to be as follows in thousands:Years ending December 31,Amortization  approximate remaining weighted-average useful lives for the various asset classes are as follows: 1 Customer Relationships - 35years, 2 Patents - 33years, 3 Non-Compete agreements - 08years and 4 Other - 59years We did not recognize any impairment losses on our intangible assets during the years ended December31, 2015, 2014or 201357Table of ContentsNote 13Warranties Changes in our warranty accrual for the years ended December31, 2015and 2014were as follows in thousands:December 31,20152014Balance, beginning of  end of year$893$3,370In 2015, we recorded additional warranty expense of $15 millionrelated to operational issues related to our catwalk units.

Note 14Commitments and ContingenciesLegal contingenciesIn the normal course of our business, we are subject to legal proceedings brought by or against us and our subsidiaries.None of these proceedings involves a claim for damages exceeding ten percentof our current assets on a consolidated basis. The estimates below represent our best estimates based on consultation with internal and external legal counsel.There can be no assurance as to the eventual outcome or the amount of loss we may suffer as a result of these proceedings.Weatherford LitigationWeatherford International, Inc. and Weatherford/Lamb Inc. together, Weatherford filed suit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division in December 2007 the Marshall Suit, alleging infringement of certain Weatherford patents. In August 2008, we filed a patent infringement suit against Weatherford, National Oilwell Varco, L.P., Offshore Energy Services, Inc. and Frank Casing Crew Rental Tools, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas - Houston Division the Houston Suit. The Houston Suit claimed infringement of twoof our patents related to our CDS. We settled the Marshall Suit and Houston Case with Weatherford on January 11, 2011. We settled the Houston Suit with the other defendants and a joint motion to dismiss was granted by the U.S. District Court in April 2015.Federal and State Unpaid Overtime ActionThe Company is currently participating in an arbitration, based on the Companys dispute resolution process, with 38current and former employees the Employees who had worked or are working in various states. The Employees claim that they are owed unpaid overtime wages including liquidated damages under the Federal Labor Standards Act FLSA and the applicable state laws of various states, including New Mexico and Colorado. The case is assigned to a three- judge panel of arbitrators. On October 22, 2015, an arbitration panel agreed that the case could proceed as a class action. If a class is ultimately certified, discovery will begin. At December31, 2015and as of the date of this report, we maintain an estimated reserve for potential exposure.Other contingenciesWe are contingently liable under letters of credit and similar instruments that we enter in connection with the importation of equipment to foreign countries and to secure our performance on certain contracts.At December31, 2015and 2014, our total exposure under outstanding letters of credit was $54 millionand $83 million, respectively.At December31, 2015, the accounts receivable balance included approximately $20 millionof accounts receivables from a customer in Mexico for the period of May 2013 through July 2014 that are unbilled due to a contractual rate dispute. We are seeking collection of this amount through an official dispute resolution process with the customer. These receivables have not been reserved at December31, 2015as we believe the probable outcome of the dispute resolution process will be favorable58Table of ContentsCommitmentsWe have operating lease commitments expiring at various dates, principally for administrative offices, operation facilities and equipment.Rental expense for all operating leases was $113 million, $83 millionand $56 millionfor the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively.Future minimum lease commitments under non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more as of December31, 2015are as follows in thousands:Years ending December 31,Minimum lease  of December31, 2015, we had $85 millionin manufacturing purchase commitments for executed purchase orders that were submitted to respective vendors.Note 15Segment InformationBusiness segmentsPrior to the sale of the Casing Drilling business during the second quarter of 2012, our fivebusiness segments were: Top Drive, Tubular Services, Casing Drilling, Research and Engineering and Corporate and Other. On June4, 2012, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Casing Drilling segment, which consisted of the proprietary Casing Drilling technology. Our Top Drive segment is comprised of top drive sales, top drive rentals and after-market sales and service.Our Tubular Services segment includes both our automated and conventional tubular services.Our Research and Engineering segment is comprised of our internal research and development activities related to our automated tubular services and top drive model development, as well as the Casing Drilling technology prior to the sale. Our Corporate and Other segment consists of expense at the corporate level, which includes general and administrative costs and selling, marketing and other expenses that are not directly related to or allocated down to other segments in our internal reporting.We measure the results of our business segments using, among other measures, each segments operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations.Overhead costs include field administration and operations support.At a business segment level, we incur costs directly and indirectly associated with revenue.Direct costs include expenditures specifically incurred for the generation of revenue, such as personnel costs on location or transportation, maintenance and repair and depreciation of our revenue-generating equipment.Certain sales and marketing activities, financing activities, corporate general and administrative expenses and other income expense and income taxes are not allocated to our business segments59Table of ContentsSignificant financial information relating to these segments is as follows in thousands:Year Ended December 31, 2015Top DriveTubular ServicesCasing DrillingResearch EngineeringCorporate  and   expense16,009Loss before income taxes$118,410Year Ended December 31, 2014Top DriveTubular ServicesCasing DrillingResearch EngineeringCorporate  and  income  expense8,099Income before income taxes$38,444Year Ended December 31, 2013Top DriveTubular ServicesCasing DrillingResearch EngineeringCorporate  and  income  expense4,554Income before income taxes$50,286Other ChargesIn response to the continued downturn in the energy industry and its corresponding impact on our business outlook, we continued certain cost rationalization efforts throughout 2015. Accordingly, we recorded restructuring charges in continuing operations, primarily related to headcount reductions, of $109 millionfor the year ended December31, 2015.

Furthermore, the continued devaluation of local currency coupled with delayed and/or uncollectible payments from our customers, have made our ability to collect receivables increasingly difficult. As business conditions in Venezuela continued to deteriorate in the fourth quarter of 2014, we assessed the recoverability of our long-lived assets in the country. We performed an undiscounted cash flow assessment and concluded the future undiscounted cash flows did not recover the net book value of the long-lived assets based 61Table of Contentson our current assumptions of the Venezuelan operations. As such we estimated the fair value of the long-lived assets based on the estimated market value of the asset base within Venezuela using indications of what a knowledgeable, willing buyer would pay to a knowledgeable, willing seller in the market and recorded a charge of approximately $06 millionas of December 31, 2014. Given the same circumstances, we also applied the lower of cost or market principle to the value of our inventory in country and concluded that it was probable that we would not recover the cost basis in our inventory. Accordingly we applied the lower of cost methodology to value our inventory and recorded an inventory charge of $10 millionto properly state the inventory at net realizable value as of December 31, 2014. Further, we concluded based on recent billing approval and payment history that we had a probability of loss on the recovery of our accounts receivable with Petrleos de Venezuela, S.A. companies and recorded an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts for $16 million. As of December 31, 2014, the total aggregate charges recorded in Venezuela were $32 millionof which $16 millionwas recorded as cost of sales and services related to impairment loss on long-lived assets and write down of the inventory to net realizable value and $16 millionas selling, general and administrative costs pertaining to the increase for the allowance for doubtful accounts.On November 9, 2015, we completed the sale of substantially all of our Venezuelan fixed assets and inventory for total cash consideration of $25 million. As of December 31, 2015, we have recorded a reserve of $15 millionagainst the outstanding sale proceeds. In connection to the sale, we recognized a net loss of $05 million. Major customers and credit riskOur accounts receivable are principally with major international and national oil and natural gas service and exploration and production companies and are subject to normal industry credit risks.We perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers and grant credit based upon past payment history, financial condition and anticipated industry conditions.Customer payments are regularly monitored and a provision for doubtful accounts is established based upon specific situations and overall industry conditions.Many of our customers are located in international areas that are inherently subject to risks of economic, political and civil instabilities, which may impact our ability to collect those accounts receivable.The main factors in determining the allowance needed for accounts receivable are customer bankruptcies, delinquency and managements estimate of ability to collect outstanding receivables based on the number of days outstanding and risks of economic, political and civil instabilities.Bad debt expense is included in selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.On December 17, 2015, the government of Argentina announced the end of most of its currency controls and allowed the Argentine Peso to be traded freely. Consequently, the Peso weakened 32%against the U.S. Dollar, resulting in a $61 millionforeign exchange loss for the month of December 2015. The lifting of currency controls, however, permits us more cost effective access to cash generated in Argentina.Procurement of materials and suppliesWe procure materials and components from many different vendors located throughout the world.A portion of these components are electrical in nature, including permanent magnet motors, induction motors and drives.We also purchase hydraulic components, such as motors, from certain suppliers located in the United States.In order to manufacture many of our proprietary parts, we require substantial quantities of steel.We select our component sources from, and establishsupply relationships with, vendors who are prepared to develop components and systems that allow us toproduce high performance, reliable and compact machines.For both our electric and hydraulic top drive systems we source key components, such as AC motors, power electronics and hydraulic systems from vendors who havedevelopedthese components for commercial, often non-oilfield applications and who have adapted them for service conditions specific to our applications. Consequently, our ability to maintain timely deliveries and to provide long term support of certain models may depend on the supply of these components and systems.We attempt to minimize risks associated with this dependency through the development of supply agreements to maintain acceptable levels of ready components62Table of ContentsNote 16Quarterly Financial Data unauditedThe following table presents unaudited quarterly financial data for 2015and 2014in thousands, except for per share amounts:For the 2015 quarterly period endedMarch 31June 30September 30December    per  the 2014 quarterly period endedMarch 31June 30September 30December   income  per  of ContentsItem1B.Unresolved Staff  Proceedings15Item! 4.Mine Safety  for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities16Item 6.Selected Financial Data18Item 7.Controls and Procedures.Evaluation of disclosure controls and proceduresWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the SEC reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified by the SECs rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As ofDecember31, 2015, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer participated with management in evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer determined the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December31, 2015at the reasonable assurance level. Remediation of Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingDuring the year ended December31, 2015 we completed our plan to remediate a material weakness in our internal controls over accounting for foreign currency calculations. Management assessed and concluded that the internal controls over accounting for foreign currency calculations were effective. Therefore, the previously reported material weakness related to accounting for foreign currency calculations has been remediated as of December31, 2015.During the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed the following actions related to our remediation plan:Reconfigured the accounting system to properly convert calculated foreign currency depreciation expense and cost of goods sold into U.S. dollar functional currency for the affected country ledgersEnhanced the system to properly remeasure monetary balance sheet accounts and calculate unrealized gains and lossesTrained local accounting resources to identify and remediate foreign currency transactions that may give rise to foreign exchange differences; andDeveloped written accounting procedures around the accounting for and revaluation of foreign currency transactionsWe will continue to focus on maintaining the enhancements in the system of internal controls that was developed and implemented. Additionally, we will continue to train our accounting professionals on our accounting for foreign exchange transactions as required.Managements report on internal control over financial reportingManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15f of the Exchange Act. The Companys internal controls are designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance as to the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company, Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; andProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statementsA control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a system of internal control over financial reporting, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, 64Table of Contentscontrols can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any control system is also based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on managements assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2015. Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements of Tesco Corporation included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of Tesco Corporation internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management identified no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December31, 2015, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting other than the remediation of the material weakness in our internal controls over the accounting for foreign currency calculations65Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Tesco Corporationand subsidiariesWe have audited Tesco Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework the COSO criteria. Tesco Corporation and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Tesco Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Tesco Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2015 and our report dated March4, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/Ernst and Young LLP Houston, TexasMarch4, 201666Table of ContentsItem1B.Unresolved Staff  Proceedings15Item! 4.Mine Safety  for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities16Item 6.Selected Financial Data18Item 7.Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.The information required by this Item other than the information set forth in the next paragraph in this Item 10 will be included under the sections captioned i Proposal One-Election of Directors; ii Executive Officers; iii Corporate Governance and Board Matters; and iv Section 16a Beneficial Ownership Compliance found in main section Other Information in our proxy statement for the 2016annual meeting of shareholders, which information is incorporated into this Report on Form 10-K by reference.We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to our officers, directors and employees.
