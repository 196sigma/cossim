24             INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
MetaSolv Software, Inc.  We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of MetaSolv Software, Inc.
as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 1999. In connection with our audits of the financial
statements, we also have audited the related financial statement schedule.
These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule
based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December
31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1999 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion,
the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein. KPMG LLP

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997
1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
MetaSolv Software, Inc. the Company, a Delaware corporation
headquartered in Plano, Texas, develops, delivers and supports software
designed to make it easier for emerging competitive communications service
providers to take, manage and fulfill orders for service from their customers.
These communications service providers offer a full array of communications
services including local and long distance telephone services, high-speed data
services and Internet services, often as a bundled offering. The Company
derives substantially all if its revenue from the sale of licenses, related
professional services and maintenance and support of its Telecom Business
SolutionTM, or TBSTM, packaged software to these competitive
communications service providers.
a Revenue Recognition
The Company software products are licensed to customers through the
Company direct sales force. Software license revenue is generally recognized
when the following criteria have been met: a a written contract for the
license of software has been executed, b the Company has delivered the
product to the customer, c the license fee is fixed or determinable, and d
collectibility of the resulting receivable is deemed probable. Revenue from
maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue
for implementation, training and other services is recognized as the service
is performed.
The Company is frequently engaged to provide consulting and implementation
services in connection with the licensing of its software. In situations where
such services include significant modification or customization of the
software or are otherwise essential to the functionality of the software,
revenues relating to the software license and services are aggregated and the
combined revenues are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.
Revenue earned using the percentage-of-completion method is based on
management estimate of progress towards completion. Changes to estimates of
progress towards completion, if any, are accounted for as a change in estimate
in the period of the change. Of total deferred revenues, $703,416 and $49,328
as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, represent billings in excess
of costs and related profits on certain contracts accounted for under the
percentage-of-completion method. Of total unbilled receivables, $0 and
$335,000 as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, represent costs and
related profits in excess of billings on contracts accounted for under the
percentage-of-completion method.
Accounts receivable include only those amounts due from customers for which
revenue has been recognized. Deferred revenue includes amounts received from
customers for which revenue has not been recognized. Accounts receivable at
December 31, 1999 and 1998 includes $408,854 and $583,573, respectively, which
has not been paid in accordance with the retainage provisions of a long-term
contract with a customer.
In October 1997, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee issued
Statement of Position SOP No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition as
amended by SOP-98-4 and SOP-98-9. Effective January 1, 1998, the Company
adopted SOP 97-2. SOP 97-2 generally requires revenue from software
arrangements to be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the
relative fair values of the elements, such as software products, consulting,
education services, installation or post-contract customer support. Fair
values are based upon vendor specific objective evidence. If evidence of fair
value for each element of the arrangement does not exist, all revenue from the
arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does
exist, or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
Years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 b Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of investments in an interest-bearing money market
account and investment grade securities issued by corporations and U.S.
government agencies with maturities of three months or less. For purposes of
the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid
investments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of
purchase to be cash equivalents.
c Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which
range from three to twelve years.
d Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short
maturities.
e Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of
technological feasibility of the product are expensed as incurred. After
technological feasibility is established, any additional software development
costs are capitalized in accordance with SFAS No. 86. The Company believes its
process for developing software was essentially completed concurrently with
the establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, no software
development costs have been capitalized to date.
f Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairments to be recognized are measured by the amount by which
the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets
to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair
value less cost to sell.
g Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the amounts of existing
assets and liabilities recorded for financial reporting purposes and their
respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is reflected in income tax expense in the
period that includes the enactment date.
h Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities                    31               METASOLV SOFTWARE, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
Years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
i Stock Option Plan
The Company applies the intrinsic value-based method of accounting
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations, in accounting for
its fixed plan stock options. As such, compensation expense is recorded only
if the fair value of the underlying stock exceeded its exercise price on the
date of grant.
j Comprehensive Income
On January 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. SFAS No. 130
establishes standards for reporting and presentation of comprehensive income
and its components in a full set of financial statements. The statement
requires additional disclosures in the financial statements, but does not
affect the Company financial position or results of operations. Net income
loss as reported in the statements of operations is the Company only
component of comprehensive income during all periods presented.
k Earnings Loss Per Share of Common Stock
Earnings loss per share of common stock is presented in accordance with
the provisions of SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share. Under SFAS No. 128, basic
earnings loss per share excludes dilution for potentially dilutive
securities and is computed by dividing income or loss available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings loss per share reflects the potential
dilution that could occur if stock options or preferred stock were exercised
or converted into common stock. Potentially dilutive securities are excluded
from the computation of diluted earnings loss per share when their inclusion
would be antidilutive.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
Years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997  The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those
temporary differences become deductible. Based upon the level of historical
taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods
which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more
likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible
differences.
4 Accrued Expenses
Accrued expenses consist of the following in thousands                                 December 31,

5 Line of Credit
The Company has a committed revolving line of credit agreement with a bank,
expiring in July 2002, in the amount of $6,000,000 and an equipment term loan
facility that provides for borrowings up to $4,000,000. Interest on
outstanding borrowings accrues at the bank prime rate of interest 85% as
of December 31, 1999 and 1998. The facility is secured by substantially all
of the Company tangible assets. As of December 31, 1999 and 1998 there were
no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit. The Company also
had a standby letter of credit in lieu of a security deposit totaling
$1,300,000 as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, which reduces the borrowing
availability under the revolving line of credit.
6 Convertible Preferred Stock and Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
In 1996, the Company issued 6,458,480 shares of Class B redeemable
convertible preferred stock for net cash proceeds of $2,475,400. In 1997, the
Company issued 279,680 additional shares of Class B redeemable convertible
preferred stock for cash proceeds of $110,400. In 1998, the Company issued
2,857,146 shares of Class C redeemable convertible preferred stock for cash
proceeds of $10,000,011. In November 1999, effective with the company
initial public offering, each share of outstanding convertible preferred stock
and redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted to one share of
common stock. These share amounts have been adjusted for stock splits in June
1998 and October 1999.
7 Stock Option Plan and Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In 1992, the Company adopted a stock option plan pursuant to which the Board
of Directors may grant stock options to officers and employees. In August
1999, the Company adopted the MetaSolv Software, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan
which was subsequently merged with the existing stock option plan. The plan at
its adoption authorized grants of options to purchase up to 9,320,000 shares
of authorized but unissued common stock. The number of shares issuable under
the plan increases by 5% of the Company outstanding common stock as of
January 1 of each of the first five calendar years following the plan merger.
Accordingly, as of January 1, 2000, the number of shares authorized under the
plan increased to 11,044,017. Stock options are

Years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997
granted with an exercise price equal to the stock fair market value at the
date of grant. All options have terms of ten years or less, and most options
vest in four or five equal cumulative installments beginning on the first
anniversary of the grant date.
At December 31, 1999, there were 1,895,860 additional shares available for
grant under the plan. The per share weighted-average fair value of stock
options granted for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 was $99 415 and $075, respectively, as estimated using the minimum value option-
pricing model with the following assumptions: expected dividend yield of 0 risk-free interest rate of 6%, and an expected life of five years.
The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for stock options
granted to employees and non-employee directors under its stock option plans.
The Company recorded $656,400 of deferred compensation during 1999, as a
result of granting stock options with exercise prices below the estimated fair
value per share of the Company common stock at the date of grant. Deferred
compensation has been recorded as a component of stockholders' equity and is
being amortized as a charge to operations over the vesting period of the
applicable options. Amortization of deferred compensation of $100,000 was
recognized in 1999.
Had the Company determined compensation cost based on the fair value at the
grant date for its stock options under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, the Company net
income would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below in

December 31, 1995. Therefore, the full impact of calculating compensation cost
for stock options under SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in the pro forma amounts
presented above because compensation cost is reflected over the options'
vesting periods of five years and compensation expense pertaining to stock
options granted in prior periods is not considered.

11 Segment Information and Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company has adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for the
way that public business enterprises report information about operating
segments in annual financial statements and requires those enterprises to
report selected information about operating segments in interim financial
reports issued to stockholders. The method for determining what information to
report is based on the way management organizes the operating segments within
the Company for making operating decisions and assessing financial
performance.
The Company chief operating decision-maker is considered to be the Chief
Executive Officer CEO. The CEO reviews financial information presented on
a company-wide basis accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues
by product and service line for purposes of making operating decisions and
assessing financial performance. The financial information reviewed by the CEO
is identical to the information presented in the accompanying statements of
operations. Therefore, the Company operates in a single operating segment:
communications software and related services.
Revenue information regarding operations for different products and services
is as follows in thousands                              Year ended December

Post-contract customer support. 10,509  4,672  897
Total  $73,007 $42,576 $9,299
The Company has derived substantially all of its revenues from the United
States and Canada. Accordingly, the Company does not produce reports that
measure performance of segments by geographic region.
The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on
revenues only. The Company does not assess the performance of its segments on
other measures of income or expense, such as depreciation and amortization,
operating income or net income. In addition, the Company assets are not
allocated to any specific segment, and the Company does not produce reports
that measure segment performance based on any asset-based metrics. Therefore,
segment information is presented only for revenues.
