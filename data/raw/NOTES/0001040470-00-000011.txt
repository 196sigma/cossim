Aehr Test Systems   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 14 a 1 and 2 on page 44 present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Aehr Test Systems and its
subsidiaries at May 31, 2000 and 1999, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended May 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted
our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States which require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BUSINESS   Aehr Test Systems Company was incorporated in California in June 1977
and primarily designs, engineers and manufactures test and burn-in equipment
used in the semiconductor industry. The Company principal products are the
MTX massively parallel test system, the MAX and ATX burn-in systems, test
fixtures and the DiePak carrier.
CONSOLIDATION   The financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly
owned foreign sales corporation FSC and both its wholly owned and
majority owned foreign subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. The Company 25% interest in ESA Electronics PTE Ltd.
ESA, a Singapore company, is accounted for under the equity method.
Equity income recorded related to ESA totaled $76,000, $127,000 and $155,000
in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The Company has another
investment which is accounted for at cost.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND TRANSACTIONS   Assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiaries are
translated into U.S. Dollars from Japanese Yen and German Marks using the
exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Additionally, their
revenues and expenses are translated using exchange rates approximating
average rates prevailing during the fiscal year. Translation adjustments
that arise from translating their financial statements from their local
currencies to U.S. Dollars are accumulated and reflected as a separate
component of shareholders' equity and comprehensive income loss.
Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate changes
denominated in currencies other than the local currency are included in the
statements of operations as incurred.
USE OF ESTIMATES   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS   Cash equivalents consist of money market instruments, commercial paper
and other highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of
three months or less. All investments are classified as available-for-sale.
Investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with
unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, if any, included as a component of
shareholders' equity.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK   The Company sells its products primarily to semiconductor manufacturers
in North America, the Far East, and Europe. As of May 31, 2000,
approximately 33%, 58% and 9% of accounts receivable are from customers
located in the United States, the Far East and Europe, respectively. As of
May 31, 1999, approximately 48%, 18% and 34% of accounts receivable are from
customers located in the United States, the Far East and Europe,
respectively. Three customers accounted for 42%, 15% and 11% of accounts
receivable at May 31, 2000, and two customers accounted for 21% and 13% of
accounts receivable at May 31, 1999. Three customers accounted for 23%, 19%
and 14% of net sales in fiscal 2000, respectively and three customers
accounted for 22%, 18% and 12% of net sales in fiscal 1999, respectively.
Two customers accounted for 47% and 13% of net sales in fiscal 1998. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally
does not require collateral. The Company also maintains allowances for
potential credit losses and such losses have been within management
expectations. The Company uses letter of credit terms for some of its
international customers.
32   Primarily all of the Company cash, cash equivalents and short-term cash
deposits are deposited with major banks in the United States and Japan. The
Company invests its excess cash in money market funds and short-term cash
deposits. The money market funds and short-term cash deposits bear the risk
associated with each fund. The money market funds have variable interest
rates, and the short-term cash deposits have fixed rates. The Company has
not experienced any losses on its money market funds or short-term cash
deposits.
INVENTORIES   Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates
cost on a first-in, first-out basis or market.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT   Property and equipment are stated at cost. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the term of the
related lease. Furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment are depreciated
on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The ranges of
estimated useful lives for furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment are
as follows Leasehold  life of the lease
Furniture and  2 to 15 years
Machinery and  4 to 11 years
Test  4 to 11 years
GOODWILL   Cost in excess of the fair value of net assets of acquired companies of
$956,000 is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 245 years and is
included in other assets, net of accumulated amortization of $586,000 and
$538,000 at May 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
REVENUE RECOGNITION   Revenue for all products except royalties is recognized upon shipment of
product provided no significant obligations remain and collectability is
probable. Provision for the estimated future cost of warranty is recorded at
the time the products are shipped. Actual warranty costs incurred have not
materially differed from those provided. Royalty revenue related to PTB
licensing income is recognized when paid by the licensee. This income is
recorded in net sales.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE   Costs incurred in the research and development of new products or systems
are charged to operations as incurred.
Costs incurred in the development of software programs for the Company
products are charged to operations as incurred until technological
feasibility of the software has been established. Generally, technological
feasibility is established when the software module performs its primary
functions described in its original specifications, contains features
required for it to be usable in a production environment, is completely
documented and the related hardware portion of the product is complete.
After technological feasibility is established, any additional costs are
capitalized. Capitalized costs are amortized over the estimated life of the
related software product using the greater of the units of sales or straight-
line methods over ten years. Capitalized cost, net of accumulated
amortization, of approximately $57,000 was included as of May 31, 1997.
System software development costs were fully amortized as of May 31, 1998,
and no new system software development costs were capitalized in fiscal 1999
and 2000.
During 1994, the Company entered into a cost-sharing research agreement
with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA, a U.S.
government agency, under which DARPA will provide co-funding up to a maximum
amount of $65 million during fiscal 1994 through September 2000 for the
development of a new product that will allow for burn-in and test at the
wafer level. Payments from DARPA are received upon DARPA approval of the
achievement by the Company of milestones as outlined in the contract. The
Company recognizes such reimbursements as a reduction to research and
development expenses in an amount equal to actual reimbursable project costs
incurred. At May 31, 2000 and May 31, 1999, no outstanding payments were due
from DARPA.
33 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   Carrying amounts of certain of the Company financial instruments
including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due
to their short maturities. Based on borrowing rates currently available to
the Company for loans with similar terms, the carrying value of notes payable
approximates fair value.
The Company investments are composed primarily of government and
corporate fixed income securities, certificates of deposit and commercial
paper. Long-term investments mature after one year but less than two years.
While it is the Company general intent to hold such securities until
maturity, management will occasionally sell particular securities for cash
flow purposes. Therefore, the Company investments are classified as
available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Through May 31, 2000, no
material losses had been experienced on such investments.
Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, net of
tax, are computed on the basis of specific identification and are included in
shareholders' equity. Realized gains, realized losses, and declines in
value, judged to be other-than-temporary, are included in other income. The
cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method and
interest earned is included in other income.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS   In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be
performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted
cash flows associated with the assets would be compared to the asset
carrying value to determine if a write-down is required.
INCOME TAXES   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences
between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established
when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be
realized.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION   The Company accounts for its employee stock based compensation in
accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and presents disclosures required
by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock
Based Compensation.
EARNINGS PER SHARE EPS DISCLOSURES   The Company has adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, and all prior
periods have been restated accordingly. Basic EPS is computed by dividing
income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed giving
effect to all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during
the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of the incremental
common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options for all periods.
34   In accordance with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 128, a
reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of basic and diluted EPS is
provided as follows in thousands, except per share amounts                           Year Ended May 31,

Basic income loss per share.  $038  $034   $038

Stock options to purchase 150,000 and 122,000 shares of common stock were
outstanding in fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively, but were not included in
the computation of diluted loss per share because the inclusion of such
shares would be anti-dilutive.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   In June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 137 SFAS 137, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective
Date of FASB Statement No. 133. SFAS 137 amends Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133 SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, to defer its effective date to all
fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS 133
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments
including standalone instruments, as forward currency exchange contracts and
interest rate swaps or embedded derivatives and requires that these
instruments be marked-to-market on an ongoing basis. These market value
adjustments are to be included either in the income statement or
stockholders' equity, depending on the nature of the transaction. We are
required to adopt SFAS 133 in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2001. We
are in process of evaluating the effect of SFAS 133 on our financial
statements.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements, which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and
disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. SAB 101 outlines the basic criteria that must be met to
recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosures related to revenue
recognition policies. The Staff Accounting Bulletin was amended in June 2000
to delay the implementation to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001. We
are currently evaluating SAB 101 and its effects on the Company revenue
recognition policies and practices.
In April 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
FASB interpretation of No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving
Stock Compensation, an interpretation of Accounting Principles Board APB
Opinion No. 25. Among other issues, this interpretation clarifies the
definition of employees for purposes of applying APB Opinion No. 25, the
criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non-compensatory plan,
the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a
previously fixed stock option or award and the accounting for an exchange of
stock compensation awards in a business combination. This interpretation is
effective July 1, 2000, but certain conclusions in the interpretation cover
specific events that occur after either December 15, 1998 or January 12,
2000. To the extent that this interpretation covers events occurring during
the period after December 15                    35 1998, or January 12, 2000, but before the effective date of July 1, 2000, the
effect of applying this interpretation is recognized on a prospective basis
from July 1, 2000. We are currently reviewing stock grants to determine the
impact, if any, that may arise from implementation of this interpretation,
although we do not expect the impact, if any, to be material to our financial
statements. 2. INVENTORIES   Inventories are comprised of the following in thousands                          May 31,
