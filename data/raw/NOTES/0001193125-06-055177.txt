Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our report under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2005. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures provided reasonable assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective to accomplish their objectives. 
2005 FORM 10K Genesee Wyoming Inc55  REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of Genesee Wyoming Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and
15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Genesee Wyoming Inc.;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America;  provide reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of Genesee Wyoming Inc.; and
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial
statements. Internal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring including internal auditing practices, and actions
taken to correct deficiencies as identified. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005. Management based this assessment on criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Managements assessment included an evaluation of the design
of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of our assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of December31, 2005, we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who audited the consolidated financial statements of Genesee Wyoming Inc. included in this
report, has audited managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 and has issued an attestation report on managements assessment which attestation is included in
their report which appears herein. March14, 2006
