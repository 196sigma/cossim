36 PART II  Item 5. Controls and Procedures.  Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over our financial reporting. The design, monitoring and revision of the system of internal accounting controls involves, among other items, managements
judgments with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of specific control measures. The effectiveness of the control system is supported by the selection, retention and training of qualified personnel and an organizational structure that
provides an appropriate division of responsibility and formalized procedures. The system of internal accounting controls is periodically reviewed and modified in response to changing conditions. Internal audit consultants regularly monitor the
adequacy and effectiveness of internal accounting controls. In addition to the system of internal accounting controls, management maintains corporate policy guidelines that help monitor proper overall business conduct, possible conflicts of
interest, compliance with laws and confidentiality of proprietary information. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely providing them with material information
relating to us which is required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal control that occurred
during our last fiscal quarter, which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and
15d-15f of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and for performing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our system of internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; ii provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.  Management conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
Based on this evaluation, management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our internal control over financial

December 31, 2004 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein, which expresses unqualified opinions on managements assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004.

reports submitted by them. The Audit Committee meets several times during the year with management, the internal auditors and the independent auditors to discuss audit activities, internal controls and financial reporting matters. The internal
