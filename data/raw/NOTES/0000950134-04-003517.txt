balance sheet of Sipex Corporation and subsidiaries the
Company as of December31, 2003, and the
related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders equity and comprehensive income loss, and
cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Sipex Corporation and subsidiaries at
December31, 2003, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of

Description of Business Sipex Corporation Sipex or the
Company is a semiconductor company that designs,
manufactures and markets, high performance, value-added analog
integrated circuits ICs that are used primarily by
original equipment manufacturers OEMs operating in
the historically high growth markets of computing,
communications and networking infrastructure. While advances in digital technology have fueled
the demand for digital integrated circuits, they have also
created a rapidly growing demand for more precise, faster and
more power efficient analog ICs. Sipex possesses a broad
portfolio of analog ICs, organized into three product families:
power management, serial interface and optical storage. Sipex
uses its wafer fabrication facility in Milpitas, California and
a number of third party vendors to fabricate, package and test
its ICs. Sipexs products are sold either directly to
customers or through a global network of manufacturers
representatives and distributors.

Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies   
Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Sipex Corporation and all of its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates
that are particularly susceptible to changes include revenue,
sales returns, inventory valuation, restructuring reserves,
asset impairment and income taxes.   
Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of
an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed
or determinable and collectibility is reasonable assured. Future Electronics Inc. Future, a
related party, is our exclusive distributor for North America
and Europe. Sales to this distributor are made under an
agreement that provides protection against price reduction for
Futures inventory of our products. In addition, Future has
stock rotation rights. Pursuant to these stock rotation rights,
Future is permitted on a quarterly basis to return for credit up
to 10% of its total purchases during the most recent three-month
period. As the price of products sold to Future is not fixed or
determinable until resold by Future to the end customer, we
recognize revenue on sales to Future when Future sells the
products through to the end customer. Accounts receivable are
recognized and inventory is relieved upon shipment as title to
inventories generally transfers upon shipment at which point the
Company has a legally enforceable right to collection under
normal terms. For all other sales, revenue is recognized upon
title transfer and shipment because these distributors/customers
have no price protection and have limited return rights.
Distributors are permitted to return products limited to a
percentage of their purchases over a specified period of time.
We are able to estimate and establish appropriate reserves for
future returns from these distributors. For product sales
recognized at the time of shipment, we accrue for estimated
sales returns upon shipment based upon historical trends as well
as any known pending sales returns. In the fourth quarter of 2001, Sipex accepted
distributor orders from Future for certain products on a
discounted basis for which they had no rights of return other
than for product related issues, price protection or
cancellation rights and which were not governed by the terms of
the existing distributor contract. Revenue 41 Table of Contents SIPEX CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued from those orders were recognized at the time of
shipment, since those orders were non-cancelable, non-returnable
and for which such sales were not subject to the terms of the
Companys distribution agreement with the distributor,
including, without limitation, the price protection, restocking
and other returns rights the distributor is entitled to in the
agreement.   
Sales Returns To estimate reserves for future sales returns,
Sipex regularly reviews its history of actual returns for each
major product line. The Company also communicates monthly with
its channel partners to gather information about sell-through
activity, end user satisfaction and to determine the volume of
inventory in the channel. The results of this analysis is used
to estimate the reserves for sales returns. Reserves for future
returns are adjusted as necessary, based on returns experience,
returns expectations and communications with channel partners. In estimating reserves, Sipex also considers
unusual events and market conditions. It is possible that future
events such as the introduction of a competitive product,
product obsolescence, price competition, continued slowness in
the semiconductor industry and distributors desire to
decrease levels of inventory in the distribution channel could
result in significant changes in customer demand and cause
future returns to increase beyond historical levels. Management
believes that it is able to estimate returns, and establish
appropriate reserves for returns from customers for which Sipex
recognizes revenue as of shipment, using the process described
above. However, since reserves for estimated sales returns are
recorded as a reduction in revenues, any significant difference
between the Companys estimated and actual returns
experience, or changes in its estimate of reserves for future
returns, would be reflected in the Companys reported
revenues in the period Sipex determines that difference and
could have a material impact on the Companys future
results of operations.   
Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred.   
Net Loss Per Share Basic net loss per share is based upon the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted
net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of
common and common equivalent shares outstanding assuming
dilution. Common equivalent shares, consisting of outstanding
stock options, convertible debt and warrants, are included in
the per share calculations where the effect of their inclusion
would be dilutive. As the Company had net losses in 2003, 2002
and 2001, the weighted average number of common and common
equivalent shares outstanding equals the weighted average number
of common and common equivalent shares assuming dilution. A reconciliation of basic weighted average common
shares with diluted weighted average shares is as follows in

STATEMENTS Continued   
Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject
Sipex to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash
equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable.
Cash equivalents consist of deposits with, or guaranteed by,
major commercial banks, the maturities of which are three months
or less on the date of purchase. With respect to accounts
receivable, Sipex performs periodic credit evaluations of the
financial condition of its customers and typically does not
require collateral from them. Management assesses the need for
allowances for potential credit losses by considering the credit
risk of specific customers, historical trends and other
information. In addition, management reviews other inherent
risks in the portfolio based on current market conditions, the
economic environment and the Companys concentration of
credit risk.   
Fair Values of Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the
relatively short periods to maturity of the instruments. The
long-term related party debt see Related Parties below at
December31, 2003 approximates its fair value as the
Company entered into an agreement with the affiliates of Future
Electronics,Inc. to terminate the debt. During February
2004, the affiliates of Future exercised their rights to convert
the debt into 46million common shares of Sipex. This
related party debt was extinguished and recorded as equity in
the first quarter of 2004.   
Short-term Investments Investments, which primarily consist of highly
rated commercial paper with original maturities greater than
90days, are accounted for under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFASNo115, Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB.
Pursuant to the provisions of SFASNo115, the
Company has classified its investments as held to
maturity which represent investments that the Company
intends to hold to maturity and are recorded at amortized cost.   
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market. Costs are determined using the first-in, first-out
method.   
Inventory Valuation Sipex writes down inventory for estimated excess
quantities, obsolescence or unmarketability. In addition, the
Company writes down inventory costs to the lower of cost or
market. Excess and obsolete inventory is determined by comparing
current inventory to current backlog, anticipated future demand
and shipment history. Lower of cost or market adjustments are
determined by reviewing shipments during the quarter as well as
quarter beginning backlog and comparing standard cost to
anticipated market pricing. Inventories are written down to the
lower of cost or market which becomes the cost basis. In
estimating anticipated market pricing, the Company also
considers current market conditions, industry performance,
distributor inventory levels and sales to end-users and all
other relevant factors. If actual market conditions are less
favorable than those projected by management, additional
inventory write-downs may be required. Reviews of the valuation
of inventory are performed on a quarterly basis. In 2002, Sipex
recorded a $54million write-down for excess and slow
moving inventory, which included a $15million charge
relating to product lines sold or discontinued as part of the
Companys third quarter restructuring plan and a $700,000
charge for physical inventory adjustments. During 2003,
inventory with an adjusted zero cost basis that was included in
the $54million provision in 2002 was sold for
$10million. In 2003, the Company recorded
$28million related to write-downs for excess and slow
moving inventory. 43 Table of Contents SIPEX CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued   
Related Parties   
Future Electronics,Inc. Future Electronics, Inc. Future is
our exclusive distributor for North America and Europe. It is
also our largest distributor worldwide. During 2003, Future
increased its ownership of the Company and became a related
party. During 2002 and 2001, Future was not a related party,
however there were significant sales to Future. On
September27, 2002, Sipex sold a convertible secured note
the First Note with an attached warrant to an
affiliate of Future for an aggregate cash amount of
$120million. The Company recorded the First Note at
$104million and the warrant at $16million
recorded to additional paid-in capital based upon their
estimated fair values at the date of issuance using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The First Note paid a 575%
coupon and was convertible after one year into Sipex common
stock at a conversion price of $750per share. Following
the one year anniversary of the issuance of the First Note, the
Company could require the conversion of the First Note in
installments if for a period of time Sipex common stock traded
at a price in excess of 150% of the conversion price of $750.
The private placement also included a warrant to purchase
900,000shares of Sipex common stock exercisable for a
two-year period beginning on the one-year anniversary of the
date of issuance. The exercise price for the warrant is $29458.
The First Note was secured by a Deed of Trust on the
Companys land and building at Milpitas, California. On June20, 2003, Sipex sold a convertible
secured note the Second Note to an affiliate of
Future $103million net of issuance costs of $216,000.
The Second Note paid a 15% coupon rate per annum. The principal
amount of the Second Note was contingently convertible into a
maximum of 30million shares of Sipex common stock at a
conversion price of $352per share, subject to Future
attaining predetermined annual and/or cumulative sales levels
over a three-year period. Accordingly, in accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force EITFIssue No01-1,
Accounting for a Convertible Instrument Granted or Issued
to a Nonemployee for Goods or Services or a Combination of Goods
or Services and Cash, the Company was required to
recognize non-cash charges against net sales for the fair value
of these conversion rights earned by Future each period relative
to the sales target. The fair value of the conversion rights has
been measured pursuant to FASBNo123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and EITF
Issue No96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments
That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in
Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services. The Second
Note was secured by a Deed of Trust on the Companys land
and building at Milpitas, California as well as all other assets
of the Company, except for the Companys intellectual
property. In connection with the issuance of the Second Note,
the Company entered into a standstill agreement with affiliates
of Future, pursuant to which these security holders agreed not
to acquire more than 35% of our stock on a fully diluted basis.
Also, Sipex entered into a voting agreement with an affiliate of
Future, pursuant to which this security holder agreed that the
additional shares of the Companys common stock issuable
upon conversion of the Second Note iwill not be voted or
iiwill be voted in the same proportion as the votes cast
by all other shareholders of Sipex. During the fourth quarter of 2003, Sipex entered
into an agreement with the affiliates of Future Electronics to
convert the First Note and Second Note into common stock subject
to obtaining regulatory approval. In connection with the
agreement we accelerated the conversion rights of the Second
Note and received $30million and forgiveness of interest
on both notes of $411,000. As a consequence, non-cash charges of
$141million have been recognized against sales in 2003
representing the fair value of the conversion rights earned by
Future as well as the net cost from terminating the sales
incentive feature of the Second Note thereby vesting the
conversion rights. As of December31, 2003, affiliates of
Future held approximately 85million shares of
Sipexs common shares or approximately 30%. Upon the
regulatory approval in February 2004, the affiliates of Future
exercised their conversion rights to exchange both the First
Note and the Second Note for 46million of common shares
of Sipex, bringing their ownership to approximately 40%. As a
result of the conversion, all the related collateral and sales
incentives have been 44 Table of Contents SIPEX CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued waived. The warrant to purchase
900,000shares of Sipexs common stock for
$29458per share has not been exercised. The Company has a distributor agreement with
Future that provides for Future to act as Sipexs sole
distributor for certain products within North America and
Europe. Future has historically accounted for a significant
portion of the Companys revenues. It is the Companys
largest distributor worldwide, and accounted for 16% of total
net sales for the year ended December31, 2003, and 24% and
21% of total net sales for the years ended December31,
2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company anticipates that sales
of its products to Future will continue to account for a
significant portion of its revenues.   
Employees Sipex has included as other current assets
approximately $25,000 and $134,000 due from employees at
December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, which consist
mainly of amounts due to Sipex related to hiring and relocation
costs. These amounts are normally forgiven over periods of
employee service as agreed upon between the employee and Sipex.

Goodwill The Company adopted SFASNo142
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets effective
January1, 2002, thereby discontinuing annual goodwill
amortization of approximately $376,000. Upon adoption of
SFASNo142, the Company performed a goodwill
impairment test and concluded that there was no indication of
impairment and recorded no impairment charges as of
January1, 2002. In the second quarter of 2002, the Company
experienced a significant reduction in the fair value of its
common stock. The fair value decrease was primarily related to
the financial impact to Sipex of the continued global slowdown
in the semiconductor industry. As a result, the Company
performed a goodwill impairment test in accordance with
SFASNo142. The results of this impairment test
indicated that the full amount of the Companys goodwill of
$30million was not recoverable and was written off. The
Company recorded goodwill amortization of $376,000 during 2001. 45 Table of Contents SIPEX CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued The pro forma effects of the adoption of
SFASNo142 on net income and earnings per share for

Impairment of Long-lived Assets and
Long-lived Assets to be Disposed of Sipex reviews long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be
held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount
of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If such asset is considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported
at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to
sell see Note3.   
Foreign Currency Translation Foreign currency assets and liabilities are
translated into U.S.dollars at current rates, and
revenues, costs and expenses are translated at average rates
during each reporting period. Gains or losses resulting from
foreign currency transactions are included in earnings
currently, while those resulting from translation of financial
statements are shown as a separate component of other
comprehensive income loss in the statements of
shareholders equity.   
Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes
the enactment date.   
Stock-Based Compensation As allowed by SFASNo123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, amended by
SFASNo148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure, Sipex
accounts for its employee stock plans and employee stock
purchase plan, using the intrinsic value method under APB
Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations. In general, as the
exercise price of all options granted under these plans is equal
to the market price of the underlying common 46 Table of Contents SIPEX CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued stock on the grant date, no stock-based employee
compensation expense is recognized. In certain situations, under
these plans, options to purchase shares of common stock may be
granted at less than fair market value, which results in
compensation expense equal to the difference between the market
value on the date of grant and the purchase price. This expense
is recognized over the vesting period of the options and
included in operations. The table below sets out the pro forma amounts of
net loss and net loss per share that would have resulted for all
fiscal years presented, if Sipex accounted for its employee
stock plans under the fair value recognition provisions of
SFASNo123 in thousands, except per-share data.

respectively. The fair value of each Employee Stock Purchase
Plan share issued during 2003, 2002 and 2001 was estimated on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with no dividend yield and option lives of six months. For 2003,
volatility of 115% and 75% were used for the first and second
purchase periods, respectively. For 2002, volatility of 75% and
180% were used for the first and second purchase periods,
respectively. Volatility of 179% was used for the first and
second 2001 purchase periods. The risk free interest rate
assumed was 1%, 4% and 3% for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The weighted-average fair value of Employee Stock Purchase Plan
shares granted was $175 and $590, $272 and $362, and $676
and $473, for the first and second periods of 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively.   
Effect of Recent Accounting
Pronouncements In June 2002, the FASB issued
SFASNo146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFASNo146
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or
disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the
date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. This Statement
is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after
December31, 2002. On January1, 2003, the Company
adopted SFASNo146 and at the time of adoption,
there was no material impact on its consolidated financial
position or results of operations. 47 Table of Contents SIPEX CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No45, Guarantors Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others
FIN45. FIN45 requires that upon
issuance of a guarantee, a guarantor must recognize a liability
for the fair value of a stand-ready to perform obligation
assumed under a guarantee. Additionally, a guarantor must
recognize a contingent obligation to make future payments when
such obligation becomes probable and estimable. FIN45 also
requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim
and annual financial statements about the obligations associated
with guarantees issued. The recognition provisions of
FIN45 will be effective for any guarantees that are issued
or modified after December31, 2002. The adoption of FIN
did not have a material impact on the Companys
consolidated financial position or results of operations or cash
flows. In December 2002, the FASB issued
SFASNo148, Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure
an Amendment of SFAS123. SFASNo148
provides additional transition guidance for those entities that
elect to voluntarily adopt the provisions of
SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation. Furthermore, SFASNo148 mandates
new prominent disclosures in both interim and year-end financial
statements about the fair value based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results. SFASNo148 is effective
for fiscal years ending after December15, 2002. The
adoption of SFASNo148 on January1, 2003 did
not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated
financial position or results of operations as Sipex does not
intend to adopt the fair value method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities FIN46. This
interpretation provides guidance on the identification of
entities controlled through means other than voting rights.
FIN46 specifies how a business enterprise should evaluate
its interests in a variable interest entity to determine whether
to consolidate that entity. A variable interest entity must be
consolidated by its primary beneficiary if the entity does not
effectively disperse risks among the parties involved. In
December 2003 the FASB issued FIN46R which defers the
implementation date for the Company to the year ending
December31, 2004. As the Company does not have an interest
in a variable interest entity, it does not expect the adoption
to have a material impact on the Companys financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2003, the FASB issued
SFASNo149, Amendment of Statement133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
SFAS149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and
reporting for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for
hedging activities under SFASNo133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. SFAS149 will be effective for contracts
entered into or modified after June30, 2003. The adoption
of SFAS149 did not have a material impact on the
Companys consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. On May15, 2003, the FASB issued
SFASNo150, Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and
Equity. SFAS150 requires issuers to classify as
liabilities or assets in some circumstance three classes of
freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for
the issuer. Generally, SFAS150 is effective for financial
instruments entered into or modified after May31, 2003 and
is otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim
period beginning after June15, 2003. The Company adopted
the provisions of SFAS150 on June29, 2003, and the
adoption did not have an effect on its consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin SABNo104, Revenue
Recognition SAB No104, which codifies, revises
and rescinds certain sections of SAB No101, Revenue
Recognition, in order to make this interpretive guidance
consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing
guidance and SEC rules and regulations. The changes noted in SAB
No104 did not have a material effect on the
Companys consolidated results of operations, consolidated
financial position or consolidated cash flows. 48 Table of Contents SIPEX CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Restructuring and Impairment of Fixed
Assets In September 2002, Sipex announced a plan to
close the Companys four-inch wafer fabrication facility in
SanJose, California and change to a modified five day per
week work schedule from the seven day per week schedule in the
six-inch wafer fabrication facility in Milpitas, California.
These actions were taken to reduce the Companys cost
structure as a result of the continued slowdown in the
semiconductor industry and to align the structure with the then
current business plan, which included the sale and
discontinuance of the hybrid product line at the end of the
third quarter of 2002 and the discontinuance of the analog
display product line which was completed by the end of the first
quarter of 2003. These product families accounted for
approximately $40million of net sales in the third
quarter of 2002. These actions consolidated the Companys
operations and focused the Company on three core businesses
consisting of serial interface, power management and optical
storage. Below is a summary of the activity related to
restructuring, impairment of fixed assets and inventory costs

General Restructuring activities began in 2002 as the
Company transferred its back end manufacturing operations off
shore and completed the move of its headquarters and major
operations to Milpitas, California. During 2002, we recorded
restructuring charges of $29million, $47million of
fixed asset impairment charges and $19million of
inventory charges. Gross restructuring charges consisted of
employee severance costs of $524,000, management reorganization
charges of approximately $17million and accrued lease
expenses of $661,000 for the Companys SanJose,
California facility. These gross restructuring charges were
reduced in the fourth quarter of 2002 for a $661,000 reversal in
accrued lease costs for the Companys SanJose,
California facility due to the sale of the 4inch facility
in the first quarter of 2003 which included the assumption of
the lease by the third party purchaser and a $70,000 decrease in
employee termination costs. The remaining 2002gross
restructuring charges of $22million were further reduced
by $330,000 in 2003. In 49 Table of Contents SIPEX CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued October 2003, the Company established a
restructuring reserve of $11million for the unused
portion of its Billerica, Massachusetts facility. Fixed asset impairment charges for 2002 consisted
of $18million to write down the value of the machinery
and equipment in the SanJose, California facility to its
fair value, as a result of the closure of the SanJose
fabrication facility in the first quarter of 2003, and
$29million of fabrication equipment at the Milpitas,
California fabrication facility. The $19million inventory
write down, which is recorded as cost of sales, was established
to provide for the discontinued analog display and hybrid
product families. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company
recognized a gain of $384,000 due to the sale of a portion of
the inventory.   
Restructuring During 2001 Sipex recorded net restructuring
charges of $177,000 consisting of $534,000 for severance
payments related to the reduction of its workforce, partially
offset by a reduction of $357,000 in the restructuring accrual,
which was established in the fourth quarter of 1999. The
reduction in 2001 was due to the sale of the Calogic fabrication
facility, which had been planned for closure in 2001. As a
result of the sale, Sipex reduced both the facility exit related
and employee termination portions of the accrual due to the
assumptions of the facility by the new owners who retained many
of the employees to whom the Company had planned to pay
severance costs. The third quarter 2002 restructuring charges for
the above actions were $26million, which consisted of
$256,000 of severance costs related to a reduction in force of
approximately 50 employees at both manufacturing facilities 17million of severance and related costs to six former
management employees related to the Companys plan to
reorganize into six functional groups and facility costs of
$661,000 consisting mainly of the remaining lease payments at
the SanJose, California fabrication facility. In the fourth quarter of 2002, Sipex incurred
restructuring costs related to the transfer of the
Companys back end test operations from the Billerica,
Massachusetts facility to subcontractors in Malaysia. The
restructuring costs consisted of $268,000 of employee severance
related costs for the workforce reduction of approximately 60
employees and freight charges of $48,000 related to the
$20million sale of the Billerica, Massachusetts test
related machinery and equipment with a net book value of
$17million. Accrued severance costs as of
December31, 2002 were subsequently reduced by $330,000
which was originated from $17million of management
reorganization charges and $524,000 of employee severance costs
estimated in 2002. The remaining accrual was paid primarily
during the first half of 2003. In October of 2003, the Company established a
restructuring reserve of $11million for the unused
portion of its Billerica, Massachusetts facility. Sipex
currently has a design center occupying approximately one-fourth
of the space and are seeking a lessee for the unused balance of
the building. Accrued restructuring costs of future lease
payments net of estimated sublease income with associated costs
as of December31, 2003 for this facility included
short-term portion of $422,000 and long-term portion of
$535,000, respectively.   
Impairment Third quarter 2002 fixed asset impairment charges
totaled $47million consisting of $29million of
fabrication equipment on the Companys four-inch and
six-inch manufacturing product lines at the Milpitas, California
fabrication facility and $18million for the write down to
fair value of the machinery and equipment at the SanJose,
California fabrication facility which had been scheduled to be
closed by the end of the first quarter of 2003. In the first
quarter of 2003, the SanJose, California fabrication
machinery and equipment, which had been written down by
$18million, were sold to an unrelated third party. The
gain on the sale of the SanJose, California fabrication
machinery and equipment will be recorded upon collection of the
cash due to the length of time and related uncertainties
affecting their ultimate receipt. 50 Table of Contents SIPEX CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

At December31, 2003, the Company has
U.S.net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$1479million, which are available to offset future
Federal taxable income. These losses expire during the years
2005 through 2023. As of December31, 2003, a substantial
amount of the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to
annual limitations as a result of Internal Revenue Code
Section382 ownership changes, which have occurred in prior
years. At December31, 2003, the Company has
Massachusetts and California net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $1178million and $251million,
respectively. The Massachusetts net operating loss will expire
during the years 2005 though 2008, while the California net
operating loss will expire from 2010 through 2013. The valuation allowance increased by
$137million during the year ended December31, 2003.
In assessing the net realizable value of deferred tax assets,
management considers whether it is more likely than not that
some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The ultimate realization of deferred 52 Table of Contents SIPEX CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued tax assets is dependent upon the generation of
future taxable income during the periods in which those
temporary differences become taxable. Management considers the
scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected
future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this
assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income
and projections for future taxable income over the periods which
the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes that
it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets at
December31, 2003 will be realized in the future. At
December31, 2003, approximately $07million of the
valuation allowance is attributable to stock compensation
expense for tax purposes, that tax benefit of which, when

Shareholders Equity Sipex currently maintains six stock option plans.
1996 Stock Option Plan, 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Option
Plan, 1997 Stock Option Plan, the 1999 Stock Option Plan, the
2000 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan and the 2002 Nonstatutory
Stock Option Plan have had 1,200,000, 300,000, 1,200,000,
1,200,000, 1,000,000 and 2,000,000shares reserved for
issuance, respectively. The plans generally allow for options
which vest ratably over five years from the date of grant for
options granted before May 2002 and four years for options
granted after April 2002. These options expire ten years from
the date of grant. In October 2002, the Board of Directors voted
to reduce the number of shares available for issuance under the
1996 Stock Option Plan, 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Option
Plan and the 2000 Nonqualified Plan to 551,942, 82,000 and
671,990, respectively. In addition to stock option plans,
4,649,800shares of Sipex stock have been reserved for
issuance pursuant to options which have been granted to
employees outside of the option plans. Options for
6,640,064shares are outstanding as of December31,
2003. On April16, 2002, the Company issued
30million shares of common stock through a private
placement of securities, resulting in proceeds to the Company of
approximately $235million, net of placement agent fees
and other costs related to the issuance. Proceeds from the
offering of $69million were used to pay down the
Companys bank line of credit and the balance of
$165million was used to provide funding for general
corporate purposes. On October10, 2002, the Company made a
Tender Offer to exchange options to purchase an aggregate of
2,495,052shares of the Companys common stock,
whether vested or unvested, that have been granted under its
1996 Incentive Stock Option Plan, 1997 Stock Option Plan, 2000
Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, 2002 Nonstatutory Stock Option
Plan and certain stand-alone Option Plans that have exercise
prices greater than $750per share and that are held by
eligible employees. The option exchange offer, including all
withdrawal rights, expired at 5p.m. Pacific Time on
Friday, November8, 2002. Pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the option exchange offer, a total of 59 eligible
optionees participated in the option exchange program. On
November11, 2002, the Company accepted for cancellation
options to purchase 570,174shares of its common stock.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the offer, the Company
granted new options to purchase 245,054shares of its
common stock on May12, 2003 in exchange for the options
tendered and accepted. The exercise price of the new options was
the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the
new grant date of $395per share. The new options are
vested as to 25% of the shares on the date of the new grant and
thereafter will vest as to 25% of the shares on each subsequent
anniversary of the new option grant date. During 2002 and 2003, Sipex recorded $33,000 and
$61,000, respectively, in compensation expense due to the
accelerated vesting of stock options to the former executives. 53 Table of Contents SIPEX CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued In January 1996, the Board of Directors approved
the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, pursuant to which Sipex
is authorized to issue up to 500,000shares of common stock
to its full-time employees, nearly all of whom are eligible to
participate. In October 2002, the Board of Directors voted to
reduce the number of shares available for issuance under the
1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan to 400,000shares. Under
the terms of the Plan, employees can choose to have up to
10percent of their annual base earnings withheld each year
to purchase Sipexs common stock. The purchase price of
stock is 85 percent of the lower of its beginning-of-period or
end-of-period market price. As of December31, 2003,
approximately 34,000shares were available for issuance
under the Plan. A summary of the status of Sipexs stock

products. The Company is under obligation to make minimum
purchase commitments based on quarterly rolling forecasts
extending out one year. The initial term of the agreement is
five years with renewals on a negotiated basis. As of
December31, 2003, the minimum purchase commitment with
PolarFab was approximately $25million for the following
twelve months. In December 2002, Sipex entered into an agreement

years. As of December31, 2003, the total future payment
commitment was $21million. In June 2001, Sipex purchased the land, building
and equipment of its Milpitas, California wafer fabrication

paid $350million, consisting of $60million for the
land, $169million for the building and $121million
for machinery and equipment. The recorded cost of the machinery
and equipment purchased was reduced by a $14million
long-term liability recorded by Sipex through June30, 2001
as its estimated liability under the lease for the guaranteed
residual value of the equipment. Proceeds for the buyout were
provided through the liquidation of restricted cash investments
of $368million that had previously secured the lease of
