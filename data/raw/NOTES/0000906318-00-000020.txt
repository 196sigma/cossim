26 REPORT OF MANAGEMENT We, the management of LCA-Vision Inc., are responsible for the consolidated financial statements and the
information contained in this report, including its accuracy. We prepared the accompanying consolidated financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition to selecting appropriate
accounting principles, we are responsible for the way information is presented and its reliability. To report financial
results we must often make estimates based on currently available information and judgements of current conditions
and circumstances. We maintain an accounting system and related system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance
that the financial records are accurate and that the Company assets are protected. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
independent accountants, audit the financial statements and express their opinion on them. They perform their audit
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which consists of our outside Directors, meets periodically with

and Treasurer REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and 
Shareholders of LCA-Vision Inc. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders' investment, and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of LCA-Vision
Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States which require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

$80,045  23,199  26,714 See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Business We are a leading developer and operator of free-standing laser refractive surgery centers. Our laser refractive
surgery centers provide the facilities, equipment and support services for performing various corrective eye
surgeries that employ state-of-the-art laser technologies. The laser vision correction surgeries performed in our
centers are primarily laser in situ keratomileusis LASIK and photorefractive keratectomy PRK. The excimer
laser, which we have in each of our U.S. centers, can treat nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. We
previously managed multi-specialty laser surgery programs at medical facilities on a contract basis.  Revenue by source is comprised of  Laser refractive surgery - fees for surgeries performed at our consolidated centers.  Other - management fees for operating laser vision correction centers of investees; contractual fees for managing
multi-specialty laser surgery programs at hospitals; marketing and education program fees; and miscellaneous
sources. Certain operating costs and expenses  Medical professional and license fees - per procedure fees for the ophthalmologist performing laser vision
correction and the license fee of $260 per procedure in the U.S. paid to the laser manufacturer.  Direct costs of services - center rent and utilities, equipment lease and maintenance costs, surgical supplies, center
staff expense, and costs related to other revenue.  General and administrative - headquarters staff expense and other overhead costs. Depreciation and amortization - periodic charges to income for the costs of equipment and intangible assets
recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Consolidation Policy We use two different methods to report our investments in our subsidiaries and other companies - consolidation and
the equity method. Consolidation
We use consolidation when we own a majority of the voting stock of the subsidiary. This means the accounts of our
subsidiaries are combined with our accounts. We eliminate intercompany balances and transactions when we
consolidate these accounts. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of LCA-Vision Inc. LCA-Vision Ohio, Inc. Refractive Centers International, Inc. and Subsidiaries, and LCA-Vision Canada Inc. and Subsidiaries The Baltimore Laser Sight Center, Ltd. Equity Method
We use the equity method to report investments in businesses where we hold a 20% to 50% voting interest, giving
us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies. Under the
equity method we report our interest in the entity as an investment in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and our percentage share of the earnings losses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We own 43% of Silmalaseri Oy and report our investment under the equity method. Use of Estimates Management makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial statements under generally accepted
accounting principles. These estimates and assumptions affect various matters including our reported amounts of assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the dates of the financial
statements our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and  our reported amounts of revenues and expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations during the reporting
periods. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. Reclassifications We have reclassified certain prior-year amounts for comparative purposes. These reclassifications did not affect
consolidated financial position, net losses or cash flows for the years presented. Cash and Cash Equivalents For the purpose of reporting our cash flows, we consider highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90 days or
less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market value. Short-term Investments
Our short-term investments consist primarily of time deposits and obligations of U.S. government agencies with a
maturity of 90 days or more when purchased. Short-term investments are stated at cost, which approximates market
value. Our short-term investments at December 31, 1999 were dollars in thousands Federal Home Mortgage Corporation notes

June 30, 2000
2,100 37,299 Property and Equipment, Goodwill, and Depreciation and Amortization Property and Equipment
We show our property and equipment at its original cost. At the time property or equipment is retired, sold, or
otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are deducted from the amounts
reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and any gains or losses on disposition are recognized in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. We expense repair and maintenance costs as incurred. Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of the businesses over the fair value of the identifiable net assets
acquired. We amortize goodwill using the straight-line method over 40 years. Depreciation and Amortization
We compute depreciation using the straight-line method which recognizes the cost of the asset over its estimated
useful life. We use the following estimated useful lives for computing the annual depreciation expense: building, 5
to 31 years; furniture and fixtures, 5 to 7 years; medical equipment, 3 to 5 years; other equipment, 3 to 5 years.
Amortization of leasehold improvements is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations using the
straight-line method based on the lesser of the useful life of the improvement or the lease term. We assess the impairment of property and equipment and goodwill related to our consolidated subsidiaries
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable. Estimates of future cash
flows are used to determine if there is impairment; discounted cash flows are used to determine the amount of
impairment. Financial Instruments Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments
and short-term investments. Our policy is to place our temporary cash investments in overnight repurchase
agreements with The Provident Bank, the financial institution that provides our lines of credit. Credit risk with respect to short-term investments is limited because the investments consist of obligations of
agencies of the U.S. government and they mature in less than one year. Fair Values of Financial Instruments The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade receivables and accounts payable
approximate their fair values due to their short term maturities. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenues as services are performed. For procedures performed in certain states we do not record the
physician component of the procedure fee as revenue or expense. Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based employee compensation plans under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. Effective January 1, 1996, we adopted the
disclosure-only provision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and related
interpretations. Per Share Data Basic loss per share data is earnings or loss applicable to common shareholders divided by weighted average
common shares outstanding. Diluted per share data is earnings or loss applicable to common shareholders divided
by weighted average common shares outstanding plus potential common shares from dilutive securities such as
options and convertible securities. The table shows how we calculated diluted earnings per share and diluted shares
outstanding for the year ended December 31, 1999 amounts in thousands, except per share amounts. Income Numerator

exercise of any stock options or conversion of other securities since they would result in a reduced loss per share. 2. Shareholders' Investment Common Stock
We are authorized to issue up to 110 million shares of common stock. On June 30, 1999 we sold 5,000,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $800 per share. Net
proceeds approximated $37,300,000 after deducting discounts and commissions and our offering expenses,
including the fee to be listed on the Nasdaq National Market. Preferred Stock 
At December 31, 1999, there are no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. Class A 
In February 1999 certain holders exchanged their shares of Class A Preferred Stock for 14,925 shares of our
common stock. In 1999 our principal shareholder paid approximately $34,000 of a note due us with his shares of
Class A Preferred Stock. We retired the shares of Class A Preferred Stock received. Class B 
First and Second Interim Series
Our Board of Directors declared the payment of the cumulative unpaid dividend on our Class B Preferred Stock
First and Second Interim Series to the holders of record on July 31, 1999. The cash dividend paid was $462,000.
Subsequent to the payment of the dividend, the holders of the 126 shares issued and outstanding converted their
shares into 720,477 restricted shares of our common stock. 6% Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock 
At December 31, 1998, 5,702 shares of the 6% Series B-1 convertible preferred stock were outstanding. During the
three months ended March 31, 1999, these shares and dividends totaling $264,000 were converted into 3,994,642
shares of common stock. The holders of these shares had the right to purchase an additional $5 million of convertible preferred stock under
the same terms and conditions as the 6% Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock until May 11, 1999. In March 1999
certain majority holders of these shares agreed to accept 165,076 shares of our common stock in exchange for their
waiving their option to purchase the additional convertible preferred stock. In June 1999 a former holder of these
shares agreed to accept 25,396 shares of our common stock in the same type of exchange. These agreements
resulted in a non-cash charge of $375,000 recorded as other expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of
Operations for the year ended December 31, 1999. Warrants
During 1999, we issued warrants to purchase a total of 925,000 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $2
to $12 per share. The warrants were issued to an investment banking firm and a joint venture partner. Warrants to purchase 110,936 shares at $2 per share are currently exercisable. Warrants for 14,064 shares were
exercised. Warrants to purchase 800,000 shares at $12 per share were issued during the third quarter of 1999 of
which 200,000 are currently exercisable; the remaining warrants become exercisable in equal installments of
200,000 each as of December 31, 1999, 2000, and 2001. The warrants resulted in pre-paid expense for book purposes, using the Black-Scholes method, of $6,363,000. This
compensation will be amortized to income over a three year period which coincides with the term of the agreement
with Cole National Corporation to market laser vision correction as a managed care benefit. Amortization of
$39,000 is recorded in our 1999 Consolidated Statement of Operations. 3. Acquisitions Refractive Centers International, Inc.
On August 18, 1997, we issued 17,065,579 shares of our common stock to Summit Technology, Inc. Summit
and certain individuals for 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Refractive Centers International,
Inc. RCII. On May 4, 1998, we issued 200,000 shares of our common stock to an investment banking firm as compensation for
services related to the acquisition of RCII. The shares were recorded at their fair value on the date of issuance. We accounted for the acquisition of RCII using the purchase method of accounting as described in Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 16, Business Combinations, and related interpretations. The purchase method
required us to record in our Consolidated Balance Sheet the fair values of the assets and liabilities at the date of the
acquisition. We recorded the difference between the acquisition cost and the fair value of the identifiable net assets
acquired as goodwill. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed consisted of cash - $10,007,000; other net working
capital - $664,000; equipment - $9,511,000; and goodwill - $12,802,000. 4. Restructuring/Impairment Provision During the second quarter of 1998 we implemented a plan to close seven centers that were not contributing to our
profitability. The centers closed were primarily centers which had been operated by RCII. Costs associated with the
closings include $7,287,000 related the write-off of goodwill and leasehold improvements, $677,000 for the accrual
of costs for terminating leases and employees, and $2,536,000 for the write-down of idled lasers to their net
realizable values. At the time of completing the acquisition of RCII, we implemented a program to close certain centers, both acquired
and existing, and reduce overhead costs. We recorded a $1,000,000 restructuring provision for these closings
including $620,000 for facility rent and employee severance associated with closing the RCII centers as part of the
purchase price. Our 1997 Consolidated Statement of Operations includes revenues of $414,000 and operating losses
of $343,000 for these centers. We also wrote-off our investment in two of our unconsolidated businesses whose laser refractive surgery centers
were closed and wrote-down certain product inventory to its net realizable value. We recorded a provision of
$1,100,000 in 1997 for the anticipated costs of these decisions. In 1999 we credited to income $150,000 of this accrual because actual expenses were lower than anticipated when
the accrual was established. Costs totaling $848,000 and $899,000 were charged against these accruals in 1998 and
1997, respectively. The balance of the accruals at December 31, 1999 was insignificant. 5. Credit Arrangements On June 29, 1998 we entered into an $8,000,000 credit facility with The Provident Bank Provident. At the same
time we repaid our borrowing from, and terminated our relationship with, another lender. In May 1999 the credit
facility was increased to $10,000,000. We also were granted a $10,000,000 line of credit for the purpose of funding
acquisitions. The Provident facility, as amended, matures on June 30, 2000. The facility can be used to support up to $2,000,000
of letters of credit issued by Provident and to support up to $2,500,000 of capital costs financed by leases entered
into with an affiliate of Provident. Borrowings under the working capital portion of the facility bear interest at 1/2%
above Provident prime rate or LIBOR plus 2 1/2%. We have the option to convert up to $3,500,000 of working
capital borrowings to a term loan. Substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral. The credit facility also supports letters of credit totaling $800,000 at December 31, 1999. The credit facility, for
which there is no formal compensating balance, requires us to pay a commitment fee based of 25% on the unused
portion. At December 31, 1999 we had $9,200,000 available to us under the credit facility. The credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and amounts. We are to maintain tangible net
worth of at least $45,000,000 and the ratio of our earnings before interest expense, taxes and depreciation and
amortization EBITDA on a trailing 12 months basis must be greater than 20 times the sum of our current
maturities of capital lease obligations and trailing 12 months interest expense. 6. Debt At December 31, 1998 we had a term loan borrowing under our credit facility of $2,053,000. The loan had an
interest rate of 745% and required monthly installments of $12,000 plus interest until June 30, 2000 when the
remaining principal balance of $1,705,000 would become due. In March 1999 we repaid the loan balance of
$2,030,000. We used the proceeds of the borrowing to purchase a certificate of deposit from Provident with a
maturity date of June 30, 2000. The certificate of deposit pays interest monthly at a rate of 57% per annum. The following table displays the details of debt maturing within one year dollars in thousands     December 31 1999

of $568,000. These shareholders owed us $2,100,000 which was collateralized by our obligation to them. In March
1999 we repaid the obligations due shareholders of $2,094,000 by netting the amount against the advance to
shareholders. Our principal shareholder is the majority stockholder of an inactive ambulatory surgical center. We have no
investment in this surgery center; however, we did lease a portion of our headquarters building and provided other
administrative services. During 1998 we purchased the leasehold improvements that had been paid by the surgery
center for $872,000, their book value at the time of purchase. During 1998 we also advanced $576,000 to the
surgery center. Generally accepted accounting principles required us to record a portion of the surgery center
losses using the equity method of accounting. We recorded losses of $265,000 in 1998. During 1999 we acquired
computer equipment and software from the surgery center at their book value of $103,000. The account receivable
was reduced by this amount. 8. Investment in Unconsolidated Businesses Our investment in unconsolidated businesses are comprised of the following dollars in thousands December 31 1999

The Baltimore Laser Sight Center, Ltd.
417 In July 1999, two other investees in The Baltimore Laser Sight Center, Ltd. Baltimore owning approximately
53% resigned as members and their membership interests were redeemed by Baltimore. This redemption increased
our ownership to approximately 97% which requires our combining Baltimore accounts with our accounts
beginning in the third quarter 1999. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1999 include revenue
of $4,810,000 and net income of $901,000 earned by Baltimore for the six months ended December 31, 1999.
Included in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is $234,000 which represents our percentage share of the
earnings for the six months ended June 30, 1999. Combined summary financial information for these investments follows dollars in thousands:             December 31 1999

$68 We did not record a provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes in 1998 and 1997 because of our net losses
and net loss carryforwards. We are not required to pay franchise taxes in most of the states in which we have
operations due to our net operating loss carryforwards. We have included the franchise taxes paid in general and
administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The foreign tax provisions consist primarily of Canadian income taxes. We have made no provision for U.S. income
taxes on undistributed earnings from our international businesses because it is our intention to reinvest those
earnings in those operations. If those earnings are distributed in the form of dividends, we may be subject to both
foreign withholding taxes and U.S. income taxes net of allowable foreign tax credits. Deferred taxes arise because of differences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities. Significant
components of our deferred tax assets are shown in the following table dollars in thousands         December 31 1999

$13,581 For the year ended December 31, 1999 we reassessed the realizability of our deferred tax assets. As a result of our
improving levels of and trend in profitability we concluded that realization of these deferred tax assets was more
likely than not and that the valuation allowance was no longer required. Approximately $7,625,000 of the reversal of the allowance was recorded in our Statement of Operations as an
income tax benefit. The remaining reversal, $7,442,000, was originally required because utilization of the NOL
carryforwards acquired when we bought RCII was not, at that time, more likely than not. This reversal was recorded
as a reduction of unamortized goodwill. The following table shows the principal reasons for the difference between the statutory federal income tax rate of
34% and the tax benefit shown in our Consolidated Statement of Operations dollars in thousands 1999

$68 During 1999 certain employees exercised incentive stock options and sold the shares within the holding period
required by Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. These sales result in a compensation deduction of
$2,300,000 for federal income tax purposes only. The tax benefit of approximately $891,000 has been recorded in
our Consolidated Balance Sheets as a reduction of income taxes payable and an addition to Contributed Capital. At December 31, 1999 we have net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of
$32,400,000 and $17,800,000 respectively. These expire in varying amounts from 2007 until 2022. Approximately
$18,000,000 of federal net operating loss carryforwards and $15,750,000 state net operating loss carryforwards
were acquired when we bought RCII. Our ability to use these acquired net operating loss carryforwards is limited to
approximately $2,500,000 per year under Code Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Federal and state net
operating loss carryforwards utilized in 1999 approximated $3,300,000. 10. Leasing Arrangements We lease office space for our centers and equipment for use in our operations under both capital and operating
leases. Capital leases were primarily used for financing the lasers in our first five centers; we now finance the cost
of lasers using operating leases. This table displays our aggregate minimal rental commitments under noncancellable leases for the periods shown

1997. As of December 31, 1999, the total minimum sublease rentals to be received in the future under
noncancellable operating leases was approximately $447,000. 11. Employee Benefits Savings Plan
We sponsor a savings plan under Internal Revenue Code Section 401k to provide an opportunity for eligible
employees to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Under this plan, we make discretionary contributions to
the participants' accounts. We made contributions of $20,000 in 1999, $26,000 in 1998 and none in 1997. Stock Option Plans
We have two stock incentive plans, the 1995 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan 1995 Plan and the 1998 Long
Term Stock Incentive Plan 1998. A maximum of 25 million shares are reserved for the 1995 Plan and 5 million
shares for the 1998 Plan. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the 1995 and 1998
Plans. In 1998 the Compensation Committee decided to reprice the exercise price of 973,750 stock options
previously granted to $11875 per share, the market price at the date of repricing. The Plans permit us to issue incentive and/or nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of common stock, stock
appreciation rights, and stock awards to employees and consultants. The 1998 Plan is used to grant stock options to
our non-employee directors. Non-employee directors receive an option to purchase 75,000 shares of our common
stock upon initial election or appointment and an automatic option grant of 12,500 shares upon reelection. Prior to
our shareholders approving the 1998 Plan, we granted our non-employee directors stock options under the LCA-Vision Inc. Directors' Nondiscretionary Stock Option Plan which was discontinued in 1998. Stock options are granted with an exercise price not less than fair market value on the date of grant. Stock options
granted have generally been exercisable over 3-5 years and the maximum term is 10 years from the date of grant. The table summarizes the status of our 1995 and 1998 Plans Stock Options

exercisable under this discontinued plan. We apply APB No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans. We have adopted the
disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123. We recognize no compensation expense for our stock options granted
to employees or directors. Compensation expense for options granted to non-employees in each of the three years
ended December 31, 1999 was immaterial. If we had elected to recognize compensation expense based on the fair
value at the grant dates consistent with the provisions of SFAS no. 123, net loss and loss per share would have been

LCA-Vision Inc., et al., which was commenced in October, 1997 in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York and subsequently removed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. Also named as co-defendants are various current and former employees, officers and directors. The case
involves claims and counterclaims asserted by and against us, and two other members of a New York limited
liability company formerly engaged in operating a laser refractive surgery center, and arises out of the cessation of
operations of such limited liability company. Discovery in the action has recently concluded and all parties have filed motions for summary judgment, based on
the discovery results, to dismiss all claims of the other parties. A decision on the motions will be issued by the court
in due course. In the opinion of management this action will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results
of operations. 13. Additional Financial Information
