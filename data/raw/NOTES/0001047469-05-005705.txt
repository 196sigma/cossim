Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc.      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2004    
1. The Company 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. Millennium or the Company is a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing
breakthrough products in the areas of cancer, cardiovascular disease and inflammatory disease. The Company currently has two market-leading products, one for cancer and one for cardiovascular disease
on the market. The Company also has other potential products in various stages of clinical and preclinical development in all three of its therapeutic disease areas of focus. Millennium
strategy is to develop and commercialize important new medicines through clinical trials and regulatory approvals and to play a significant role in the marketing and sale of
many of these products. The Company plans to develop and commercialize many of its products on its own, but will also seek development and commercial collaborators on favorable terms or when it would
otherwise be advantageous to the Company. 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Basis of Presentation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Millennium and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Reclassifications 
In connection with the launch of VELCADE bortezomib for Injection in May2003 and the recognition of related costs of sales, the Company
reclassified specified INTEGRILIN eptifibatide Injection related manufacturing expenses to cost of goods sold so that cost of goods sold now includes manufacturing-related expenses
associated with the sales of INTEGRILIN and VELCADE. These reclassified manufacturing-related expenses were previously included in cost of co-promotion revenue and some INTEGRILIN related
advertising and promotional expenses that were previously included in cost of co-promotion revenue have been reclassified to selling, general and administrative expenses. Prior period
amounts have been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation. There was no impact on net loss in any period. 
Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Other Investments 
Cash equivalents consist principally of money market funds and corporate bonds with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. Marketable
securities consist primarily of investment-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed debt securities and U.S. government agency debt securities. Other investments represent ownership in private companies in
which the Company holds less than a 20 percent ownership position. The Company carries such investments at the lower of cost or market unless significant influence can be exercised over the investee,
in which case such securities are recorded using the equity method. 
56  Management
determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. Marketable securities
at December31, 2004 and December31, 2003 are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair
value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported in a separate component of stockholders' equity. The cost of debt securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion are included in investment income. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be
other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities and other investments are included in investment income. The cost of securities sold is based on
the specific identification method. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in investment income. 
During
the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded realized gains on marketable securities of $19million, $63million and
$534million, respectively, and realized losses on marketable securities and other investments of $136million, $33million and $213million, respectively. 
Concentrations of Credit Risk 
Cash and cash equivalents are primarily maintained with two major financial institutions in the United States. Deposits with banks may exceed the amount of
insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of marketable securities. Marketable securities consist of investment-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed and U.S. government agency securities. The
Company investment policy, approved by the Board of Directors, limits the amount the Company may invest in any one type of investment, thereby reducing credit risk concentrations. Accounts
receivables include trade receivables which result from product sales to a few large wholesale customers and amounts due under strategic alliances. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade
receivables is limited by credit limits, ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures. 
Segment Information 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information SFAS
No131, establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in their financial statements. SFAS No131 also establishes
standards for related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. 
The
Company operates in one business segment, which focuses on the research, development and commercialization of proprietary therapeutic products. All of the Company product sales are
currently related to sales of VELCADE bortezomib for Injection. All of the Company co-promotion revenue is related to sales of INTEGRILIN eptifibatide
Injection. The remainder of the Company total revenues is related to its strategic alliances. Revenues
from Ortho Biotech Products, L.P. Ortho Biotech accounted for approximately 17percent and 11percent of consolidated revenues for the years ended
December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 
57  Revenues
from Aventis Pharmaceuticals,Inc. Aventis accounted for approximately two percent, 15percent and 12percent of consolidated revenues for the years
ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
Revenues
from Bayer, AG Bayer accounted for approximately two percent, 14percent and 22percent of consolidated revenues for the years ended December31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. 
Revenues
from Monsanto Company Monsanto accounted for approximately 12percent of consolidated revenues for the year ended December31, 2002. 
There
were no other significant customers under strategic alliances in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Information Concerning Market and Source of Supply Concentration 
INTEGRILIN eptifibatide Injection has received regulatory approvals in the United States, the countries of the European Union and a number of other
countries for various indications. The Company and Schering-PloughLtd. and Schering Corporation collectively SGP co-promote INTEGRILIN in the United States and share any
profits and losses. In the European Union, GlaxoSmithKline plc GSK exclusively markets INTEGRILIN. In addition, SGP sells INTEGRILIN in specified other areas outside of the United States and the
European Union and SGP pays the Company royalties based on these sales of INTEGRILIN. The
Company relies on third-party contract manufacturers for the clinical and commercial production of INTEGRILIN. The Company has two manufacturers that provide eptifibatide, the active
ingredient necessary to make INTEGRILIN for both clinical trials and commercial supply. Solvay, Societe Anonyme, or Solvay, one of the current manufacturers, owns the process technology used by it and
the other manufacturer for the production of bulk product. The Company plans to submit its own alternative process technology for the production of eptifibatide for approval in the United States,
Europe and other countries as required. The Company entered into an agreement with Solvay in January2003 for an initial term of four years and one-year renewal periods thereafter.
The Company has one manufacturer that currently performs fill/finish services for INTEGRILIN. The Company is qualifying a second fill/finish supplier and has identified an alternative packaging
supplier to serve as future sources of supply for the United States. The FDA or other regulatory agencies must approve the processes or the facilities that may be used for the manufacture of our
marketed products. Materials in process at these alternative suppliers are included in inventory. 
The
Company also relies on third-party contract manufacturers for the manufacturing, fill/finish and packaging of VELCADE bortezomib for Injection for both commercial
purposes and for ongoing clinical trials. The Company has established long-term supply relationships for the production of commercial supplies of VELCADE. The Company works with one
manufacturer to complete fill/finish for VELCADE. 
During
2004, the Company began distributing VELCADE in the U.S. through a sole-source distribution model where the Company sells directly to a third party who in turn
distributes to the wholesaler base. VELCADE inventory levels may fluctuate in the short-term as the Company current wholesalers familiarize themselves with new distribution logistics. 
58  Inventory 
Inventory consists of currently marketed products and from time to time, product candidates awaiting regulatory approval which were capitalized based upon
management judgment of probable near term commercialization. The Company assesses the probability of commercialization based upon several factors including estimated launch date, time to manufacture
and shelf life. At December31, 2004 and 2003, inventory does not include amounts for products that have not been approved for sale. Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost first in, first out or market. Inventories are reviewed periodically for slow-moving or obsolete status based on sales activity,
both projected and historical. 
Inventory
consists of the following in thousands: December 31, 2004
December 31, 2003 Raw materials 73,214 77,485 Work in process 8,507 3,382 Finished goods 15,553 29,346 97,274 110,213 Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Assets held under capitalized leases are stated at the present value of future minimum lease obligations. Application
development costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position SOP No98-1, Accounting for
the Costs of Computer Software Developed for Internal Use. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and are amortized over the shorter of the remaining life of the building lease or useful life.
Depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the lease as follows: Equipment
3 to 4 years Capitalized software
3 to 5 years Leasehold improvements
4 to 27 years Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
Intangible assets consist of specifically identified intangible assets. Goodwill is the excess of any purchase price over the estimated fair market value of net
tangible assets acquired not allocated to specific intangible assets. 
59  Intangible
assets consist of the following in thousands: December 31, 2004

February12, 2002, the Company acquired COR Therapeutics,Inc. COR for an aggregate purchase price of $18billion. The transaction was recorded as a purchase
for accounting purposes and the Company consolidated financial statements include COR operating results from the date of the acquisition. The purchase price was allocated, based upon an
independent valuation, to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values, with the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of net
tangible assets acquired allocated to in-process research and development, developed technology, trademark and goodwill. During
the year ended December31, 2002, the Company recorded a one-time charge of $2420million for acquired in-process research and development
representing the estimated fair value related to five incomplete projects that, at the time of the COR acquisition, had no alternative future use and for which technological feasibility had not been
established. The most significant purchased research and development project that was in-process at the date of the acquisition consisted of inhibitors of specified growth factor receptors
in the tyrosine kinase family. These inhibitors have the potential to reduce the narrowing of blood vessels. Cancers such as specified leukemias appear to harbor activated forms of some of these
receptors. This project represented 62percent of the total in-process value and was in pre-clinical testing at the time of the acquisition. The Company has advanced
this project into phase I clinical testing. The Company discontinued the remaining four of the five in-process projects as part of its restructuring efforts. 
COR
developed technology consisted of an existing product, INTEGRILIN eptifibatide Injection and related patents. This developed technology was determined to be
separable from goodwill and was valued at approximately $4350million. Because the INTEGRILIN name was well recognized in the marketplace and was considered to contribute to the product
revenue, the trademark was determined to be separable from goodwill. The INTEGRILIN trademark was valued at approximately $590million and is considered to have an indefinite life. The
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets that were not specifically
identifiable, had indeterminate lives or were inherent in the continuing business and related to the Company as a whole were classified as goodwill. The significant factors contributing to the
existence of goodwill related to company management, a specialized cardiovascular sales force, market position and operating experience. 
60  Amortization
of intangibles is computed using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the respective assets as follows: Developed technology

expense was approximately $335million, $389million and $349million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition, in connection with its
restructuring initiative discussed in Note3, the Company recognized an impairment charge in the year ended December31, 2003 of approximately $113million for technology it no
longer intends to pursue. 
The
Company expects to incur amortization expense of approximately $339million for each of the next five years. As
required by SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment, or
more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment when events
or changes in circumstances suggest that the assets may not be recoverable. The Company tests for goodwill impairment annually, on October1, and whenever events or changes in circumstances
suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
On
October1, 2004, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test and determined that no impairment existed on that date. The Company continually monitors business and
market conditions to assess whether an impairment indicator exists. If the Company were to determine that an impairment indicator exists, it would be required to perform an impairment test which might
result in a material impairment charge to the statement of operations. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The carrying amounts reported in the Company balance sheets for other current assets and long-term debt approximate their fair value. The fair
values of the Company long-term debt are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the Company current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing
arrangements. 
Revenue Recognition 
The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, co-promotion collaboration and strategic alliances. The Company revenue arrangements
with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if specified criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has stand-alone value to the customer and whether there is
objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items. The consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values, and the applicable
revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units. Advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned. 
61  Net product sales 
The Company records product sales of VELCADE bortezomib for Injection when delivery has occurred, title passes to the customer, collection is
reasonably assured and the Company has no further obligations. Allowances are recorded as a reduction to product sales for estimated returns and discounts at the time of sale. During the fourth
quarter of 2004, the Company reduced its reserve for product returns by approximately $15million based upon actual returns to date and inventory levels at the wholesalers. Costs incurred by
the Company for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales. 
Co-promotion revenue 
Co-promotion revenue includes the Company share of profits from the sale of INTEGRILIN eptifibatide Injection in
co-promotion territories by SGP. Also included in co-promotion revenue are reimbursements from SGP of the Company manufacturing-related costs, development costs, advertising
and promotional expenses associated with the sale of INTEGRILIN within co-promotion territories and royalties from SGP on sales of INTEGRILIN outside of the co-promotion
territory. The Company recognizes revenue when SGP ships INTEGRILIN to wholesalers and records it net of allowances, if any. The Company defers specified manufacturing-related expenses until the time
SGP ships related product to its customers inside and outside of co-promotion territories. Advance from Schering-Plough includes cash advances from SGP to the Company for the Company
prepayments to its manufacturers of INTEGRILIN. 
Revenue under strategic alliances 
The Company recognizes revenue from nonrefundable license payments, milestone payments, royalties and reimbursement of research and development costs.
Nonrefundable upfront fees for which no further performance obligations exist are recognized as revenue on the earlier of when payments are received or collection is assured. Nonrefundable
upfront licensing fees and guaranteed, time-based payments that require continuing involvement in the form of research and development, manufacturing or other
commercialization efforts by the Company are recognized as revenue: ratably
over the development period if development risk is significant,
ratably
over the manufacturing period or estimated product useful life if development risk has been substantially eliminated, or
based
upon the level of research services performed during the period of the research contract. Milestone
payments are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations, as defined in the contract, are achieved. Performance obligations typically consist of significant
milestones in the development life cycle of the related technology, such as initiation of clinical trials, filing for approval with regulatory agencies and approvals by regulatory agencies. 
Royalties
are recognized as revenue when earned. 
Reimbursements
of research and development costs are recognized as revenue as the related costs are incurred. 
62  
Advertising and Promotional Expenses 
Advertising and promotional expenses are expensed as incurred. During the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, advertising and promotional
expenses were $434million, $370million and $159million, respectively. 
Income Taxes 
The liability method is used to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and
income tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss carryforwards, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences reverse.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization. Specified reclassifications of prior years' amounts have been made to
the Company notes to consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. 
Net Loss Per Common Share 
Basic net loss per common share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is
typically computed using the weighted-average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares from stock options, warrants and convertible debt using the treasury stock method. However, for all
periods presented, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share as the inclusion of weighted-average shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options, warrants
and convertible debt would be antidilutive. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
The financial statements of the Company foreign subsidiary are measured using the local currency as the functional currency, with results of operations and cash
flows translated at average exchange rates during the period, and assets and liabilities translated at end of period exchange rates. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the
results of operations and are not material to the Company consolidated financial statements. Translation adjustments are excluded from the determination of net loss and are accumulated in a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders' equity. Comprehensive Loss 
Comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities and cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments.
Accumulated other comprehensive income as of December31, 2004 and 2003 included unrealized losses of $54million and unrealized gains of $49million, respectively, on
marketable securities and $06 million $003 million, respectively, of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments. Comprehensive loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of
stockholders' equity. 
63  Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company follows the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and
related interpretations, in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans, rather than the alternative fair value accounting method provided for under SFAS No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No123, as amended by SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-based CompensationTransition and Disclosure, SFAS No148. Under
APB 25, when the exercise price of options granted equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force EITF 96-18, the Company records compensation expense equal to the fair value of options granted to non-employees over the vesting period, which is generally the
period of service. 
The
following information regarding net loss and net loss per share has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options and employee stock plan under the
fair value method prescribed by SFAS No123, as amended by SFAS No148. The resulting effect on net loss and net loss per share pursuant to SFAS No123 is not likely to be
representative of the effects in future periods, due to subsequent additional option grants and periods of vesting. The
following table illustrates the effect on net loss and loss per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123 to stock-based employee
compensation in thousands, except per share amounts: Year Ended December 31 2004
2003

weighted-average per share fair value of options granted during 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $839, $751 and $1081, respectively. 
64  The
fair value of stock options and common stock issued pursuant to the stock option and stock purchase plans at the date of grant were estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the
following weighted-average assumptions: Stock Options

87 The
Black-Scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Option valuation models
require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. The Company employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options and changes in the subjective inputs assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. 
Through
the end of the second quarter of 2004, the fair value of stock options granted was determined utilizing a historical volatility rate. In the third quarter of 2004, the Company
reevaluated and subsequently changed its expected volatility assumption. The Company now uses the most recent three-year time period for purposes of calculating the expected volatility.
Additionally, the Company considered implied volatilities of currently traded options to provide an estimate based upon current trading activity. After considering other such factors as its stage of
development, the length of time the Company has been public and the impact of having two marketed products, the Company believes this volatility rate better reflects the expected volatility of its
stock going forward. 
The
Company has never declared cash dividends on any of its capital stock and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. Accounting Pronouncements 
In January2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No51 FIN 46 and in December2003 issued a revised FIN 46 FIN 46R which addressed the period of adoption of FIN 46 for entities
created before January31, 2003. FIN 46 provides a new consolidation model which determines control and consolidation based on potential variability in gains and losses. The provisions of FIN
46 are effective for enterprises with variable interests in variable interest entities created after January31, 2003. For its interests in variable interest entities created before
February1, 2003, the Company adopted FIN 46 in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial position or results of
operations. 
In
May2003, the FASB issued SFAS No150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity SFAS No150. SFAS
No150 establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and
equity. SFAS No150 is effective for all financial instruments created or modified after May31, 2003, and otherwise effective at the beginning of the 
65  first
interim period beginning after June15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No150 did not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Company. 
In
December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123R revised 2004, Share-Based PaymentAn Amendment of FASB Statements No123 and 95 SFAS
No123R. SFAS No123R requires companies to calculate and record in the income statement the cost of equity instruments, such as stock options or restricted stock, awarded to
employees for services received. The cost of the equity instrument is to be measured based on the fair value of the instruments on the date they are granted and is required to be recognized over the
period during which the employees are required to provide services in exchange for the equity instruments. SFAS No123R is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning
after June15, 2005. 
SFAS
No123R provides two alternatives for adoption: a
modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted subsequent to the effective date of the statement as well as for the unvested
portion of awards outstanding as of the effective date; or
a
modified retrospective method which follows the approach in the modified prospective method, but also permits entities to restate prior periods to record compensation
cost calculated under SFAS No123 for pro forma disclosure. The
Company plans to adopt SFAS No123R using the modified prospective method. As permitted by SFAS No123, the Company currently accounts for share-based payments to
employees using APB 25 intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No123R fair value method
will have a significant impact on the Company result of operations, although it will have no impact on its overall financial position. The Company cannot accurately estimate at this time the impact
of adopting SFAS No123R as it will depend on market price, assumptions used and levels of share-based payments granted in future periods. However, had the Company adopted SFAS No123R
in a prior period, the impact would
approximate the impact of SFAS No123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note2 above. 
3. Restructuring 
In December2002 and June2003, the Company took steps to realign its resources to become a commercially-focused biopharmaceutical company. The
Company discontinued specified discovery research efforts, reduced overall headcount, primarily in its discovery group and consolidated its research and development facilities. As of
December1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities SFAS No146. SFAS No146 requires that a
liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred, except for
one-time termination benefits that meet specified requirements. These actions resulted in the recognition of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2002 and the years ended 2003
and 2004. During 2005, the Company may recognize additional restructuring charges for adjustments to the estimates of the remaining rental obligations, net of estimated sublease income, for facilities
vacated. 
66  These
costs are included in restructuring in the statements of operations and other current and other long term liabilities on the balance sheet at December31, 2004. The

projected payments of the remaining balances of the restructuring charges for the year ended December31, 2004 are approximately $342million in 2005 and
$398million thereafter through 2022. 
Costs
of termination benefits relate to severance packages, out-placement services and career counseling for employees affected by the restructuring. Charges related to
facilities include estimated remaining rental obligations, net of estimated sublease income, for facilities that the Company no longer occupies. Included in Other facilities charges is the
write-off of deferred rent recorded in accordance with SFAS No13, Accounting for Leases. The Company decisions to vacate specified facilities and abandon the related leasehold
improvements as well as terminate specified research programs were deemed to be impairment indicators under SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets. As a result of performing the impairment evaluations, asset impairment charges were recorded to adjust the carrying value of the related long-lived assets to their net realizable
values. The fair values of the assets were estimated based upon anticipated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. 
67  
4. COR Acquisition 
On February12, 2002, the Company acquired COR for an aggregate purchase price of $18billion, primarily consisting of 551million shares
of Millennium common stock pursuant to the merger agreement between the Company and COR. Through the merger, the Company added approximately 300 new employees and a leased facility in South San
Francisco, California and acquired INTEGRILIN eptifibatide Injection for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes and substantial research capabilities in the areas of cardiovascular
disease and oncology. The purchase price calculation was based on COR outstanding common stock at February12, 2002 using the conversion ratio of 09873 of a share of Millennium common stock
for each share of outstanding COR common stock. In addition, options to purchase approximately 62million shares of COR common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $1290 were
assumed by Millennium pursuant to the merger agreement and converted into options to purchase approximately 61million shares of Millennium common stock. The
total cost of the merger was determined as follows in thousands, except per share: Fair value of Millennium shares calculated using $3057 per share average fair value for the three days prior to and after announcement of the merger 1,685,334 Value of COR options assumed net of intrinsic value of unvested options 127,714 Millennium transaction costs, consisting primarily of financial advisory, legal and accounting fees 20,281 1,833,329 The
fair value of options assumed was determined using the Black-Scholes method assuming expected lives ranging from one to five years, a risk-free interest rate of 435 volatility of 8688% and no expected dividends. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No44, or FIN 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensationan
Interpretation of APB 25, a portion of the intrinsic value of unvested options of COR has been allocated to deferred stock compensation. Deferred stock compensation was amortized on a
straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period of the related options and was fully amortized as of December2004. The
transaction was recorded as a purchase for accounting purposes and the Company consolidated financial statements include COR operating results from the date of the acquisition.
The purchase price was allocated to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values, with the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net
tangible assets allocated to specific intangible assets and goodwill as follows in thousands: Net tangible assets acquired 37,585 In-process research and development 242,000 Identifiable intangible assets primarily developed technology13 year useful life and trademarkindefinite life 494,000 Goodwill 1,059,744 1,833,329 68 
5. Revenue and Strategic Alliances 
The Company has entered into research, development, technology transfer and commercialization arrangements with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
relating to a broad range of
therapeutic products. These alliances provide the Company with the opportunity to receive various combinations of license fees, research funding, co-promotion revenue, distribution fees
and may provide additional payments contingent upon its achievement of research and regulatory milestones and royalties and/or profit shares if the Company collaborations are successful in
developing and commercializing products. 
Product Alliances 
On June30, 2003, the Company entered into an agreement with Ortho Biotech, a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson Johnson, to collaborate on the
commercialization and continued clinical development of VELCADE bortezomib for Injection. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company retains all commercialization rights to VELCADE
in the United States. Ortho Biotech and its affiliate, Janssen-Cilag, have agreed to commercialize VELCADE outside of the United States. The Company is entitled to royalties in the form of
distribution fees from Ortho Biotech and its affiliate on sales of VELCADE outside of the United States. The Company also retains an option to co-promote VELCADE with Ortho Biotech at a
future date in specified European countries. 
The
Company and Ortho Biotech and its research affiliate, Johnson Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Development, L.L.C., are jointly engaged in an extensive global
program for further clinical development of VELCADE. This program is investigating the potential of VELCADE to treat multiple forms of solid and hematological cancers, including continued clinical
development of VELCADE for multiple myeloma. Ortho Biotech is responsible for 40% of the joint development costs through 2005 and for 45% of such costs thereafter. In
connection with the agreement, the Company received a nonrefundable payment from Ortho Biotech of $150million in July2003. In addition, the Company may receive
payments for achieving clinical development milestones, for achieving regulatory milestones outside of the United States and for achieving agreed-upon sales levels of VELCADE. The Company
may also receive additional payments for achieving specified clinical and regulatory approval milestones outside of the United States for additional solid and hematological cancers and for achieving
sales milestones outside of the United States. During the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, the Company recognized approximately $540million and $330million,
respectively, of milestone payments as revenue under this alliance. 
In
April1999, COR entered into a collaboration agreement with SGP to jointly develop and commercialize INTEGRILIN eptifibatide Injection on a worldwide basis. The
Company acquired COR in February2002. Under its collaboration agreement with SGP, the Company generally shares any profits or losses from the sale of INTEGRILIN in the United States with SGP
based on the amount of promotional efforts that each party contributes. Since the United States launch of INTEGRILIN in June1998, the Company and SGP have agreed to share promotional efforts
in the United States equally, except for costs associated with marketing programs that are specific to the
Company. The Company has granted SGP an exclusive license to market INTEGRILIN outside of the United States and European Union, and SGP pays the Company royalties based those sales. 
During
September2004, the Company initiated the process, contemplated by the original agreement with SGP, to transition U.S. distribution responsibilities for INTEGRILIN from SGP
to the 
69  Company.
The Company expects this transition to take place during the fourth quarter of 2005, at the earliest. In
June2004, the Company reacquired the rights to market INTEGRILIN eptifibatide Injection in Europe from SGP and concurrently entered into a license agreement
granting GSK exclusive marketing rights to INTEGRILIN in Europe. In January2005, the transition of the INTEGRILIN marketing authorization for the European Union from SGP to GSK was completed
and GSK began selling INTEGRILIN in the countries of the European Union. The commercialization alliance is designed to provide significant sales and marketing support to address market opportunities
for INTEGRILIN in Europe. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is entitled to license fees and royalties from GSK on INTEGRILIN sales in Europe upon the achievement of specified objectives. Through
its merger with LeukoSite,Inc. LeukoSite in 1999, the Company became a party to a joint venture agreement with ILEX Products,Inc. ILEX to form Millennium
and ILEX Partners, L.P. MI for the purpose of developing and commercializing Campath alemtuzumab humanized monoclonal antibody for use in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic
leukemia. The Company accounted for its investment in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. On December31, 2001, ILEX Oncology acquired the Company equity interest in MI
which owns the Campath product in exchange for $200million plus additional consideration contingent upon future sales of Campath. The Company earned $400million of such consideration
in each of 2004, 2003 and 2002. In addition, the Company may be entitled to additional payments from ILEX Oncology based on future U.S. sales of Campath. 
In
January2005, the Company repaid SGP approximately $493million for advances SGP had made for inventory purchases in prior years. This amount is included in Advance
from Schering-Plough in current liabilities at December31, 2004.  Research and Discovery Alliances  On March9, 2001, the Company entered into a strategic alliance with Abbott Laboratories Abbott for a five-year term in the area of
metabolic diseases. The Company and Abbott agreed to share the cost of developing, manufacturing and marketing products on a worldwide basis. This arrangement with Abbott also included a technology
exchange and development agreement and a $2500million equity investment agreement. As part of this $2500million equity investment agreement, Abbott made investments in 2002 and 2001
totaling $2214million. Abbott made the remaining $286million investment in March2003. 
On
August8, 2003, the Company and Abbott agreed to terminate their alliance covering joint discovery, development and commercialization of metabolic disease products in
connection with the Company June2003 restructuring plan. Included in restructuring charges for the three months ended September30, 2003 are restructuring charges specifically related
to the discontinuation of metabolic research and development, which include termination benefits and costs associated with the Abbott separation agreement. 
On
June22, 2000, the Company entered into an alliance with Aventis, the pharmaceutical company of Aventis S.A., covering the joint development and commercialization of drugs for
the treatment of inflammatory diseases; joint development of new drug discovery technologies; transfer of 
70  key
elements of the Company technology platform to Aventis to enhance its existing capabilities; and purchase of an equity interest in the Company by Aventis. The companies have agreed to share the
responsibility for and cost of developing, marketing and manufacturing products arising from the alliance, as well as profits in North America. Outside of North America, Aventis is responsible for
developing and marketing products arising from the alliance, with a royalty obligation to the Company. Under a Technology Transfer Agreement, the Company agreed to provide Aventis with rights to its
drug discovery technologies in exchange for payments between $1600million and $2000million over a three to five-year period. Aventis has purchased $2500million
of the Company common stock as agreed under an Investment Agreement with the Company. 
On
April22, 2003, Aventis exercised its option to terminate the Technology Transfer Agreement between the Company and Aventis effective on the third anniversary of the Agreement,
July21, 2003. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, upon providing this notice to the Company, Aventis paid the Company $400million in consideration for future use of specified
Millennium technology transferred to Aventis, which is included in revenue under strategic alliances for the year ended December31, 2003. 
On
October31, 2003, the research phase of the Company five year strategic alliance with Bayer concluded. On October10, 2003, Bayer and Millennium amended the agreement
to provide both parties access to specified identified drug targets for a period of seven years. If Bayer successfully develops and commercializes any of these targets discovered in the alliance,
Bayer may make success payments and royalties to Millennium on the sale of products generated from the alliance. Revenues
recognized under the research phase of the Bayer alliance were approximately $455million and $601million for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The Company recognized the research funding portion of the alliance on a percentage-of-completion basis. The percentage-of-completion was
determined at each measurement date based upon the actual full-time equivalents to date as compared to management estimate of the total full-time equivalents needed to
complete the deliverables required by the alliance. In September2001, the Company revised the estimate of total full-time equivalents required to complete the project downward as a
result of productivity improvements made at the Company and changes to the program requirements made by Bayer. During each subsequent reporting period, the Company continued to monitor the
full-time equivalent estimate necessary to complete the deliverables and compared the estimate to the actual effort put forth. No further adjustments were necessary and the accounting
estimates used approximated actual efforts from September2001 to the end of the research phase of the agreement, October31, 2003.

aggregate fair value of investments in an unrealized loss position for less than a year was approximately $5710million at December31, 2004. The
aggregated fair value of investments in an unrealized loss position for greater than a year was approximately $233million at December31, 2004. The aggregated fair value of investments
with unrealized losses was approximately $1776million at December31, 2003. All such investments were in an unrealized loss position for less than a year at December31, 2003. 
The
Company reviews investments in corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and government agency securities for other-than-temporary impairment whenever the fair
value of an investment is less than amortized cost and evidence indicates that an investment carrying amount is not recoverable within a reasonable period of time. Investments in an unrealized loss
position for greater than a year 
72 
were
comprised of corporate bonds and U.S. government agency securities. The unrealized losses were due to fluctuations in interest rates. To determine whether an impairment is
other-than-temporary, the Company considers whether it has the ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price recovery and considers whether evidence indicating
the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, compliance with the Company investment
policy, the severity and the duration of the impairment and changes in value subsequent to year end. The Company has reviewed those securities with unrealized losses as of December31, 2004 and
2003 and has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment existed as of December31, 2004 and 2003.

provision for income taxes, and actual tax is reconciled in the following chart $ in thousands: 2004
2003
2002 Loss before provision for income taxes 252,297 483,687 590,193 Expected tax benefit at 35 88,304 169,290 206,568 Write off of purchased research and development 84,700 Change in valuation allowance for deferred tax assets allocated to tax expense 85,947 164,904 119,602 Other permanent items 2,357 4,386 2,266 Income tax provision At
December31, 2004, the Company had unused net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $13 billion available to reduce federal taxable income expiring in 2005 through
2024 and $10billion available to reduce state taxable income expiring in 2005 through 2009. The Company also has federal and net state research tax credits of approximately
$923million available to offset federal and state income taxes, both of which expire beginning in 2005. Due to the degree of uncertainty related to the ultimate use of the loss carryforwards
and tax credits, the Company has fully reserved these tax benefits. 
Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company deferred tax assets as of December31 are as follows $ in thousands: 2004
2003
2002 Net operating loss carryforwards 496,427 473,123 443,776 Research and development tax credit carryforwards 92,270 84,912 78,823 Capitalized research costs 349,970 275,303 185,521 Property and other intangible assets 74,620 71,458 31,340 Deferred revenue 26,631 40,930 53,677 Accrued restructuring 27,577 31,274 1,117 Unrealized loss on marketable securities 2,149 851 Other 23,711 15,740 19,824 Total deferred tax assets 1,093,355 992,740 814,929 Valuation allowance 934,236 819,003 629,041 Total deferred tax assets 159,119 173,737 185,888 Deferred tax liability Intangible assets 159,119 172,504 185,888 Unrealized gain loss on marketable securities 1,233 Net deferred tax asset 79 
The
valuation allowance increased by $1152million during 2004 due primarily to net operating loss carryforwards from operations and stock options exercises, as well as a net
increase in temporary items arising from timing differences of costs for financial accounting and tax purposes especially for capitalized research costs and amortized intangible costs. The valuation
allowance increased by $1899million during 2003 due primarily to the increase in net operating loss carryforwards from operations and stock option exercises as well as a net increase in
temporary items arising from differences of costs for financial accounting and tax purposes especially for capitalized research costs, fixed assets, and restructuring costs. The deferred tax assets
acquired from COR, LeukoSite and ChemGenics are subject to review and possible adjustments by the Internal Revenue Service and may be limited due to the change in ownership provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code. 
Any
subsequently recognized tax benefits relating to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December31, 2004 would be allocated as follows in thousands: Reported in the statement of operations 666,426 Reported as a decrease to goodwill 15,922 Reported in additional paid-in capital 251,888 Total valuation allowance 934,236 13. Related Party Transactions 
In November2003, the Company sold specified assets, including intellectual property to Portola Pharmaceuticals,Inc. Portola, a company founded
and owned in part by a member of Millennium board of directors. In exchange for these assets, the Company received Portola SeriesA preferred convertible stock, representing less than a 5%
ownership in Portola. The investment in Portola is accounted for using the cost method and is included in other long term assets on the balance sheet at December31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. In addition, commencing in June2004, Portola sub-leased specified research facilities of the Company in South San Francisco, CA. The Company believes these lease
terms are comparable to those that would be available from unaffiliated third parties. In August2004, the Company entered into an additional transaction with Portola to license the Company
Factor Xa inhibitor program in return for milestone and royalty payments upon achievement of certain events. 
14. Subsequent Events unaudited 
In February 2005, the Company achieved specified objectives under its collaborations with GSK and Ortho Biotech. Under its collaborations with GSK, the Company
will recognize $199million throughout the remainder of 2005 as a result of the successful transfer of the central marketing authorization of INTEGRILIN eptifibatide Injection
in Europe to GSK and related activities. 
Under
its collaboration with Ortho Biotech, the Company will recognize milestone payments of $200million in the first quarter of 2005 as a result of the achievement of specified
sales levels of VELCADE bortezomib for Injection outside of the United States and worldwide.
