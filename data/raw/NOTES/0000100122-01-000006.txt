ITEM 8. - CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
- 
See Item 14, page 98, for a list of the Consolidated Financial
Statements that are included in the following pages. See Note 18 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Report of Independent Accountants To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
UniSource Energy Corporation and to the
Board of Directors and Stockholder of
Tucson Electric Power Company In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
statements of capitalization and the related consolidated statements
of income, of cash flows, and of changes in stockholders' equity
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
UniSource Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries the Company and
Tucson Electric Power Company and its subsidiaries TEP at December
31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company and TEP management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America, which require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- 
NOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- 
NATURE OF OPERATIONS
UniSource Energy Corporation UniSource Energy is an exempt holding
company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act. UniSource Energy has no
significant operations of its own, but holds the stock of Tucson Electric
Power Company TEP and Millennium Energy Holdings, Inc. Millennium. TEP, a
regulated public utility incorporated in Arizona since 1963, is UniSource
Energy largest operating subsidiary and represents substantially all of
UniSource Energy assets. Millennium holds the energy-related businesses
described in Note 4.
TEP generates, transmits and distributes electricity. TEP serves retail
customers in a 1,155 square mile area in Southern Arizona. TEP also sells
electricity to other utilities and power marketing entities primarily located
in the Western United States. Approximately 60% of TEP work force is
subject to a collective bargaining unit. The collective bargaining agreement
in place at December 31, 2000 terminates on January 6, 2003.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
On January 1, 1998, TEP and UniSource Energy exchanged all the
outstanding common stock of TEP on a share-for-share basis for the common
stock of UniSource Energy. Following the share exchange, in January 1998 TEP
transferred the stock of Millennium to UniSource Energy for a $95 million ten-
year promissory note from UniSource Energy. Approximately $25 million of this
note represents a gain to TEP. TEP has not recorded this gain. Instead, this
gain will be reflected as an increase in TEP common stock equity when
UniSource Energy pays the principal portion of the note in 2008. In
accordance with the Arizona Corporation Commission ACC order authorizing the
formation of the holding company, the note bears interest at 978% payable
every two years beginning January 1, 2000. UniSource Energy paid TEP $9
million in 2000 and $19 million in 1999 for the interest owed under this note.
UniSource Energy and TEP use the following three methods to report
investments in their subsidiaries or other companies - Consolidation: When we own a majority of the voting stock of a subsidiary,
we combine the accounts of the subsidiary with our accounts. We eliminate
intercompany balances and transactions when we combine these accounts.
- The Equity Method: We use the equity method to report corporate joint
ventures, partnerships, and affiliated companies when we hold a 20% to 50%
voting interest or we have the ability to exercise significant influence over
the operating and financial policies of the investee company. Under the
equity method, we report  - Our interest in the equity of an entity as an investment on our balance
sheet; and
- Our percentage share of the net income loss from the entity as other
income in our income statements.
- The Cost Method: We use the cost method when we hold less than a 20% voting
interest in an investment and do not have the ability to exercise significant
influence in an investment. Under the cost method, we report our investment
at cost on our balance sheet, and we record dividends received as other
income in our income statements.
USE OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Management makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial
statements under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP. These
estimates and assumptions affect   - A portion of the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates
of the financial statements  - Our disclosures regarding contingent assets and liabilities at the dates
of the financial statements; and
- A portion of the reported revenues and expenses during the financial
statement reporting periods.
Because these estimates involve judgments, the actual amounts may differ from
the estimates.
REGULATION
The ACC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC regulate
portions of TEP utility accounting practices and electricity rates. The ACC
has authority over certain rates charged to retail customers, the issuance of
securities, and transactions with affiliated parties. The FERC regulates
TEP rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services. TEP
generally uses the same accounting policies and practices used by unregulated
companies for financial reporting under GAAP. However, sometimes these
principles, such as FAS 71, require special accounting treatment for regulated
companies to show the effect of regulation. These effects are described in
Note 2.
TEP UTILITY PLANT
We report TEP utility plant on our balance sheets at its original cost.
Utility plant includes - Material and labor,
- Contractor costs,
- Construction overhead costs where applicable, and
- An Allowance for Funds Used During Construction AFUDC or capitalized
interest.
AFUDC reflects the cost of financing construction projects with borrowed funds
and equity funds. The component of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds is
included as a reduction of Other Interest Expense on the income statement.
The equity component is included in Other Income Deductions. In 2000, 1999
and 1998, we imputed the cost of capital on construction expenditures at an
average of 764%, 704% and 630%, respectively, to reflect the cost of using
borrowed and equity funds to finance construction.
On November 1, 1999, after we stopped applying FAS 71 to our generation
operations, we began applying Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
34, Capitalization of Interest Cost. FAS 34 replaces the previous AFUDC
calculation for generation-related construction projects and provides guidance
on calculating the costs during construction of debt funds used to finance
these projects. The capitalized interest on our generation-related
construction projects is included as a reduction of Other Interest Expense on
the income statement. The average capitalized interest rate applied to
generation-related construction expenditures was 558% in 2000.
Depreciation
We compute depreciation for owned utility plant on a straight-line basis
at rates based on the economic lives of the assets. These rates are approved
by the ACC and averaged 385%, 368% and 353% in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. The economic lives for generation plant are based on remaining
lives. The economic lives for transmission plant, distribution plant, general
plant and intangible plant are based on average lives. The rates also reflect
estimated removal costs, net of estimated salvage value. The costs of planned
major maintenance activities are accounted for as the costs are actually
incurred and are not accrued in advance of the planned maintenance. Planned
major maintenance activities include the scheduled overhauls at our generation
plants. Minor replacements and repairs are expensed as incurred. Retirements
of utility plant, together with removal costs less salvage, are charged to
accumulated depreciation.
MILLENNIUM PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT
Millennium properties and equipment are included, net of accumulated
depreciation, in UniSource Energy balance sheets in the Investments and
Other Property line item. Properties and equipment are stated at cost and are
depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to expense,
while major renewals and betterments are capitalized.
Interest is capitalized in connection with the construction of major
equipment at Global Solar. The capitalized interest is recorded as part of the
asset to which it relates and is depreciated over the asset estimated useful
life.
TEP UTILITY PLANT UNDER CAPITAL LEASES
TEP financed the following generation assets with leases - Springerville Common Facilities,
- Springerville Unit 1,
- Springerville Coal Handling Facilities, and
- Irvington Unit 4.
Under GAAP, these leases qualify as capital leases. However, for ACC
rate-making purposes, these leases have been treated as operating leases with
recovery as if rent payments were made in equal amounts annually during the
lease term. We recorded lease expense interest and depreciation on a basis
which reflected the rate-making treatment for periods prior to November 1,
1999, the date our generation operations became deregulated. We deferred the
differences between GAAP capital lease accounting used by unregulated
companies and the ACC rate-making method used by us prior to November 1, 1999.
See Deferred Lease Expense and Income Statement Impact of Applying FAS 71 in
Note 2. We describe the lease terms in Capital Lease Obligations in Note 7.
The following table shows the amount of lease expense incurred for TEP

LONG-TERM DEBT
We defer all costs related to the issuance of long-term debt. These
costs include underwriters' commissions, discounts or premiums, and other
costs such as legal, accounting and regulatory fees and printing costs. We
amortize these costs over the life of the debt.
Prior to November 1, 1999, gains and losses on debt that we retired
before maturity were amortized over the remaining original life of the debt to
interest expense. Effective November 1, 1999, we recognize gains and losses
on reacquired debt associated with the generation portion of TEP operations
as incurred. We reclassified any remaining generation-related unamortized
gains and losses on reacquired debt at November 1, 1999, which had been
included in Other Regulatory Assets in our balance sheets, to the Transition
Recovery Asset. See Note 2. We continue to defer and amortize the gains and
losses on reacquired debt associated with TEP regulated operations to
interest income or expense over the remaining life of the original debt.
ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATING REVENUES
We record electric utility operating revenues when we deliver electricity
to customers. Operating revenues include unbilled revenues which are earned
service has been provided but not billed by the end of an accounting period.
We record an expense and reduce accounts receivable by an Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts for revenue amounts that we estimate will become
uncollectible. See Note 11 for further discussion of TEP wholesale accounts
receivable and allowances.
REVENUE FROM LONG-TERM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS
Because of the consolidation of Global Solar, effective June 1, 2000,
Global Solar long-term contract revenues of $3 million in 2000 are included
in Other Operating Revenues on the UniSource Energy income statements. Global
Solar recognized long-term contract revenue of $4 million and $1 million in
1999 and 1998, respectively. Global Solar derives most of its revenue from
funding received under research and development contracts with various U.S.
governmental agencies. Revenues under long-term contracts are accounted for
under the percentage of completion method and include cost reimbursement, cost
plus fixed fee and fixed fee contracts. Revenues on these contracts are
recognized as follows  - Cost Reimbursement Contracts - Revenue is recognized as costs are
incurred  - Cost Plus Fixed Fee Contracts - Revenues are recognized using the
percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs
incurred to date to total contract costs; and
- Fixed Fee Contracts - Revenues are recognized when applicable milestones
are met.
Contract costs include both direct and indirect costs.
FUEL COSTS
Fuel inventory, primarily coal, is recorded at weighted average cost. TEP
uses full absorption costing. Under full absorption costing, all costs
incurred in the production process are included in the cost of the inventory.
Examples of these costs are direct material, direct labor and overhead costs.
INCOME TAXES
We are required by GAAP to report some of our assets and liabilities
differently for our financial statements than we do for income tax purposes.
The tax effects of differences in these items are reported as deferred income
tax assets or liabilities in our balance sheets. We measure these assets and
liabilities using income tax rates that are currently in effect.
See Note 2 for discussion of the following income tax items  - Income Taxes Recoverable Through Future Revenues
- Deferred Investment Tax Credits Regulatory Liability
We allocate income taxes to the subsidiaries based on their taxable
income and deductions used in the consolidated tax return.
EMISSION ALLOWANCES
Emission Allowances are issued by the EPA and each permits emission of
one ton of sulfur dioxide. These allowances can be bought or sold. Prior to
November 1, 1999, based on expected future regulatory treatment, TEP recorded
Emission Allowance purchases in a noncurrent inventory account included in
Investments and Other Property on the balance sheets. Emission allowance
inventory was recorded at weighted average cost. Gains on sales of Emission
Allowances were deferred as an Emission Allowance Gain Regulatory Liability in
the balance sheets. At November 1, 1999, the Emission Allowance inventory
account and the Emission Allowance Gain Regulatory Liability were written off
and the result was included in Extraordinary Income in the income statements
in accordance with the provisions of FAS 101. See Note 2. Subsequent to
November 1, 1999, TEP Emission Allowances have a zero book value. In 2000,
a portion of TEP Emission Allowances were utilized to comply with
environmental regulations. See Note 10.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 FAS 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. We were required to comply
with FAS 133 effective January 1, 2001. See Note 3 for further discussion of
our accounting for derivatives and hedging activities.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
We have made reclassifications to the prior year financial statements for
comparative purposes. These reclassifications had no effect on net income. NOTE 2. REGULATORY MATTERS
-    TEP generally uses the same accounting policies and practices used by
unregulated companies for financial reporting under GAAP. However, sometimes
these principles, such as FAS 71, require special accounting treatment for
regulated companies to show the effect of regulation. For example, in setting
TEP retail rates, the ACC may not allow TEP to currently charge its
customers to recover certain expenses, but instead requires that these
expenses be charged to customers in the future. In this situation, FAS 71
requires that TEP defer these items and show them as regulatory assets on the
balance sheet until TEP is allowed to charge its customers. TEP then
amortizes these items as expense to the income statement as those charges are
recovered from customers. Similarly, certain revenue items may be deferred as
regulatory liabilities, which are also eventually amortized to the income
statement as rates to customers are reduced.
The conditions a regulated company must satisfy to apply the accounting
policies and practices of FAS 71 include  - an independent regulator sets rates  - the regulator sets the rates to cover specific costs of delivering
service; and
- the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below
the rates set by the regulator.
The financial statement impact of applying FAS 71 changed between 1998
and 1999 due to a change in the way we are regulated. The following sections
of this note explain the chronology of events and the impact on our financial
statements.
REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 1998
TEP applied FAS 71 to the generation, transmission and distribution
portions of its business during 1998. The regulatory assets and liabilities
at December 31, 1998 were  
- Millions of Dollars -
Regulatory Assets
Income Taxes Recoverable Through Future Revenues   $ 152
Deferred Springerville Generation Costs         102
Deferred Lease Expense                  10
Other Regulatory Assets                 19
Springerville Unit 1 Allowance-contra-asset      171
Total Regulatory Assets               $ 112
Regulatory Liabilities
Deferred Investment Tax Credits Regulatory Liability $ 10
Emission Allowance Gain Regulatory Liability       31
Total Regulatory Liabilities            $ 41
A description of these assets and liabilities follows Income Taxes Recoverable Through Future Revenues: Represents the portion of
the total deferred income tax liability attributable to our utility business
for which we have not charged our customers. This balance was amortized as
the temporary differences reversed. Effective November 1, 1999, the
generation-related portion of this balance became part of the Transition
Recovery Asset.
Deferred Springerville Generation Costs: Represented deferred costs related to
Springerville Generating Station operations, including - Springerville Common Facilities costs incurred between the in-service dates
of Springerville Unit 1 and Springerville Unit 2. We were amortizing these
costs over the initial term of the Common Facilities Leases 2017 and 2021 - Fees incurred in 1997 to renegotiate the Springerville coal supply
contract. These fees were being amortized over the life of the new contract
2010; and
- Non-fuel costs of Springerville Unit 2 incurred from January 1, 1991
through October 14, 1991 which were amortized over a three-year period from
1996 through 1999.
Deferred Lease Expense: Represented differences which arose as a result of the
ACC regulatory treatment of TEP capital leases. The ACC treated these
leases as operating leases for ratemaking purposes, resulting in deferral of
certain lease and interest costs.
Springerville Unit 1 Allowance: This allowance represented the portion of
Springerville Unit 1 non-fuel expenses that the ACC did not allow TEP to
recover through retail rates. The allowance, a contra-asset account,
increased by interest expense which was shown as Interest Imputed on Losses
Recorded at Present Value in the Interest Expense section in the income
statements and decreased by the Amortization of Springerville Unit 1
Allowance, which was a contra-expense included in Operating Expenses.
At November 1, 1999, the unamortized balance of the Springerville Unit 1
Allowance reduced the Springerville Unit 1 capital lease asset amount. This
offset reduced the amount of post-FAS 71 Springerville Unit 1 lease
depreciation expense that will be recognized in the income statements and
eliminated any further interest and amortization expense related to the
Springerville Unit 1 Allowance.
Deferred Investment Tax Credits Regulatory Liability: Represented the deferred
benefit relating to ITC claimed on tax returns. This amount was being
amortized over the tax lives of the related property.
Emission Allowance Gain Regulatory Liability: Represented the net deferred
gain on emission allowance sales. These gains would have been amortized as
the remaining emission allowance inventory was used.
NOVEMBER 1999 ACC APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
The Settlement Agreement
In November 1999, the ACC approved a Settlement Agreement between TEP and
certain customer groups relating to recovery of TEP transition costs and
standard retail rates. The major provisions of the Settlement Agreement, as
approved, were - Consumer choice: Consumer choice for energy supply began in January 2000
and by January 1, 2001 consumer choice was available to all customers.
- Rate freeze: In accordance with the Rate Settlement approved by the ACC in
1998, TEP decreased rates to retail customers by 11% on July 1, 1998, 1% on
July 1, 1999 and 1% on July 1, 2000. These reductions applied to all retail
customers except for certain customers that have negotiated non-standard
rates. The Settlement Agreement provides that, after these reductions, TEP
retail rates will be frozen until December 31, 2008, except under certain
circumstances. TEP expects to recover the costs of transmission and
distribution under regulated unbundled rates both during and after the rate
freeze.
- Recovery of transition costs: TEP frozen rates include Fixed and Floating
Competition Transition Charge CTC components designated for the recovery of
transition costs, including generation-related regulatory assets and a portion
of TEP generation plant assets. Retail rates will decrease by the Fixed CTC
amount after TEP has recovered $450 million or on December 31, 2008, whichever
occurs first. The Floating CTC equals the amount of the frozen retail rate
less the price of retail electric service. The price of retail electric
service includes TEP transmission and distribution charge and a market
energy component based on the Palo Verde Futures Index for electric energy.
Because TEP total retail rate will be frozen, the Floating CTC is expected
to allow TEP to recoup the balance of transition recovery assets not otherwise
recovered through the Fixed CTC. The Floating CTC will end no later than
December 31, 2008.
- By June 1, 2004, TEP will be required to file a general rate case including
an updated cost-of-service study. Any rate change resulting from this rate
case would be effective no sooner than June 1, 2005 and would not result in a
net rate increase.
In accordance with the Settlement Agreement, TEP will transfer its
generation and other competitive assets to a wholly-owned subsidiary by
December 31, 2002. TEP, as a utility distribution company UDC, will acquire
energy in the wholesale market for its retail customer energy requirements.
The UDC must acquire at least 50% of its requirements through a competitive
bidding process, while the remainder may be purchased under contracts with
TEP generation subsidiary. The amounts the UDC acquires through competitive
bids may be purchased under bilateral contracts or spot market purchases with
third parties, or potentially with TEP generation subsidiary. Under the
ACC electric competition rules, TEP will be required to provide energy to
any distribution customer who does not choose another energy service provider.
TEP generation subsidiary will sell energy into the wholesale market.
Accounting Implications
In 1997, the Emerging Issues Task Force of the FASB concluded that
application of FAS 71 should be discontinued once sufficiently detailed
deregulation guidance is issued for a separable portion of a business.
However, a company may continue to recognize regulatory assets formerly
associated with the deregulated portion of the business, to the extent the
transition plan provides for their recovery through the regulated transmission
and distribution portion of the business.
Effective November 1, 1999, we stopped applying FAS 71 to our generation
operations because the Settlement Agreement provided sufficient details
regarding the deregulation of TEP generation operations. As a result, we
changed the effects of rate regulation that we had reflected in our financial
statements as a result of applying FAS 71 to our generation operations. This
included - Increasing accumulated capital lease depreciation by $197 million to
reflect the depreciation that would have accumulated had we not applied FAS
71 - Reclassifying $175 million of generation-related regulatory assets to the
Transition Recovery Asset, a distribution-related regulatory asset, because we
believe we will recover these assets through the Fixed CTC component of our
standard rates in our distribution business; and
- Recording $23 million of extraordinary income for balances that needed to
be eliminated to reflect discontinuance of FAS 71 but that could not be
reclassified as part of the Transition Recovery Asset.
The Transition Recovery Asset and Extraordinary Income recorded as a result of
the discontinuation of application of FAS 71 are summarized below.
Transition Recovery Asset
As of November 1, 1999, we recorded a Transition Recovery Asset as
follows  
-Millions of Dollars-
Generation-Related Regulatory Assets
Capital Lease Deprecation Adjustment                $ 197
Deferred Springerville Generation Costs                95
Income Taxes Recoverable Through Future Revenues            65
Other                                 15
Total Reclassified to Transition Recovery Asset on the Balance Sheet  372
Generation-Related Plant Assets                     42
Excess Capacity Deferrals Off Balance Sheet              36
Total Transition Costs Being Recovered Through the Fixed CTC   $ 450
The Generation-Related Plant Assets are included in Plant in Service on
the balance sheet. The Excess Capacity Deferrals are not reflected on our
balance sheet and relate to operating and capital costs associated with
Springerville Unit 2 capacity which were previously expensed when incurred.
Prior to discontinuation of application of FAS 71, these costs were amortized
as an off-balance sheet regulatory asset.
The Total Transition Costs Being Recovered through the Fixed CTC were
amortized as follows                       2 months ended  12 months ended
December 1999   December 2000

balance sheet, at December 31           $370       $353
The remaining Transition Recovery Asset balance will be amortized as
costs are recovered through rates until TEP has recovered $450 million of
transition costs or until December 31, 2008, whichever comes first.
Extraordinary Income
In 1999, as a result of the discontinuance of FAS 71 and the adoption of
FAS 101 for generation operations, we recognized $23 million in extraordinary
income, net of tax, primarily as a result of recognition of deferred
investment tax credits. In accordance with previous actions of the ACC, TEP
had deferred recognition of the benefit of approximately $31 million in
investment tax credits. These benefits were recognized as part of the
discontinuation of FAS 71 as we no longer had a regulatory deferral
requirement. This gain was partially offset by approximately $14 million in
generation-related costs for which TEP did not receive regulatory recovery as
part of its Transition Recovery Asset. These costs included approximately $11
million of generation-related property taxes and approximately $3 million of
net deferred losses related to the sale of emission allowances. We recorded a
net tax benefit of $6 million related to the write-off of these costs.  REGULATORY ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999
These various accounting adjustments leave the balances of regulatory
assets at December 31, 2000 and 1999 as noted in the table below. There are
no remaining regulatory liabilities recorded on the balance sheet at December
31, 2000 and 1999. All of the remaining regulatory assets relate to TEP
distribution and transmission business.                          December 31,
2000    1999
- Millions of Dollars -

Other Regulatory Assets             8      9
Total Regulatory Assets          $434    $ 458
INCOME STATEMENT CHANGES RESULTING FROM THESE RECLASSIFICATIONS
As a result of these reclassifications, many costs in the UniSource
Energy and TEP income statements are reflected in different line items in 2000
than they were in 1998 and 1999. The primary differences are - In 2000, amortization of our capital lease assets and interest related to
Capital Leases are reflected in Depreciation and Amortization and Interest on
Capital Leases, respectively. Through October 1999, these expenses were
included as Capital Lease Expense.
- Amortization of Springerville Unit 1 Allowance and the related Interest
Imputed on Losses Recorded at Present Value are no longer presented in 2000.
In November 1999, the unamortized balance of the Springerville Unit 1
Allowance reduced the Springerville Unit 1 capital lease amount.
- Amortization of Transition Recovery Asset appears as an expense beginning
in November 1999.
- Amortization of Investment Tax Credit no longer contributes to Income Taxes
included in Other Income Deductions in 2000. All ITC was recognized in
November 1999.
INCOME STATEMENT IMPACT OF APPLYING FAS 71
The amortization of the regulatory assets and liabilities discussed in
the previous sections of this note have had the following effect on our income
statements                            Years Ended December 31,
2000  1999  1998
- Millions of Dollars -

Interest Expense
Long-Term Debt                     2    3    2
Interest Imputed on Losses Recorded at Present Value  -   29   34
If TEP had not applied FAS 71 in these years, the above amounts would
have been reflected in the income statements in prior periods. The above
table does not include capital lease expense. Capital lease expense would
have been recognized at different annual amounts if TEP had not applied FAS 71
although the total would be the same over the life of the leases. Lease
expense included on our income statements amounted to $116 million in 1999 and
$114 million in 1998. If we had not applied FAS 71, the Springerville Unit 1
Allowance would have been offset against the Springerville Unit 1 capital
lease asset and the depreciation would have been calculated on a straight-line
method. Our lease expense would have been $124 million in 1999 and $125
million in 1998 if we had not applied FAS 71 in these years. See Deferred
Lease Expense above.
The reclassification of our generation-related regulatory assets to the
Transition Recovery Asset shortened the amortization period for these assets
to nine years.
FUTURE IMPLICATIONS OF CEASING TO APPLY FAS 71 TO OUR REGULATED BUSINESS
We continue to apply FAS 71 for the distribution and transmission
portions of TEP business, our regulated operations. We periodically assess
whether we can continue to apply FAS 71. If we stopped applying FAS 71 to
TEP remaining regulated operations, we would write off the related balances
of TEP regulatory assets as a charge in our income statement. Based on the
balances of TEP regulatory assets at December 31, 2000, if we had stopped
applying FAS 71 to TEP remaining regulated operations, we would have
recorded an extraordinary loss, after-tax of approximately $261 million.
While regulatory orders and market conditions may affect our cash flows, our
cash flows would not be affected if we stopped applying FAS 71. NOTE 3. ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
- 
In 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. A derivative financial instrument or
other contract derives its value from another investment or designated
benchmark. We buy and sell wholesale power using forward contracts which are
considered to be derivatives. Under forward contracts, TEP commits to purchase
or sell a specified amount of capacity or energy at a specified price over a
given period of time, typically for one month, three months or one year.
Forward contracts may consist of sales of TEP excess generating capacity,
purchases to meet our retail and firm energy commitments, or may represent
trading activity, where forward sales and purchases may be made within
established limits to take advantage of favorable market opportunities.
There are two types of gains and losses related to forward contracts:
- An unrealized gain or loss is the difference between the contract price and
the market price at any interim date until the contract is settled.
- A realized gain or loss is the difference between the contract price and
the actual cost of the commodity that was purchased or sold. Realized gains
or losses are recorded in the financial statements at the settlement date. We
base our decision to enter into forward contracts based on an estimated
realized gain.
On January 1, 2001, we adopted FAS 133. For periods prior to 2001, we
recorded realized gains and losses at the contract settlement date. FAS 133
requires us to record unrealized gains and losses throughout the contract
period until settlement. Based on our current interpretation of FAS 133 and
other guidance, we believe our wholesale forward contracts will be classified
as follows - Normal Purchases and Sales: Our off-peak forward purchases and sales
generally qualify as normal purchases and sales and are excluded from the
requirements of FAS 133. The realized gains and losses on these contracts are
reflected in the income statement at the contract settlement date.
- Cash Flow Hedge: On-peak forward purchase contracts to meet our retail and
firm commitments, as well as on-peak forward sales contracts of our excess
system capacity are generally classified as cash flow hedges. Our on-peak
purchases and sales occur daily from 6 a.m. until 10 p.m., Monday through
Saturday. The unrealized gains and losses related to these forward contracts
will be included in Other Comprehensive Income, a component of stockholders'
equity.
- Trading Activity: Our trading activity generally consists of forward on-
peak sales and purchases that do not qualify for cash flow hedge treatment.
The unrealized gains and losses related to these forward contracts will be
reflected in the income statement.
On January 1, 2001, we recorded the cumulative effects of adopting FAS
133 in our financial statements by recording the following after-tax
unrealized gains or losses on our forward contracts as of January 1, 2001 - Income Statement: $4 million of unrealized gain; and
- Other Comprehensive Income, a component of stockholders' equity: $14
million of unrealized loss.
The financial statements for periods prior to 2001 do not reflect the
requirements of FAS 133.
Because of the complexity of derivatives, the FASB established a
Derivatives Implementation Group DIG. To date, the DIG has issued more than
100 interpretations to provide guidance in applying FAS 133. As the DIG
continues to issue interpretations, we may change the conclusions that we have
reached and, as a result, the accounting treatment and financial statement
impact could change in the future. NOTE 4. MILLENNIUM ENERGY BUSINESSES
- 
On January 1, 1998, TEP transferred the stock of its subsidiary,
Millennium Energy Holdings, Inc. to UniSource Energy. See Basis of
Presentation in Note 1. Also see Note 5 for selected financial data for the
Millennium energy businesses.  ENERGY TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS
In 1996, Millennium and ITN Energy Systems, Inc., a privately-held
company ITN formed an entity to develop renewable energy and thin-film
technologies. Millennium and ITN each initially owned 50%. Effective June 1,
2000, the percentages changed to 67% owned by Millennium and 33% owned by ITN.
Additionally, in 2000, Millennium and ITN agreed to form new entities.
At December 31, 2000, Millennium, through its subsidiaries, had an
indirect 67% interest in the following entities and ITN owned the remaining
33 - Global Solar Energy, Inc., is a developer and manufacturer of flexible thin-
film photovoltaic cells. Global Solar began limited production of
photovoltaic cells in 1999. Target markets for its products include military,
space and commercial applications.
In 1999, Millennium agreed to provide $14 million of equity funding. As of
December 31, 2000, Millennium had funded the full $14 million. In 2000,
Millennium agreed to provide an additional $20 million in credit to Global
Solar over a 4-year period to fund its production and expansion. As of
January 31, 2001, Millennium has funded $6 million under this credit
commitment, $4 million of which occurred in 2000.
Because we own 67% of Global Solar as of June 1, 2000, it is consolidated with
UniSource Energy for financial reporting purposes. Previously, Millennium
reported Global Solar earnings losses using the equity method. By the end
of 1999, all of ITN equity contributions had been written down to zero for
financial reporting purposes. As a result, minority interest is not reflected
in the financial statements and Millennium records 100% of Global Solar
losses for accounting purposes. When Global Solar generates net income,
Millennium will recognize 100% of net income to the extent Millennium
recognized losses are greater than Millennium ownership percentage of such
losses.
- Infinite Power Solutions, Inc., is a developer of thin-film batteries and
was established in 2000. In 2000, Millennium committed to provide $6 million
of credit to this entity. As of December 31, 2000 Millennium had not provided
any funding under this agreement. ITN contributed certain assets and
proprietary and intellectual property relating to thin-film battery
technology.
During 2000, Millennium and ITN agreed to form the following entities and
provide funding beginning in 2001 - MicroSat Systems Inc.: is a space systems company formed for the purpose of
developing and commercializing small-scale satellites. Millennium will own
49%, with the remaining 51% owned by ITN. Millennium has agreed to provide
$10 million in equity and $10 million in credit to the venture. ITN will
contribute development contracts and proprietary technologies. As of January
31, 2001, Millennium has provided $2 million in equity under this agreement.
- A product development company that will provide research and development
services to Global Solar affiliates, MicroSat and third parties. Millennium
will own 49%, with the remaining 51% owned by ITN. Millennium committed to
provide $3 million in equity and $1 million in credit. ITN will contribute
certain contracts, technologies and intellectual property, including its
thermal desalinization technology.
Millennium expects to fund a total of $20 million to $35 million to its
various Energy Technology Investments in 2001. A significant portion of the
funding under these agreements will be utilized for research and development
purposes, establishment of the production line, and other administrative
costs. As funds are expended for these purposes, we will recognize expense.
INTERNATIONAL POWER PROJECTS - NATIONS ENERGY CORPORATION
Nations Energy develops independent power projects in foreign energy
markets. Through its subsidiaries, Nations has equity interests in the
following projects - A 40% interest in an independent power producer that owns and operates a 43
MW power plant near Panama City, Panama that sells energy to an unrelated
party. Nations Energy recorded decreases in the market-value of its Panama
investment of $3 million in both 1999 and 2000. Additionally in 2000, Nations
Energy was able to recognize a $3 million deferred tax benefit related to the
decreased value. Nations Energy intends to sell its interest in this project
which has a book value of $1 million at December 31, 2000. We cannot predict
whether future market adjustments will be necessary for this project.
- A 26% interest in a power project located in Curacao, Netherland Antilles.
The 160 MW project is scheduled for completion in 2003. Once completed, the
generating facility will provide all electricity, steam, desalinated water and
compressed air for use in the oil refinery on the island of Curacao and
electricity for distribution to the community of Curacao. As of December 31,
2000, Nations Energy total investment in this project was $3 million,
including the $3 million equity contribution made in December 2000. In
addition, in December 2000, Nations Energy provided a $7 million deposit to
fund scheduled equity contributions through April 2003, a $ 10 million deposit
primarily for possible construction overruns and a guarantee of $6 million of
equity on behalf of another participant in the project.
In January 2000, Nations Energy recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately
$3 million from the sale of its minority interest in a power project located
in the Czech Republic. Nations received $20 million in cash proceeds from the
sale which is reflected in the Cash Flows from Investing Activities in the
UniSource Energy cash flow statement for the year ended December 31, 2000. At
December 31, 1999, this investment totaled $15 million.
In September 1998, Nations Energy sold a 48% interest in Trigen-Nations
Energy, which owns and operates the 40 MW Coors Brewing Company power plant in
Golden, Colorado. The $6 million after-tax gain on the sale is included in
Other Income in the Other Income and Deductions section of the UniSource
Energy income statements. In June 1999, Nations Energy sold its remaining 1%
interest in Trigen-Nations Energy at book value.
ENERGY MARKETING - MEH CORPORATION
On July 23, 1999, MEH sold its 50% ownership interest in NewEnergy to The
AES Corporation AES for approximately $50 million in consideration,
resulting in a pre-tax gain from the sale of approximately $35 million. The
consideration consisted of - Shares of AES common stock valued at $27 million as of July 23, 1999 which
were sold in the third quarter of 1999 at a slight gain; and
- Two $11 million promissory notes, totaling $22 million, issued by
NewEnergy. The notes are collateralized by AES stock and bear interest at
95%. In July 2000, MEH collected $11 million from NewEnergy as scheduled.
The maturity date of the remaining promissory note is July 23, 2001.
As part of the sale agreement, AES repaid a $10 million loan NewEnergy
obtained from an unrelated party that was guaranteed by UniSource Energy.
Previously, UniSource Energy provided guarantees of up to $56 million of
certain performance bonds and contractual obligations relating to NewEnergy
purchases and sales of electricity.  All guarantees of performance bonds and
contractual obligations that UniSource Energy made on behalf of NewEnergy have
been terminated.
MEH originally acquired its 50% ownership in NewEnergy in September 1997
with a $1 million capital contribution. In the first quarter of 1999, MEH
transferred its ownership in New Energy Ventures Southwest NEV SW to
NewEnergy. In 1999 and 1998, MEH recorded pre-tax losses related to
NewEnergy, including NEV SW, of $1 million and $16 million, respectively.
These pre-tax losses were approximately 1% and 42% in 1999 and 1998,
respectively, of UniSource Energy pre-tax income.
Presented below is summarized NewEnergy financial information for the year
ended December 31, 1998, during which we recorded NewEnergy financial
results using the equity method NewEnergy Summarized Financial Information

Because we have no continuing involvement with NewEnergy, other than a
collateralized promissory note from NewEnergy, we do not believe that the
results of NewEnergy operations will affect our continuing operations. At
December 31, 2000, the market value of the collateral supporting the
promissory note exceeded the amount of the promissory note by 369%. The
promissory note represented less than 1% of UniSource Energy total assets at
December 31, 2000 and 1999.
OTHER MILLENNIUM INVESTMENTS AND COMMITMENTS
In July 2000, Millennium made a $15 million capital commitment to a
limited partnership which will fund energy related investments. As of January
31, 2001, Millennium has funded $4 million under this commitment, $1 million
of which was funded in 2000. The remaining $11 million is expected to be
invested within two to three years. A member of the UniSource Energy Board of
Directors has a minor investment in the project. An affiliate of such board
member serves as the general partner.
In November 2000, Millennium made a $5 million capital commitment to a
venture capital fund that will focus on information technology, optics and
biotechnology in Tucson, Arizona. The company that manages the fund is owned
by a member of the UniSource Energy Board of Directors. As of December 31,
2000 Millennium had not funded any amounts under this commitment. Millennium
expects to fund approximately $1 million under this agreement in 2001.
Global Solar has certain government contracts that require Global Solar
to contribute to the research and development effort under a cost share
arrangement. Global Solar share of costs is expensed as incurred or
capitalized in accordance with the terms of the contract. Global Solar
remaining cost share commitment under these contracts at December 31, 2000 and
1999 was $1 million and $3 million, respectively.
RECLASSIFICATION OF MILLENNIUM ENERGY BUSINESSES RESULTS
The operating revenues and expenses from Millennium energy businesses
are currently included as part of UniSource Energy Operating Revenues and
Operating Expenses in the UniSource Energy income statements. Previously,
these revenues and expenses were included in the Millennium Energy Businesses
line item in the Other Income and Deduction sections of the UniSource Energy
income statements. The UniSource Energy income statements for years ended
December 31, 1999 and 1998 have been reclassified to conform to the new
presentation. NOTE 5. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION
- 
Based on the way we organize our operations and evaluate performance, we
have two reportable segments. UniSource Energy principal business segment
is TEP, an electric utility business. The other reportable business segment
is the unregulated energy businesses of Millennium. We describe the
unregulated energy businesses of Millennium in Note 4.
As discussed in Note 1, we record our percentage share of the earnings of
affiliated companies when we hold a 20% to 50% voting interest. Global Solar
is consolidated. See Note 4. Our portion of the net income loss of the
entities in which TEP and Millennium own a 20-50% interest is shown below in
Net Loss from Equity Method Entities.
Intersegment revenues are not material. The only significant reconciling
adjustment is for the elimination of the intercompany note between UniSource
Energy and TEP as well as the related interest income and expense. All other
intercompany activity and balances have been eliminated. The accounting
policies of the segments are described in Note 1. We disclose selected
financial data for our business segments in the following tables                   Segments

- 
TEP LONG-TERM DEBT
LONG-TERM DEBT MATURES MORE THAN ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS. WE SUMMARIZE OUR LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE STATEMENTS OF
CAPITALIZATION.
Bond Issuance and Redemption
During 2000, TEP repaid as scheduled $47 million of its 1222% Series
First Mortgage Bonds which matured on June 1. In addition, TEP redeemed $2
million of its 75% First Collateral Trust Bonds at a discount and made
required sinking fund payments on First Mortgage Bonds of $2 million.
During 1999, TEP did not issue any new bonds or redeem existing bonds,
other than required sinking fund payments of $2 million on First Mortgage
Bonds.
TEP OTHER LONG-TERM DEBT AND AGREEMENTS
FIRST AND SECOND MORTGAGE
TEP first and second mortgage indentures are collateralized by a lien
on TEP utility plant, with the exception of Springerville Unit 2. Utility
Plant under Capital Leases is not subject to such liens or available to other
creditors. San Carlos, a subsidiary of TEP, holds title to Springerville Unit
2.
BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT
TEP has a $441 million Credit Agreement which provides a $100 million
Revolving Credit Facility and a $341 million Letter of Credit Facility. These
credit facilities mature on December 30, 2002 and are collateralized by $441
million of Second Mortgage Bonds. The Credit Agreement contains certain
financial covenants, including cash coverage, leverage and net worth tests.
As of December 31, 2000, TEP was in compliance with these covenants.
The Revolving Credit Facility can be used for general corporate purposes.
At December 31, 2000, TEP had no outstanding borrowings under this facility.
However, in July 2000, TEP borrowed $25 million under the Revolving Credit
Facility and repaid it in August 2000. The proceeds were used to fund on-
going cash expenditures. When we borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility,
the variable interest rate that we pay is dependent, in part, on the credit
rating on TEP senior collateralized debt. We pay an annual commitment fee
on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. This fee is also
dependent on TEP credit ratings. At December 31, 2000, the commitment fee
equaled 025% per year.
The $341 million Letter of Credit Facility secures the payment of
principal and interest on $329 million of tax-exempt variable rate bonds
IDBs. The amount of commitment fee on the Letter of Credit Facility depends
on TEP credit ratings. At December 31, 2000, the commitment fee equaled
125% per year.
CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS
The terms of TEP capital leases are as follows - The Irvington Lease has an initial term to January 2011 and provides for
renewal periods of two or more years through 2020.
- The Springerville Common Facilities Leases have an initial term to 2017 for
one lease and 2021 for the other two leases, subject to optional renewal
periods of two or more years through 2025.
- The Springerville Unit 1 Leases have an initial term to January 2015 and
provide for renewal periods of three or more years through 2030.
- The Springerville Coal Handling Facilities Leases have an initial term to
April 2015 and provide for one renewal period of six years, then additional
renewal periods of five or more years through 2035.

Total         $ 329    $ 805     $ 879   $ 2,013
In addition to the capital lease obligations above, we must ensure $70
million of notes underlying the Springerville Common Facilities leases are
refinanced by June 30, 2003 to avoid a special event of loss under the lease.
This special event of loss would require us to repurchase the Springerville
Common Facilities at the higher of the stipulated loss value of $125 million
or the fair market value of the facilities. Upon such purchase, the lease
would be terminated.
In December 1999, TEP refinanced $70 million of notes underlying the
Springerville Common Facility lease to avoid a special event of loss under the
lease. As a result of refinancing at a higher interest rate, we recorded an
additional $26 million of capital lease obligations and capital lease assets. NOTE 8. FAIR VALUE OF UNISOURCE ENERGY FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In 2000, Millennium purchased $27 million of Springerville Lease Debt
Securities. In November 2000, Millennium sold Springerville Lease Debt
Securities with a carrying value of $25 million to TEP at cost. The remaining
$2 million of Springerville Lease Debt Securities held by Millennium at
December 31, 2000 mature through January 1, 2009. Millennium intends to sell
the remaining Springerville Lease Debt Securities to TEP in the first quarter
of 2001.
TEP intends to hold the investment in Springerville Lease Debt Securities
to maturity $40 million matures through January 1, 2009 and $29 million
matures through January 1, 2013. These Springerville Lease Debt Securities
are stated at amortized cost, which means the purchase cost has been adjusted
for the amortization of the premium and discount to maturity. We base the
fair value of this investment on quoted market prices for the same or similar
debt.
TEP considers the principal amounts of variable rate debt outstanding to
be reasonable estimates of their fair value. We determined the fair value of
TEP fixed rate obligations including the Corporate First Mortgage Bonds, the
First Mortgage Bonds-IDBs, First Collateral Trust Bonds and the Unsecured IDBs
by calculating the present value of the cash flows of each fixed rate
obligation. We used a rate consistent with market yields generally available
as of December 2000 for 2000 amounts and December 1999 for 1999 amounts for
bonds with similar characteristics with respect to: credit rating, time-to-
maturity, and the tax status of the bond coupon for Federal income tax
purposes. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation
methodologies may yield different estimated fair value amounts.
The carrying amounts of our current assets and liabilities approximate
fair value. NOTE 9. DIVIDEND LIMITATIONS
-  UNISOURCE ENERGY
In February 2001, UniSource Energy declared a dividend to the
shareholders of $010 per share of UniSource Common Stock. The dividend,
totaling approximately $3 million, will be paid on March 9, 2001 to common
shareholders of record as of February 15, 2001. During 2000, UniSource Energy
paid quarterly dividends to the shareholders of $008 per share, totaling $10
million.
Our ability to pay cash dividends on common stock outstanding depends, in
part, upon cash flows from our subsidiaries, TEP and Millennium.
TEP
In December 2000 and 1999, TEP paid a dividend of $30 million and $34
million, respectively, to UniSource Energy, the holder of TEP common stock.
TEP met the following requirements before paying these dividends to UniSource
Energy  - Bank Credit Agreement
TEP bank Credit Agreement allows TEP to pay dividends as long as TEP
maintains compliance with the agreement and meets financial covenants.
- ACC Holding Company Order
The ACC Holding Company Order does not allow TEP to pay dividends to
UniSource Energy in excess of 75% of its annual earnings until TEP equity
ratio equals 375% of total capitalization, excluding capital lease
obligations.
- Federal Power Act
This Act states that dividends shall not be paid out of funds properly
included in capital accounts. TEP 2000 and 1999 dividends to UniSource
Energy were paid from current year earnings.
MILLENNIUM
Millennium did not pay any dividends to UniSource Energy in 2000. In
August 1999, Millennium paid a dividend of $10 million to UniSource Energy.
Millennium does not have any dividend restrictions. NOTE 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
- 
TEP COMMITMENTS
Fuel Purchase and Transportation Commitments
TEP has the following commitments to purchase coal and rail  - The Springerville coal contract expires in 2010, but includes an option
to extend the initial term for ten years. See Deferred Springerville
Generation Costs in Note 2. The Springerville rail contract expires in 2009.
- The Irvington coal and rail contracts expire in 2015 or at the end of the
useful life of the coal-fired unit, whichever is earlier.
- The contracts for jointly-owned facilities expire at various dates from
2005 to 2017. See Jointly-Owned Facilities in Note 6.
The Springerville and Irvington coal contracts combined require TEP to
take 21 million tons of coal per year through 2009 at an estimated annual
cost of $48 million for the next 5 years.  The Springerville and Irvington
rail contracts combined require TEP to transport 19 million tons of coal per
year through 2015 at an estimated annual cost of $14 million for the next 5
years. The contracts to purchase coal, including rail transportation, for use
at the jointly-owned facilities require TEP to take 15 million tons of coal
per year through 2005 at an estimated annual cost of $45 million for the next
5 years. All of these contracts include a price adjustment clause that will
affect the future cost of coal. The total amount paid under these contracts
depends on the number of tons of coal purchased and transported. The
aggregate total that TEP incurred under all of these contracts was $157
million in 2000, $152 million in 1999, and $150 million in 1998.
Each of TEP coal purchase contracts requires TEP to pay a take-or-pay
charge if certain minimum quantities of coal are not purchased. Our present
fuel requirements are in excess of the take-or-pay minimums. However,
sometimes TEP purchases coal from other suppliers or switches fuel burn from
one generating station to another to reduce overall fuel costs, resulting in
take-or-pay minimum charges. TEP incurred take-or-pay charges of $4 million
in 2000, 1999 and 1998.
San Juan Coal Contract Amendment
In September 2000, to reduce fuel costs over the next 17 years, TEP
entered into an agreement to amend the San Juan Generating Station coal
supply contract, replacing two surface mining operations with one underground
operation. To amend the contract, TEP is required to make a $15 million
payment in 2003. In September 2000, as a result of this scheduled payment,
TEP recorded a pre-tax $13 million Coal Contract Amendment Fee expense and a
non-current liability which equals the present-value of the $15 million
payment. On an on-going basis, TEP will recognize interest expense, included
in the Interest Imputed on Losses Recorded at Present Value line item on the
income statements, and increase its liability until the payment is made in
January 2003. On a net present value basis, TEP expects the fuel savings to
significantly exceed the $15 million payment that will be made in 2003.
Four Corners Generating Station Commitment
TEP is a 7% owner of Four Corners Generating Station. The station
participation agreement requires that if one of the participants fails to make
its payments for operation of the station when due, the other station
participants must make such payments on behalf of the defaulting party, in
proportion to their ratable ownership interest in the station, for a period of
up to six months. During this time the defaulting participant is entitled to
its share of the power generated by the station. After the grace period, the
defaulting participant must make its payments in arrears before it would be
entitled to its continuing share of power.
Southern California Edison Company SCE is a 48% owner of the station.
In recent public disclosure documents, SCE has indicated that due to the high
cost of wholesale power in California which to date it has not been able to
recover from customers, it may no longer be able to continue to meet its
financial obligations. SCE has made all of its payments for the station for
periods through the end of the year 2000. However, it is uncertain whether
SCE will be able to continue to make its payments during 2001. Based on the
operating budget for the station for the year 2001, in the event that SCE were
to fail to pay, TEP may be required to pay on SCE behalf, for the power SCE
receives, an average amount of $1 million per month for up to six months.
As of the date of this filing, SCE has not defaulted on its payment
obligations with respect to Four Corners. TEP is unable to predict whether
TEP will be required to make any such payments in the future.
Environmental Regulation
The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act Amendments require reductions of sulfur
dioxide SO2 and nitrogen oxide NOx emissions in two phases, more complex
facility permits and other requirements. TEP is subject only to Phase II of
the SO2 and NOx emission reductions which was effective January 1, 2000. All
of TEP generating facilities except existing internal combustion turbines
are affected. TEP spent approximately $1 million in each of 2000, 1999 and
1998 and expects to spend approximately $2 million annually in 2001 and 2002
complying with these requirements.
In 1993, TEP generating units affected by Phase II were allocated SO2
Emission Allowances based on past operational history. Beginning in the year
2000, Phase II generating units were required to hold Emission Allowances
equal to the level of emissions in the compliance year or pay penalties and
offset excess emissions in future years. TEP had sufficient Emission
Allowances to comply with the Phase II SO2 regulations for compliance year
2000. However, due to increased energy output, TEP may have to purchase
additional Emission Allowances for future compliance years. Based on current
estimates of additional required Emission Allowances and market prices, TEP
believes that purchases of Emission Allowances will not have a material effect
on TEP.
TEP may incur additional costs to comply with recent and future changes
in federal and state environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements
at existing electric generating facilities. Compliance with these changes may
result in a reduction in operating efficiency.
The EPA has recently recommended that coal and oil fired electric utility
steam generating units be regulated with respect to hazardous air pollutants
including mercury. Rules relating to this recommendation are to be
promulgated by 2004. We cannot predict the impact of these regulations on
TEP.
MILLENNIUM COMMITMENTS
See Note 4 for a description of Millennium commitments.
TEP CONTINGENCIES
Income Tax Assessments
In 2000 we received an IRS income tax assessment related to tax years
1994, 1995, and 1996. After reviewing the impact of these items on our
accrued tax liabilities and the potential for assessments related to later tax
years, we reversed $1 million of the deferred tax valuation allowance in 2000.
The $1 million reduction in the valuation allowance is presented in Note 12.
Because of the appropriate valuation allowance amounts recorded, we do not
expect the assessment to have a material adverse impact on the financial
statements.
RESOLUTION OF TEP CONTINGENCIES
Income Tax Assessments
In February 1998, the IRS issued an income tax assessment for the 1992
and 1993 tax years. The IRS challenged our treatment of various items
relating to a 1992 financial restructuring, including the amount of NOL and
ITC generated before December 1991 that may be used to reduce taxes in future
periods. In 2000 we settled the 1992 and 1993 audits. After reviewing the
impact of these items on our accrued tax liabilities and the potential for
assessments related to later tax years, we reversed $7 million of the deferred
tax valuation allowance in 2000. The $7 million reduction in the valuation
allowance is presented in Note 12.
ACC Order on the Sierrita Contract
On May 14, 1999, TEP filed a complaint with the ACC against Cyprus
Sierrita Corporation now known as Phelps Dodge Sierrita, Inc. Sierrita
over energy costs that TEP charged to Sierrita under an ACC-approved contract.
Sierrita disputed these charges. The dispute concerned the proper method of
calculating energy charges under the contract. In March 2000, the ACC ruled
in favor of TEP and ordered Sierrita to pay a significant portion of the
disputed charges from May 14, 1999 forward. Sierrita appealed the ACC
order. TEP reversed a $3 million reserve in September 2000 resulting in $3
million of revenue, because TEP believed it was probable that TEP will prevail
in the matters before the Court of Appeals. The $3 million reserve related to
disputed charges for the period of May 17, 1999 through September 30, 2000.
On November 20, 2000, TEP and Sierrita entered into an amendment to their
contract, which was subsequently approved by the ACC on December 12, 2000. As
a result, Sierrita has dismissed its appeals.
Arizona Sales Tax Assessments
From 1990 to 1999 TEP contested certain sales tax assessments received
from the Arizona Department of Revenue ADOR. The sales tax assessments
related to gross income recognized by a former TEP subsidiary from November
1985 through May 1999, as well a component of rents that we paid on our
capital leases from August 1988 to June 1997.
In August 1999, a settlement was reached with the ADOR to settle these
issues for $48 million. The settlement agreement became effective in November
1999 when the lessors and their trustees agreed to the settlement. TEP
previously paid $25 million of the settlement amount in order to file an
appeal in the Arizona courts. Under the terms of the agreement, the remaining
$23 million was deposited into an escrow account and the funds were released
to the ADOR in five equal installments during 1999 and 2000. The settlement
did not result in additional sales tax expense because we had previously
recorded an expense for the settlement amount. NOTE 11. WHOLESALE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCES
- 
Market prices for wholesale power were significantly higher during 2000
than in 1999 and 1998 due to a shortage of generation and the rising price of
natural gas. Due to the escalating prices, two utilities in California have
indicated in public disclosure documents that they may not be able to pay for
all the power they consumed late in 2000. In fact, some amounts due to the
California Power Exchange CPX and the California Independent System Operator
CISO for power consumed in October, November and December 2000 have not yet
been paid to the CPX or CISO. During 2000, TEP did not sell power directly to
either of the utilities publicly indicating that they may not be able to pay
their bills as they come due, but TEP did sell approximately $58 million of
power to the CPX and the CISO.
The CPX has withheld some amounts due to parties that sold power to the
CPX and CISO including TEP. In addition, under default provisions contained
in the CPX tariffs, the CPX has allocated the defaults of CPX participants to
remaining participants based upon the level of trading activity of each
participant during the preceding three-month period. Not only have initial
defaults of a CPX debtor been charged back, but defaults by other participants
on chargebacks have also been charged back. TEP has not collected the full
amount due for sales to the CPX and CISO in the fourth quarter of 2000 and TEP
has been assessed amounts due as charge backs. A number of CPX participants
filed suit against the CPX in February 2001, and a preliminary injunction was
implemented that precludes the CPX from issuing any more invoices for
chargebacks, attempting to collect on chargebacks or exercising against
collateral, until the matter has been resolved by the courts or the FERC. All
parties including the CPX have agreed to refrain from taking any further
actions pending a determination of the issue by the FERC.
Also during 2000, the FERC established certain soft caps on prices for
power sold at the CPX. The caps did not have a significant impact on sales to
the CPX during the first three quarters of 2000. However, during the fourth
quarter of 2000, prices for power in the day-ahead and real-time markets
frequently exceeded the caps established by FERC. To date, no sales have been
rescinded due to a price in excess of the cap, but the FERC and other parties
in California have indicated an intent to seek return of revenues earned by
wholesale power suppliers which they determine to be unlawful profits. The
determination of what would constitute unlawful profits is unclear at the
present time. In January 2001, the cities of San Francisco and San Diego
publicly disclosed that they had filed suit against several large generators
seeking return of what may be determined to be excessive profits.
TEP has not been named in any suits; TEP sales to the CPX were
insignificant as a percent of total sales to the CPX. Substantially all of
the sales TEP made to the CPX in 2000 were at prices at or below the soft caps
imposed by FERC. TEP believes that it has minimal, if any, exposure for any
return of revenues earned in excess of the caps.
We considered the potential non-payment for certain amounts due to TEP
but not yet paid, the chargeback billings to TEP and the potential implication
of the soft caps if they were extended retroactively to the CPX and CISO
markets when we calculated our allowances for doubtful accounts and potential
refunds for wholesale transactions for 2000. We recorded allowances amounting
to approximately $9 million in 2000. We recorded no such allowances during
1999 or 1998. NOTE 12. INCOME TAXES

We record a Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance for the amount of
Deferred Tax Assets that we do not believe we can use to reduce income taxes
on a future tax return. The $8 million decrease in the Deferred Tax Assets
Valuation Allowance in 2000 consists of adjustments to the tax reserve
attributable to the improved likelihood of favorable resolution of tax items.
This tax benefit is included in Income Taxes in Operating Expenses.
In 1999, the Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance decreased $32
million due primarily to recognized ITC Carryforward included in Extraordinary
Income and a reversal of a tax reserve.  In 1998, the Deferred Tax Assets
Valuation Allowance decreased $11 million due primarily to the use of capital
loss and ITC carryforwards.

At December 31, 2000, UniSource Energy and TEP had, for federal income
tax purposes - $302 million of NOL carryforwards expiring in 2006 through 2009;
- $20 million of unused ITC expiring in 2002 through 2005;
- $46 million of AMT credit which will carry forward to future years.
Due to the financial restructuring, a change in TEP ownership occurred
for tax purposes in December 1991. This change limits our use of the NOL and
ITC generated before 1992 under the tax code. At December 31, 2000, we had
approximately $124 million of NOL and $20 million of ITC subject to the pre-
1992 limitation and $178 million of NOL not subject to the limitation.
Because of the appropriate valuation allowance amounts recorded, we do not
expect these annual limitations to have a material adverse impact on the
financial statements. NOTE 13. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PLANS
- 
PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
TEP maintains noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans for all
regular employees. Benefits are based on years of service and the employee
average compensation. TEP makes annual contributions to the plans sufficient
to meet the minimum funding requirements set forth by the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, plus such additional tax deductible amounts as
may be advisable. TEP provides supplemental retirement benefits to employees
whose benefits are limited by IRS benefit or compensation limitations.
TEP also provides health care and life insurance benefits for retirees.
All regular employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach
retirement age while working for TEP. The ACC allows TEP to recover through
rates postretirement costs only as benefit payments are made to or on behalf
of retirees. The postretirement benefits are currently funded entirely on a
pay-as-you-go basis. Under current accounting guidance, TEP cannot record a
regulatory asset for the excess of expense calculated per Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, over actual benefit payments.
The actuarial present values of the benefit obligations are measured at
October 1 for our pension plans and December 31 for our other postretirement
benefit plan. The change in benefit obligation and plan assets and
reconciliation of the funded status are as follows                             Other Postretirement

the accumulated benefit obligation. The transition asset on the pension plans
is being amortized over 15 years. The transition obligation on the
postretirement benefit plan is being amortized over 20 years.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS
All regular employees may contribute up to 15 percent of their pre-tax
compensation, subject to certain limitations, in TEP voluntary, defined
contribution 401k plans. TEP contributes cash to the account of each
participant based on each participant contributions not exceeding 45% of
the participant compensation. Participants direct the investment of
contributions to certain funds in their account. TEP incurred approximately $3
million in expense related to these plans in 2000 and $2 million annually in
1999 and 1998.
STOCK OPTION PLANS
On May 20, 1994, the Shareholders approved two stock option plans, the
1994 Outside Director Stock Option Plan 1994 Directors' Plan and the 1994
Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan 1994 Omnibus Plan.
The 1994 Directors' Plan provided for the annual grant of 1,200 non-
qualified stock options to each eligible director at an exercise price equal
to the market price of the common stock at the grant date, beginning January
3, 1995. These options vest over three years, become exercisable in one-third
increments on each anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth
anniversary. In December 1998, the Board of Directors approved an increase in
the annual grant of non-qualified stock options to 2,000 beginning January
1999.
The 1994 Omnibus Plan allows the Compensation Committee, a committee of
non-employee directors, to grant the following types of awards to each
eligible employee: stock options; stock appreciation rights; restricted stock;
performance units; performance shares; and dividend equivalents. The total
number of shares of UniSource Energy Common Stock that may be awarded under
the Omnibus Plan cannot exceed 41 million.
The Compensation Committee granted stock options to key employees during
2000, 1999, and 1998 and to most employees in 1999. These stock options were
granted at exercise prices equal to the market price of the common stock at
the grant date. These options vest over three years, become exercisable in
one-third increments on each anniversary date of the grant and expire on the
tenth anniversary.
A summary of the activity of the 1994 Directors' Plan and 1994 Omnibus
Plan is as follows              2000       1999       1998

We apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock

we have not recognized any compensation cost for the plans during 1998 through
2000. We have also adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation FAS 123. Had our compensation costs for the stock option plans
been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for awards in 2000,
1999 and 1998 consistent with the provisions of FAS 123, net income and net

- 
Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income before the extraordinary
item by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted EPS assumes that proceeds from the hypothetical exercise of
stock options and other stock-based awards are used to repurchase outstanding
shares of stock at the average fair market price during the reporting period.
The following table shows the amounts used in computing earnings per share and
the effects of potential dilutive common stock on the weighted average number
of shares.                          Years Ended December 31,

Options to purchase 734,000 shares of common stock at $1100 to $1813
per share were outstanding at the end of the year 2000 but were not included
in the computation of diluted EPS because the options' exercise price was
greater than the average market price of the common shares.
At December 31, 2000, UniSource Energy had no outstanding warrants. There
were 46 million warrants outstanding that were exercisable into TEP common
stock. See Note 15. However, the dilutive effect is the same as it would be
if the warrants were exercisable into UniSource Energy Common Stock. NOTE 15. WARRANTS
-  UniSource Energy
In December 2000, 791,966 UniSource Energy Warrants, that were scheduled
to expire on December 15, 2000, were exercised resulting in a $13 million
increase in common stock equity. The remaining 700,445 warrants expired. The
exercised warrants allowed the holder to purchase one share of UniSource
Energy Common Stock for $1600. As a result, 791,966 shares of stock were
issued. At December 31, 2000, UniSource Energy had no outstanding warrants.
TEP
At December 31, 2000, 46 million of TEP Warrants, which expire on
December 15, 2002, were outstanding. The TEP Warrants entitle the holder of
five warrants to purchase one share of TEP common stock for $1600. If all
TEP Warrants were exercised, approximately 900,000 additional shares of TEP
common stock would be issued. The TEP common stock that would be issued upon
the exercise of TEP warrants cannot be converted into UniSource Energy Common
Stock. UniSource Energy holds the common stock of TEP and TEP common stock is
not publicly traded. NOTE 16. UNISOURCE ENERGY SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
- 
In March 1999, UniSource Energy adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan. As of
April 1, 1999, each Common Stock shareholder receives one Right for each share
held. Each Right initially allows shareholders to purchase UniSource Energy
Series X Preferred Stock at a specified purchase price. However, the Rights
are exercisable only if a person or group the acquirer acquires or
commences a tender offer to acquire 15% or more of UniSource Energy Common
Stock. Each Right would entitle the holder except the acquirer to purchase a
number of shares of UniSource Energy Common or Preferred Stock or, in the
case of a merger of UniSource Energy into another person or group, common
stock of the acquiring person having a fair market value equal to twice the
specified purchase price. At any time until any person or group has acquired
15% or more of the Common Stock, UniSource Energy may redeem the Rights at a
redemption price of $0001 per Right. The Rights trade automatically with the
Common Stock when it is bought and sold. The Rights expire on March 31, 2009. NOTE 17. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION

NewEnergy Investment                -   15,351      These items were reflected on TEP financial statements.
The non-cash change in capital lease obligations represents interest
accrued for accounting purposes in excess of interest payments in 2000, 1999,
and 1998 as well as a $26 million increase in the capital lease obligation and
asset resulting from the Springerville Common Facilities Lease refinancing
which occurred in 1999. See Note 7.
When issuing new bonds and redeeming outstanding bonds, a trustee may
hold the proceeds from our issuance of new long-term debt and use the proceeds
to redeem previously outstanding long-term debt. When this occurs, the
Proceeds from the Issuance of Long-Term Debt and the related Payments to
Retire Long-Term Debt are not reported in our cash flow statements because
these transactions did not affect our cash balances.
Non-cash consideration received upon the sale of NewEnergy in 1999
included two NewEnergy promissory notes, as well as AES common stock.
Concurrent with the receipt of these notes and stock, we removed the NewEnergy
investment from our balance sheet and recorded a gain on the sale. See Note
