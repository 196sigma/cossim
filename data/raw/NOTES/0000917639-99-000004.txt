To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of CIDCO Incorporated
In our opinion, the financial statements in the above index present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of CIDCO Incorporated at December
31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance  about whether the financial  statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,  assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTE 1. THE COMPANY
CIDCO Incorporated the Company, a Delaware corporation, designs,
develops and markets subscriber telephone equipment for use with intelligent
Network Services. The Company started its operations in June 1989. The Company
sells its products to individual customers through its Direct Marketing and
Fulfillment  relationships with certain Regional Bell Operating Companies
RBOC, to Telcos directly, and to major national and regional retail chains. NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of
three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
Short-Term Investments
The Company classifies its investment securities as available for sale.
Realized gains or losses are determined on the specific identification method
and are reflected in income. Net unrealized gains or losses are recorded
directly in stockholders' equity except those unrealized losses that are deemed
to be other than temporary which are reflected in the income statement.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being
determined using the standard cost method which approximates first in, first
out. The Company inventories consist of finished goods and raw materials
purchased for the manufacture of finished goods.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets,
ranging from three to five years. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost.
Amortization is computed using the straight-line method and the shorter of the
remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.
Investments in Affiliates
Investments in affiliates, where the Company owns more than 20 percent but
not in excess of 50 percent, are accounted for using the equity method.
New Accounting Standards
In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income FAS 130. FAS 130 establishes standards for reporting comprehensive
income and its components in a financial statement that is displayed with the
same prominence as other financial statements. Comprehensive income as defined
includes all changes in equity net assets during a period from non-owner
sources. Examples of items to be included in comprehensive income, which are
excluded from net income, include foreign currency translation adjustments and
unrealized gain/loss on available-for-sale securities. In accordance with the
provisions of FAS 130, the Company has determined  that the impact of
comprehensive income is not material for disclosure.
In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information FAS 131. This statement
establishes standards for the way companies report information about operating
segments in annual financial statements. It also establishes standards for
related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major
customers. In accordance with the provisions of FAS 131, the Company has
determined that it does not have separately reportable operating segments.
Warranty Costs
Anticipated costs related to product warranties are charged to income as
sales are recognized. The Company has not experienced significant warranty
claims to date.
Revenue Recognition
Direct sales and sales through Fulfillment arrangements are recognized upon
shipment of the product to the customer. Allowances are established to recognize
any risk related to the creditworthiness of customers and for estimated returns.
Sales through certain promotions aimed at Fulfillment customers are dependent on
the customer retention of certain Services provided by the Telco. The Company
reserves for estimated non-retention of such Services by these customers.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred as defined by Statement of
Position 93-7, Reporting on Advertising Costs. Advertising costs for 1998,
1997 and 1996 were $325 million,  $324  million,  and $207 million,
respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Deferred
income taxes are provided for expected tax consequences of temporary differences
between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company assets
and liabilities.
Earnings per Share
Basic Earnings Per Share EPS is computed by dividing net income
available to common stockholders numerator - computed as net income adjusted
for any accretion of dividends paid on preferred stock by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding denominator during the period. Basic EPS
excludes the dilutive effect of stock options. Diluted EPS gives effect to all
dilutive potential common shares outstanding during a period. In computing
diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the
number of shares assumed to be purchased from exercise of stock options.
Following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the
basic and diluted EPS                            Year ended December 31,

1 Potential common stock equivalents issuable upon exercise of options to
purchase 232,256 shares of common stock priced at $100 to $275 per share was
excluded because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive for the year ended
December 31, 1998.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation using the
intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations.
The Company provides additional pro forma disclosures as required under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation. See Note 9.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments and accounts receivable. The Company limits the amount of
credit exposure to any one financial institution and financial instrument. The
Company trade accounts receivable are derived primarily from sales in the
United States and the Far East. The Company maintains reserves for potential
credit losses;  historically,  such losses have been within management
expectations.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in 1997 have been reclassified to conform to the 1998
presentation. NOTE 3. BALANCE SHEET COMPONENTS

NOTE 5. INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATE
During 1996, the Company acquired for $3 million in cash a 33% interest in
the outstanding stock of InfoGear Technology Corporation InfoGear, a company
involved in the development of software for Internet phones. The Company
equity in losses of InfoGear has been included as a component of research and
development expense for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, $06 million
and $24 million, respectively. In 1998, the Company invested and additional
$14 million in Infogear that the Company wrote off as worthless as part of the
restructuring costs. See Note 6 below.
NOTE 6. RESTRUCTURING
The Company incurred a pretax restructuring charge of $27 million in the
first quarter of 1998 as it announced and implemented several streamlining
programs, including combining certain marketing and operations functions,
restructuring research and development activities and discontinuing certain
products, resulting in asset write-downs and the elimination of approximately
100 positions. Approximately $02 million of the restructuring charge requires
cash outlays and should be paid out over the next 6 months. The remaining $21
million represents asset write-downs of inventory of $11 million and leasehold
improvements of $10 million related to discontinued products and relocation of
the Company distribution center from California to Texas. The Company
determined that moving the distribution center has not produced the cost savings
and relocated the distribution center back to California where the distribution
function can be fully integrated with the rest of the Company.
On July 22, 1998, the Company announced a new business strategy focusing on
core telephony products and services, and a restructuring plan implemented in
the second half of 1998, which resulted in one-time charges of $172 million in
the third quarter of 1998. The Company restructuring plan significantly
reduced its personnel and resource costs throughout the core business. As part
of this strategy and restructuring plan, the Company has explored strategic
alternatives with regard to its Internet appliances Division, including the
possible spin-out, sale or wind-down of the division in significant part due to
the high level of marketing, sales and research and development expense that
would be required to develop the market for these products and services. As of
December 31, 1998, the Company sold a relatively minor amount of these assets
and has  discontinued  operation of the Division,  including  laying-off
substantially all of the Division employees. The Company will continue to
attempt to sell certain assets of the Division and will continue to sell its
i-Phone until present finished goods and components are depleted. The Company
employed 250 regular employees and approximately 123 temporary and contract
workers as of December 31, 1998. The restructuring reduced permanent headcount
from the prior year level by approximately 41% as the Company focuses on its
core telephony products and services business. The restructuring is expected to
require cash outlays of approximately $59 million that should be substantially
paid out over the next 3 months. The remaining $112 million represents asset
write-downs of inventory of $59 million and write-offs of investments in
intangible assets including a Sun Microsystems license of $30 million and
equity in InfoGear Technologies Corporation of $14 million.

NOTE 7.  LINE OF CREDIT
The Company has a line of credit for up to $25 million. Borrowings under
the line bear interest at 025% below the bank base rate and the interest is
payable monthly. The bank base rate was 775% per annum at December 31, 1998.
Borrowings under the line are unsecured. As of December 31, 1998, the Company
had not borrowed any funds under the line. The line is primarily used as
security for letters of credit used to purchase inventory from international
suppliers. Letters of credit secured by this line totaled $8,600 as of December
31, 1998. As of the end of 1998, the Company had violated the covenant of
profitability. The bank has waived this violation and the line is currently
being renegotiated to $15 million and secured by substantially all of the
Company assets bearing interest at the banks base rate. NOTE 8. LEASES AND COMMITMENTS
Leases
The Company leases its  headquarters,  call center and distribution
facilities in Morgan Hill, California, under operating leases which expire from
1999 through 2006. The Company also leases office space in Palo Alto, California
under an operating lease that expires in 2002.

Effective in 1993, the Company implemented a Savings and Profit Sharing
Plan the 401k Plan which qualifies as a thrift plan under section 401k
of the Internal Revenue Code. All employees who are 21 years of age or older on
or before the quarterly entry periods are eligible to participate in the 401k
Plan. The 401k Plan allows participants to contribute up to 15% of the total
compensation that would otherwise be paid to the participant, not to exceed the
amount allowed by applicable Internal Revenue Service guidelines. Effective July
1, 1997, the Company contributed for each participant a matching contribution
equal to 50% of the participant before-tax contributions for the year not to
exceed a $2,500 per year maximum per plan participant. Prior to July 1, 1997,
the Company contributed for each participant a matching contribution equal to
25% of the participant before-tax contributions for the year not to exceed 1%

PhoneTel Communications, Inc. filed a complaint in August 1998 in
Federal District Court in Texas, alleging that CIDCO Worldwide, Inc. an
affiliate of the Company and 14 other defendants violated one or more of
PhoneTel telephony patents. The complaint has not been served on the Company
pending the completion of current discussions between PhoneTel and the Company,
and thus litigation has not commenced. Although this matter is at an early
stage, management believes that the Company has not infringed any of PhoneTel
patents, and that it will prevail in any litigation which may proceed from this
complaint. Management of the Company currently believes that the outcome of this
matter and the ultimate effect, if any, on the Company consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows will be immaterial.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company may be involved in
other legal proceedings. As of the date hereof, the Company is not a party to
any other pending legal proceedings that it believes will materially affect its
financial condition or results of operations. NOTE 9. COMMON STOCK AND STOCK PLAN
Common Stock
The Company is authorized to issue up to 35 million shares of Common Stock,
each with a par value of $001 per share. Holders of Common Stock are entitled
to one vote per share on all matters voted on by the Company stockholders. In
March 1994, the Company completed an initial public offering the Offering of
34 million shares of Common Stock and realized net proceeds of $459 million.
In conjunction with the Offering, all outstanding shares of mandatorily
redeemable Preferred Stock were redeemed for $193 million. In August 1994, the
Company completed a second public offering of 35 million shares of Common Stock
at a price of $22 per share. Of such shares, selling stockholders sold 34
million shares and the Company sold 100,000 shares and realized net proceeds of
$17 million. In December 1994, the Company completed an additional public
offering of 19 million shares of Common Stock at a price of $2375 per share.
Of such shares, the Company sold 15 million shares for net proceeds of $335
million and selling stockholders sold 375,650 shares.
Directors' Stock Option Plan
In January 1994, the Company stockholders approved the 1994 Directors'
Stock Option Plan the Directors' Option Plan. Initially, a total of 100,000
shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance under the Directors' Option
Plan, which provides for the granting of stock options to non-employee directors
of the Company. Such options vest immediately with respect to 20% of such
shares, with the remainder vesting in four equal annual installments commencing
one year after the date of grant. In May 1997, the stockholders approved an
amendment to increase the number of shares authorized under the Directors' Stock
Option Plan to 250,000 shares. In January 1994, the Company granted one director
an option under the Directors' Option Plan to purchase 33,350 shares of Common
Stock at an exercise price of $1120 per share. No options were granted under
the Directors' Option Plan during 1995. In November 1996, the Company granted
two directors 66,650 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $1855 per
share. In 1997, the Company granted three directors options under the Directors'
Option Plan to purchase a total of 93,325 shares of Common Stock at an average
exercise price of $1623 per share. In 1998, the Company granted a director
options under the Directors' Option Plan to purchase 30,000 shares at an
exercise price of $475 per share. This option vests in four equal annual
installments commencing one year after the date of grant. An option for 33,325
shares was cancelled in 1998. Stock Grant to Former Executive Officer
In March 1997, the Company then President and Chief Executive Officer,
Daniel L. Eilers, was granted a ten-year stock option to purchase up to 600,000
shares of the Company Common Stock at an exercise price of $1425 per share.
The option was scheduled to vest in equal monthly installments over five years.
This stock option was not issued under either of the Company stock option
plans and the Company filed a Form S-8 Registration Statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission covering the shares issuable upon exercise of
the stock option. In September 1998, a Separation Agreement and Mutual Release,
was executed which enables a total of up to 300,000 of these shares to vest
subject to certain time limits, and reprices 120,000 of the vested shares at
$300 per share.
Stock Option Plans
In May 1993, the Company adopted a stock option plan the Plan under
which the employees and advisors may be granted options to purchase shares of
Common Stock at prices at least equal to the fair market value of the Company
Common Stock on the date of grant. An aggregate of 29 million shares of Common
Stock have been reserved for issuance under the 1993 Stock Option Plan. In April
1998 the Company adopted a second stock option plan the 1998 Plan under
which employees and consultants may be granted options to purchase shares of
Common Stock at an exercise price no less than eighty-five 85% of the fair
market value of the Company Common Stock on the date of grant. A total of
700,000 shares were reserved for issuance under this plan 400,000 at inception
in April and 300,000 shares added in October 1998. Options under both plans
expire ten years from the date of grant. Generally, options granted prior to
August 1, 1997 vested in three equal annual installments commencing one year
from the date of grant. Effective on August 2, 1997, the Board of Directors
changed the standard vesting period for future options to vest 25% after one
year, and an additional 21% each month thereafter until fully vested. The Stock
Option Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors, which determines the vesting provisions, the form of payment for
shares and all other terms of the options. The stock option plans were amended
in October 1998 by the Company Board of Directors to make the Plans
competitive with plans offered by other companies in the Company market.
On January 21, 1997, the Company offered Stock Option Plan participants the
right to replace any remaining unexercised stock options with an equal number of
options at an exercise price of $1243, the closing market price on such date.
Due to the broad decline in market price of the Company stock, a substantial
amount of outstanding stock options had exercise prices considerably above the
current market price. In an effort to provide incentives and retain current
employees, on August 17, 1998 eligible employees participating in the Company
Stock Option Plans were offered the opportunity to elect to exchange outstanding
underwater options for options at an exercise price of $300 per share, the
closing market price on such date. As a provision of the repricing offer,
electing employees are not allowed to exercise their vested options until August
17, 1999.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Stock Purchase Plan
was adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by the Company stockholders
in January 1994. Under the Stock Purchase Plan, an eligible employee may
purchase shares of Common Stock from the Company through payroll deductions of
up to 10% of his or her compensation, at a price per share equal to 85% of the
lesser of the fair market value of the Company Common Stock as of the first or
last trading day of each six month offering period. Offerings will commence on
the first trading day on or after January 1 and July 1 of each year and end on
the last trading day of the period six 6 months later. The Company has
reserved 200,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance under the stock Purchase
Plan.
Stockholder Rights Plan
Effective January 27, 1997, the Company adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan
wherein stock rights will be distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right
for each share of Common Stock held on February 14, 1997, the record date for
such dividend. The key terms of the Stockholder Rights Plan will be activated
if any person acquires 15 percent or more of the Company Common Stock without
the approval of the Company Board of Directors. Once the Plan is activated,
each right will entitle the holder to purchase at a price of $95, a fraction of
a share of Preferred Stock which is equivalent to $190 worth of the Company
Common Stock at the then current market value. Any person holding 15 percent or
more of the stock when the Stockholder  Rights Plan was adopted was
grandfathered for existing holdings. The Company Board of Directors has
retained the right to amend the Stockholder Rights Plan at any time prior to
its activation.
Pro Forma Net Income and Earnings Per Share
Had stock-based compensation cost for the Company stock option and Stock
Purchase Plan been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates using
the Black-Scholes model as prescribed by SFAS 123, the Company results for the
years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 would have been as follows in
thousands                          1998    1997    1996
Net income loss as reported..  $51,439 $ 12,910  $ 18,523

Pro forma basic earnings per share..  $ 404 $  070  $  115
Pro forma diluted earnings per share..  $ 404 $  067  $  108
The pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share is not
representative of the pro forma effect on net income in future years because it
does not take into consideration pro forma compensation expense related to
grants made prior to 1995.   The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes model with the following weighted average assumptions:
1998   1997   1996
Stock option plan:
Expected dividend yield..  00%   00%   00%
Expected stock price volatility.. 118%   65%   65%

The weighted average estimated grant date fair value, as defined by SFAS
123, for options granted under the Stock Option Plan during 1998, 1997 and 1996
was $291, $564 and $1062, respectively. The weighted average estimated grant
date fair value, as defined by SFAS 123, for purchase rights granted under the
Stock Purchase Plan during 1998, 1997 and 1996 was $560, $523 and $1088,
respectively. NOTE 10. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
