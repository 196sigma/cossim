ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Maxis, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Maxis, Inc.
at March 31, 1997 and 1996, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity deficit, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended March 31, 1997. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of Maxis, Inc. at March 31, 1997 and 1996, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
March 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. MAXIS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
COMPANY
Maxis, Inc. Maxis or the Company, a Delaware corporation, develops,
publishes and markets entertainment software for personal computers and 32-bit
game consoles. The Company currently sells its software products, including
affiliate partner products, in North America through software distributors,
major computer and software retailing organizations, consumer electronics
stores, discount warehouse stores and mail order companies. Internationally,
the Company sells its products through a combination of distribution, direct
retail and licensing arrangements.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
The Company translates the accounts of its foreign subsidiaries using the
local foreign currency as the functional currency. The assets and liabilities
of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using current
exchange rates. Gains and losses from this translation have not been material.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses, which have not been material,
are included in the consolidated statements of operations.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Product sales
Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment of product to the
customer, net of appropriate allowances for returns, provided that no
significant vendor obligations remain and collection is deemed probable. Costs
associated with certain post-sales customer obligations are accrued.
Software licenses
Software license revenue and royalty advances are recognized as revenue at
the time the Company has completed all significant performance obligations
under the terms of the license agreement and any amounts paid are
nonrefundable. Amounts received prior to revenue recognition are recorded as
deferred revenue. Continuing royalties received under the terms of licensing
agreements are recognized as revenue when the amount of royalties is
determinable. Revenue from software license agreements totaled $4,569,000 5,479,000 and $2,643,000 for the fiscal years ended March 31, 1997, 1996 and
1995, respectively.
MAJOR CUSTOMERS
Net revenues from sales to one customer accounted for 10% of net revenues
for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1997. Net revenues from sales to three
major customers accounted for 12%, 11%, and 10% of net revenues for the fiscal
year ended March 31, 1996. Net revenues from sales to one customer accounted
for 19% of net revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1995.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid short-term cash
investments with original maturities of three months or less.
24
MAXIS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
Effective April 1, 1994, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115 SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Management determines the
appropriate classification of its debt and equity securities at the time of
purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. Debt
securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has the
positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Debt
securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, which
is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to
maturity. Such amortization is included in interest income. Debt securities,
not classified as held-to-maturity, are classified as available-for-sale and
are carried at amounts which approximate fair value. Realized gains and losses
during fiscal 1997 and 1996 on available-for-sale securities were not
material.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
The Company accounts receivable are principally from distributors and
retailers of the Company products. Accounts receivable are recorded net of
allowances for potential credit losses $1,794,000 and $564,000 at March 31,
1997 and 1996, respectively and sales returns $5,988,000 and $5,043,000 at
March 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The Company performs periodic credit
evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. Actual
credit losses and sales returns may differ from the Company estimates, and
such differences could be material to the financial statements.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of standard cost, which approximates
cost, determined using the first-in, first-out method, or market. The Company
evaluates the quantities on hand relative to current selling prices and
historical and forecasted sales volume. Based on these evaluations, provisions
are made to write inventories down to net realizable value.
FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT
Furniture and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which
range from three to seven years.
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS
Financial accounting standards provide for the capitalization of certain
software development costs after technological feasibility of the software is
established. No such costs have been capitalized because the impact on the
financial statements would be immaterial.
ROYALTIES EXPENSE
Royalties are recognized as cost of revenues based on actual net product
sales or software license revenue. Royalty costs, which are included in cost
of revenues, were $2,058,000, $3,291,000 and $2,304,000 in fiscal 1997, 1996
and 1995, respectively. Royalties paid to a director and stockholder of the
Company, who is the developer of some of Maxis' software products, totaled
$214,000, $243,000 and $323,000 in fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method required by
statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax
25
MAXIS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income
tax purposes.
PER SHARE DATA
Per share data is based on the weighted average number of common shares and
dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. Pursuant to
Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 83,
options to purchase common stock using the treasury stock method granted by
the Company during the 12 months immediately preceding the initial public
offering date have been included in the calculation of weighted average number
of common shares outstanding as if the underlying shares were outstanding for
the year ended March 31, 1995.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for employee stock options in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees and in the year ended March 31, 1997, has adopted the disclosure
only alternative described in Statement of Accounting Standards No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No. 123.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
No. 128, Earnings Per Share SFAS No. 128, which is required to be adopted
for the Company fiscal year ended March 31, 1998. At that time, the Company
will be required to change the method currently used to compute earnings per
share and to restate all prior periods. Under the new requirements for
calculating primary earnings per share, the dilutive effect of common stock
equivalents will be excluded. The impact is expected to result in an increase
in primary earnings per share of $003 for the fiscal year ended March 31,
1996. There is no impact expected for the fiscal years ended March 31, 1997
and 1995. The impact of SFAS No. 128 on the calculation of fully diluted
earnings per share for these years is not expected to be material.

6. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY DEFICIT
COMMON STOCK
In April 1995, the Company was reincorporated in the State of Delaware. As
part of this reincorporation, each outstanding share of the former California
corporation no par common stock was converted to one share of Delaware
corporation $0001 par value common stock and each share of the former
California corporation no par preferred stock was converted to two shares of
the Delaware corporation $0001 par value preferred stock. All preferred
shares and per share information has been restated to reflect the effect of
the conversion.
On June 1, 1995, the Company consummated an initial public offering of
3,450,000 shares of common stock that raised approximately $355 million, net
of expenses. Of the 3,450,000 shares of common stock, 2,450,000 shares were
sold by the Company and 1,000,000 shares were sold by selling stockholders.
1993 STOCK OPTION PLAN
In June 1993, the Company established a stock option plan 1993 Plan
under which incentive and nonqualified stock options may be granted to
employees, directors and consultants of the Company to purchase up to
1,854,000 shares of common stock. The options may be granted at an exercise
price not less than 85% of the fair market value of the common stock at the
date of grant. The fair market value of the common stock was determined by the

If the Company had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair
value of the options granted at grant date as prescribed by SFAS No. 123, net
income loss and earnings loss per share would have been reduced
increased to the pro forma amounts indicated in the table below in
thousands except per share amounts:
YEARS ENDED MARCH 31.
1997     1996
Net income loss--as reported. $  1,675 $  6,188
Net income loss--pro forma. $  2,848 $  5,747
Net income loss per share--as reported. $   015 $   056
Net income loss per share--pro forma. $   025 $   052
Because SFAS 123 is applicable only to options granted subsequent to March
31, 1995, the resulting pro forma compensation cost may not be representative
of that expected in future years.
During fiscal 1995, included in options granted and exercised are options
granted to the Company senior management team to purchase 410,000 shares of
common stock at prices from $073 to $080 per share. These options were
exercised and common stock was issued in exchange for notes receivable. The
notes receivable are for terms from two to nine years, bearing interest at
rates ranging from 624% to 801% with interest payable semiannually and
principal due at maturity.
During fiscal 1995, the Company issued options to purchase 1,072,000 shares
of common stock. The Company recorded deferred compensation of $940,000 for
financial reporting purposes with respect to such option grants to reflect the
difference between the exercise price and deemed fair value, for financial
statement presentation purposes, of the Company common shares. Amortization
of deferred compensation for the fiscal years ended March 31, 1997 and 1996,
totaled $107,000 and $351,000, respectively.
7. 1995 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
In May 1995 the Company established an employee stock purchase plan ESPP
and has reserved an aggregate of 200,000 shares of common stock. The ESPP is
intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Code and permits eligible
employees of the Company to purchase common stock through payroll deductions
of up to 10% of their compensation provided that no employee may purchase more
than $25,000 worth of stock in any calendar year. The ESPP is implemented with
six-month purchase periods as components of 24-month offering periods, the
first such purchase period commenced upon the date of the offering and ended
on the last market trading day on December 29, 1995. The price of common stock
purchased under the ESPP is 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the
common stock on the first day of each offering period or last day of each
purchase period. The ESPP will expire in the year 2005. In fiscal 1997, a
total of 50,000 shares were issued under the plan at prices ranging from
$1041 to $1679 per share. At March 31, 1997, a total of 128,000 shares were
available for issuance under the plan.
8. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT AND BENEFIT PLAN
The Company has a defined contribution retirement plan covering
substantially all employees which operates under Section 401k of the
Internal Revenue Code. Eligible employees may contribute amounts to the plan
subject to certain limitations. The Company matches contributions by plan
participants up to 5% of the participant pretax compensation. Retirement
plan expense for fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995 was $520,000, $321,000 and

10. COMMITMENTS
In June 1995 the Company entered into a seven-year lease for new office
space to house its principal corporate headquarters. The lease agreement and
related amendments provide for monthly payments beginning at $75,000,

for the first five years and six months with the option, at the Company
election, to shorten the term of the lease for a one-time payment equal to
