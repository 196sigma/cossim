Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Business Strategy
Powerwave strategy is to become the leading supplier of advanced RF power
amplifier solutions to the wireless communications industry and includes the
following key elements. provide leading technology to the RF power amplifier industry through
research and development that continues to improve our product technical
performance and establishes new levels of technical performance. utilize our research and development efforts to raise our productivity and to
lower costs. leverage our position as a leading supplier of both single carrier and multi-
carrier RF power amplifiers to increase our market share and expand our
relationships with our existing customers. continue to expand our customer base of wireless network OEMs and leading
wireless network operators; and. maintain our focus on the quality, reliability and manufacturability of our
RF power amplifier products.
Our focus on RF power amplifier technology and the experience we have gained
through the implementation of our products in both analog and digital wireless
networks throughout the world has enabled us to develop substantial expertise in
both multi-carrier and single carrier RF power amplifier technology. We intend
to continue to research and develop new methods to improve RF power amplifier
performance, including efforts to support third generation transmission
standards known as 3G. We believe that both our existing products and new
products in development will enable us to continue to expand our customer base
by offering a broad range of products to meet the diverse requirements of
wireless OEMs and network operators. We also intend to leverage our product
lines in an attempt to expand our relationships with our existing customers and
to add new customers. Powerwave has developed the ability to manufacture both
multi-carrier and single carrier RF power amplifiers in a standard, repeatable
manner, which allows for increased production levels. We believe that we are
able to respond quickly and cost-effectively to new transmission protocols and
design specifications by obtaining components from numerous leading technology
companies. We also believe that our focus on the manufacturability of our RF
power amplifier designs should help us to increase our manufacturing
productivity while reducing our product costs. We believe that this ability to
offer a broad range of products represents a competitive advantage over other
third-party manufacturers of RF power amplifiers.
If we are unsuccessful in designing new products or improving and reducing the
costs of our products, such inability to fulfill these objectives would have a
negative effect on our gross profit margins, business, results of operations and
financial condition. In addition, if our outstanding customer orders were to be
significantly reduced, the resulting loss of volume purchasing could also
adversely effect our cost competitive advantage, which would negatively affect
our gross profit margins, business, results of operations and financial
condition. See Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results--Our Average
Sales Prices are Declining; and --We May Fail to Develop Products that are
Sufficiently Manufacturable or of Adequate Quality and Reliability under Item
7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations. Markets
We sell our RF power amplifier products into various segments of the wireless
communications market. We have defined these segments based upon the RF
frequency in which the product is utilized. The majority of our
3 sales are to the 800-1000 MHz and the 1800-2000 MHz markets. We have also begun
to sell products for use in the 2000+ MHz markets.
Wireless networks typically utilize a number of base stations with high power
antennas to serve a geographical region. Each region is broken down into a
number of smaller geographical areas, or cells. Each cell has its own base
station which uses wireless technology to receive and transmit calls via base
stations BTS and the wireline public switched telephone network PSTN.
Cellular networks typically operate within the 800 and 900 MHz bandwidths of the
radio spectrum and utilize either analog or digital protocols. PCS networks
operate in a substantially similar manner as cellular networks, except that PCS
networks typically operate at 1800 and 1900 MHz bandwidths and utilize only
digital transmission protocols. Third generation 3G networks are expected to
primarily operate in the 2100 MHz range. Transmissions at the higher frequencies
utilized by PCS and 3G networks have shorter transmission waves as compared to
cellular frequency transmissions, which tends to limit the distances
transmissions can travel without significant degradation. Lower frequency
signals penetrate into buildings and other obstacles better than higher
frequency signals. Therefore, wireless networks operating at high frequency
ranges may require smaller operating cells and more base stations than existing
cellular networks to cover the same total geographic area.
In analog cellular networks, each base station is allocated a certain number
of frequency channels, each of which can carry only one call at a time.
Originally, cellular base stations in analog networks used single carrier RF
power amplifiers for each frequency channel allocated to the cell. With the use
of MCPA technology, transmission signals can now be amplified simultaneously
through a single multi-carrier RF power amplifier which allows for the
simultaneous amplification of all channels within a base station. Multi-carrier
RF power amplifiers require significantly higher linearity than do single
carrier designs, but do not require separate, high-maintenance, tunable cavity
filters. By eliminating the need for cavity filters for each channel, multi-
carrier RF power amplifiers reduce overall deployment and maintenance costs
associated with base stations. Many service providers still require additional
capacity to serve the increased flow of transmissions through their networks.
This has led many service providers to move from analog networks to digital
networks.
In digital networks, calls are segmented into time slots or codes and
transmitted across the entire bandwidth of allocated spectrum, rather than in
single channels of that spectrum. The calls are then reassembled when received
at the base station or cellular phone. While using the entire bandwidth of
allocated spectrum results in greater system capacity, there is a greater
likelihood that even minimal background noise will result in interrupted or
dropped calls. Accordingly, ultra-linear amplification is even more critical in
digital networks than in their analog counterparts.
Powerwave provides ultra-linear multi-carrier RF power amplifiers which are
located in base stations and work to increase the signal strength of outgoing
transmissions. Our single carrier and multi-carrier RF power amplifiers work in
base stations with a variety of other sophisticated electronic equipment,
including receivers, radios and oscillators. Products
Powerwave offers both single and multi-carrier RF power amplifiers for use in
cellular networks, including ultra-linear multi-carrier RF power amplifiers for
CDMA, cdma2000, TDMA and GSM digital cellular systems as well as analog systems
utilizing AMPS and TACS protocols. We also offer both single and multi-carrier
RF power amplifiers for use in PCS networks that operate in the international
DCS-1800 frequency 1800 MHz and the United States PCS band at 1900 MHz.
Typical system applications include CDMA, TDMA, and GSM protocols with output
power ranging from 5W to 100W.
Our ultra-linear multi-carrier RF power amplifiers utilize feedforward
technology, and typically pre-distortion. Our multi-carrier designs also
utilize an actively switched output combiner 3 or 4 way, which allows any
number of RF power amplifiers to be hot-swapped, or interchanged, without a
significant loss of power. This design also allows for true cold standby
switching of a standby RF power amplifier, thereby providing network operators
with a backup redundancy solution for even greater reliability. These RF power
amplifiers are designed to be installed in racks of three or four RF power
amplifiers. Smart combiner paralleling units allow for both higher power as
well as
4 system redundancy, which is the ability of the system to remain operational in
the event of the failure of one or more of the paralleled RF power amplifiers.
We offer various versions of our multi-carrier RF power amplifiers providing
from 25 to 140 Watts W or more of average power with maximum distortion of up
to -65dBc or better. Up to 4 units can be combined in parallel utilizing our
fully redundant smart combiner racks for various effective average power
ratings.
We also offer single carrier RF power amplifiers for GSM, CDMA and TDMA
operating systems. Products are available in a wide range of RF output levels.
These products are available in versions ranging from complete stand-alone units
to highly integrated RF power amplifiers for tower-top applications.
3G UMTS networks which will initially operate in the 2100 MHz spectrum will
generally utilize the W-CDMA 3G transmission protocol. The buildout of these
networks is expected to begin in different parts of the world, primarily in Asia
and Europe. OEMs have or are in the process of developing base stations to
support these 3G networks. We have developed and are continuing to develop RF
power amplifiers for use in 3G base stations. We have produced and sold a
limited number of these 3G RF power amplifiers to certain of our OEM customers.
Our multi-carrier RF power amplifiers range in price from $3,500 to over
$15,000 per RF power amplifier, based upon the specification requirements. Our
single carrier RF power amplifiers range in price from $500 to $4,500 per RF
power amplifier depending upon product type and specifications. We also sells
racks, cabinets and combiners for multiple RF power amplifiers, ranging in price
from $1,000 to over $7,500, depending upon specifications. Customers
We sell our products to customers worldwide, including a variety of wireless
OEMs, such as Ericsson, LG Electronics LG formerly LG Information &
Communications, Ltd., Lucent Technologies, Inc. Lucent, Metawave
Communications Corporation Metawave, Nokia Telecommunications Inc.
Nokia, Nortel and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. Samsung. We also sell
our products to operators of wireless networks, such as AT Wireless Services
AT Wireless, Cingular Wireless and Verizon Wireless.
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, our largest customer was Nortel,
which accounted for approximately 47% of our net sales. Also, for fiscal year
2000, our next three largest customers in alphabetical order, Cingular
Wireless, Ericsson and Verizon Wireless each accounted for more than 5% of our
net sales. The loss of any one of these customers, or a significant loss,
reduction or rescheduling of orders from any of our customers, would have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. See Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results--A
Significant Amount of Our Revenues Comes from a Few Customers; --Our Success is
Tied to the Growth of the Wireless Service Market; and --There are Many Risks
Associated With International Operations under Item 7, Management Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Marketing and Distribution, International Sales
We sell our products through a highly technical direct sales force and through
independent sales representatives. Direct sales personnel are assigned to
geographic territories and, in addition to sales responsibilities, manage
networks of independent sales representatives. We also utilize a network of
independent sales representatives selected for their familiarity with our
potential customers and their knowledge of the wireless infrastructure equipment
market. Both the direct sales personnel and independent sales representatives
generate product sales, provide product and customer service, and provide
customer feedback for product development. In addition, the sales personnel and
independent sales representatives receive support from our marketing, product
support and customer service departments.
5  Our marketing efforts are focused on establishing and developing long-term
relationships with potential customers. Sales cycles for certain of our
products, particularly our base station RF power amplifiers, are lengthy,
typically ranging from six to eighteen months. Our customers typically conduct
significant technical evaluations of our products before making purchase
commitments. In addition, as is customary in the industry, sales are made
through standard purchase orders which can be subject to cancellation,
postponement or other types of delays. While certain customers provide us with
forecasted needs, they are typically not bound by such forecasts.
International sales excluding North American sales of our products amounted
to approximately 21%, 33%, and 41% of net sales for the years ended December 31,
2000, January 2, 2000, and January 3, 1999, respectively. Foreign sales of some
of our products may be subject to national security and export regulations and
may require us to obtain a permit or license. In recent years, we have not
experienced any material difficulty in obtaining required permits or licenses.
Foreign sales also subject us to risks related to political upheaval and
economic downturns in foreign nations and regions, such as the economic downturn
in the South Korean and Asian markets in fiscal 1998 and the Brazilian market
during 1999. In addition, historically our foreign customers typically pay for
our products with U.S. Dollars. As such, a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar as
compared to a foreign customer local currency effectively increases the cost
of our products for that customer, thereby making our products less attractive
to such customers. See Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results There are Many Risks Associated With International Operations under Item 7,
Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations. Service and Warranty
Our warranties vary by customer and product type and typically cover defects
in materials and workmanship. We perform warranty obligations and other
maintenance services for our products at our facilities in Southern California
and Seoul, South Korea. We currently have service employees located in South
Korea and utilize our South Korean sales representative location to provide
service and support for the Asian region. Product Development
We invest significant resources in the research and development of new methods
to improve amplifier performance, including reduced noise and increased power in
the RF amplification process. We also invest significant resources in the
development of new amplifier products to support new transmission protocols,
including EDGE and third generation protocols such as W-CDMA and cdma2000. Our
development efforts also seek to reduce the cost and increase the manufacturing
efficiency of both new and existing products. Our research and development
staff consisted of 204 people as of December 31, 2000. Expenditures for
research and development amounted to approximately $411 million in 2000, $263
million in 1999 and $135 million in 1998. See Additional Factors That May
Affect Future Results--We Must Develop and Sell New Products in Order to Keep Up
With Rapid Technological Change under Item 7, Management Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Competition
The wireless communications infrastructure equipment industry is extremely
competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change, new product
development and rapid product obsolescence, evolving industry standards and
significant price erosion over the life of a product. Our products compete on
the basis of the following key characteristics: performance, functionality,
reliability, pricing, quality, designs that can be efficiently manufactured in
large volumes, time-to-market delivery capabilities and compliance with industry
standards. While we believe that we compete favorably with respect to the
foregoing characteristics, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
continue to do so.
Our current domestic competitors include AML Communications, Inc. and
Spectrian Corporation. We also compete with a number of foreign and privately
held companies throughout the world, the subsidiaries of certain
6 multinational corporations and the amplifier manufacturing operations captive
within certain of the leading wireless infrastructure OEMs such as Ericsson,
Lucent, Motorola Corporation Motorola, Nokia and Samsung. Some competitors
have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, sales, marketing
and other resources than Powerwave and have achieved greater name recognition
for their existing products and technologies than we have. We cannot guarantee
that we will be able to successfully increase our market penetration or our
overall share of the RF amplifier marketplace. Our results of operations could
be adversely impacted if we are unable to effectively increase our share of the
RF amplifier marketplace.
Powerwave success depends in large part upon the rate at which wireless
infrastructure OEMs incorporate our products into their systems. We believe
that a substantial portion of the present worldwide production of RF power
amplifiers is captive within the internal manufacturing operations of a small
number of leading wireless infrastructure manufacturers such as Ericsson,
Lucent, Motorola, Nokia and Samsung. Some of these companies regularly evaluate
whether to manufacture their own RF power amplifiers rather than purchase them
from third-party vendors such as Powerwave. Recently, Ericsson purchased
Microwave Power Devices, Inc., one of our competitors. We cannot predict the
ultimate impact this purchase will have on our business with Ericsson. Any
potential reduction in business from Ericsson could have a negative impact on
our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition,
various companies could also directly compete with Powerwave by selling their RF
power amplifiers to other manufacturers and operators, including our customers.
If we are not successful in increasing the use of our products by the leading
wireless infrastructure OEMs, there will be a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. See Additional
Factors That May Affect Future Results--Many Wireless Infrastructure
Manufacturers have Internal RF Power Amplifier Production Capabilities; and
- --The Market in Which We Operate is Highly Competitive under Item 7,
Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.
We have experienced significant price competition and we expect price
competition in the sale of RF power amplifiers to increase. No assurance can be
given that our competitors will not develop new technologies or enhancements to
existing products or introduce new products that will offer superior price or
performance features. We expect our competitors to offer new and existing
products at prices necessary to gain or retain market share. Certain of our
competitors have substantial financial resources, which may enable them to
withstand sustained price competition or a market downturn better than us.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the
pricing of our products, or otherwise, in the future. See Additional Factors
That May Affect Future Results--Our Average Sales Prices are Declining under
Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations. Backlog
Our backlog of orders was approximately $845 million on December 31, 2000,
compared to approximately $982 million on January 2, 2000. We include in our
reported backlog only the accepted product purchase orders with respect to which
a delivery schedule has been specified for product shipment within six months.
Product orders in our backlog are frequently subject to changes in delivery
schedules or to cancellation at the option of the purchaser without significant
penalty. We regularly review our backlog of orders to ensure that it adequately
reflects product orders expected to be shipped within a six-month period. We
make adjustments as customer delivery schedules change and in response to
changes in our production schedule. Accordingly, we stress that although useful
for scheduling production, backlog as of any particular date may not be a
reliable indicator of sales for any future period. Manufacturing and Suppliers
Our headquarters and our manufacturing facility are located in Irvine,
California. We have purchased a facility in Santa Ana, California and expect to
complete the relocation of our operations to this facility during the first
quarter of 2001. Our manufacturing process involves the assembly of numerous
individual components and precise fine-tuning by production technicians. The
parts and materials used by us consist primarily of printed circuit
7 boards, specialized subassemblies, fabricated housings, relays, and small
electric circuit components, such as integrated circuits, semiconductors,
resistors and capacitors.
We currently procure, and expect to continue to procure, certain components
from single source manufacturers due to unique component designs as well as
certain quality and performance requirements. In addition, in order to take
advantage of volume pricing discounts, we purchase certain customized components
from single sources. We have experienced, and may in the future experience,
shortages of single-source components. In such event, we may have to make
adjustments to both product designs and production schedules which could result
in delays in production and delivery of products. Such delays could have an
adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. See
Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results--We Depend on Single Sources
for Key Components under Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
We have been ISO 9001 certified since 1996. Numerous customers and potential
customers throughout the world, particularly in Europe, require that their
suppliers be ISO certified. In addition, many such customers require that their
suppliers purchase components only from subcontractors that are ISO certified. Intellectual Property
We rely upon trade secrets and patents to protect our intellectual property.
We execute confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees and
suppliers and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information.
In 1998, we were granted our first U.S. patent for an aspect of our multi-
carrier technology. We have an on-going program to identify and file
applications for both U.S. and international patents for various aspects of our
technology. We have been granted a total of 10 U.S. patents, and as of December
31, 2000 we have 15 separate U.S. patent applications filed, with multiple
additional international patents filed. All of these efforts along with the
knowledge and experience of our management and technical personnel strengthen
our ability to market our existing products and to develop new products. The
departure of any of our management and technical personnel, the breach of their
confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations to Powerwave or the failure to
achieve our intellectual property objectives may have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We believe that our success depends upon the knowledge and experience of our
management and technical personnel and our ability to market our existing
products and to develop new products.  We do not have non-compete agreements
with our employees who are employed on an at-will basis. Therefore, employees
may leave us and go to work for a competitor. We have had employees leave us
and go to work for competitors. While we believe that we have adequately
protected our proprietary technology, and we will take all legal measures to
protect it, the use of our processes by a competitor could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will
depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and
operate without infringing upon the rights of others. We may not be able to
successfully protect our intellectual property, or our intellectual property or
proprietary technology may otherwise become known or be independently developed
by competitors. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our
products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual
property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
The inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. As the number of patents, copyrights and other
intellectual property rights in our industry increases, and as the coverage of
these rights and the functionality of the products in the market further
overlap, we believe that companies in our industry may face more frequent
infringement claims. We may in the future be notified that we are infringing
upon certain patent or other intellectual property rights of others. Although
we are not aware of any pending or threatened intellectual property lawsuits
against us, we cannot guarantee that such litigation or infringement claims will
not occur in the future. Such litigation or claims could result in substantial
costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. A third party claiming
infringement
8 may also be able to obtain an injunction or other equitable relief, which could
effectively block our ability or our customers' ability to distribute, sell or
import allegedly infringing products. If it appears necessary or desirable, we
may seek licenses from third parties covering intellectual property that we are
allegedly infringing. No assurance can be given, however, that any such licenses
could be obtained on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The failure to obtain
the necessary licenses or other rights could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations. Employees
As of December 31, 2000, Powerwave had 1,295 full and part-time employees,
including 960 in manufacturing, 204 in research and development, 50 in sales and
marketing and 81 in general and administration. None of our employees are
represented by a union. We believe that our relations with our employees are
good. Contract Personnel
Powerwave also utilizes contract personnel hired from third party agencies.
As of December 31, 2000, Powerwave was utilizing approximately 510 contract
personnel, primarily in our manufacturing operations. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Our Irvine, California headquarters and manufacturing facility occupy a
105,000 square foot building under a lease expiring in July 2006. Our sales and
research and development departments occupy a 34,000 square foot building
adjacent to our headquarters and manufacturing facility under a lease also
expiring in July 2006. We have entered into an agreement to terminate the
leases of these two facilities as of June 30, 2001. We lease a 61,300 square
foot warehouse space in Irvine, California under a lease expiring in March 2002.
We plan to vacate this facility during the first quarter of 2001.
In May 2000, we purchased our new Southern California headquarters and
manufacturing facility located in Santa Ana, California. This new facility has
approximately 360,000 square feet, of which 275,000 will be available to us.
The remaining 85,000 square feet is being sublet to an unrelated third party.
We have also entered into an agreement to lease a 115,000 square foot warehouse
facility in Santa Ana, California. The lease on this warehouse facility
commences on April 15, 2001 and has a expiration date of March 31, 2007.
We lease 20,000 square feet in El Dorado Hills, California under a lease
expiring in January 2005 for our Northern California research and development
staff and we have entered into an agreement to lease an additional 11,500 square
feet in another facility, also in El Dorado Hills.
We believe that our new headquarters and manufacturing facility as well as our
remaining leased facilities provide adequate space for our operations. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are subject to various legal proceedings from time to time as part of our
business. In September 1999, a former customer filed a lawsuit against us. The
lawsuit alleged, among other things, that we sold defective LMR products to this
customer from 1994 to 1998. We denied these allegations of wrongdoing. In
December 2000, the parties settled this lawsuit. The settlement did not have a
material adverse effect on the Company.
Powerwave is not currently party to any other legal proceedings, the adverse
outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate, we believe would have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. However, any potential future litigation, regardless of its merits,
could result in substantial costs to us and divert management attention from
our operations.

Years ended December 31, 2000 and January 2, 2000
Net Sales
Our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of RF power amplifiers for
use in wireless communications networks. Sales increased by 53% to $4474
million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $2925 million for the year
ended January 2, 2000. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to
increased demand for our products. For the year ended December 31, 2000, total
sales of products for networks in the 800-1000 MHz range including both single
and multi-carrier RF power amplifiers and associated equipment accounted for
approximately 78% of revenues or $3483 million, compared to approximately 74%
or $2150 million for the year ended January 2, 2000. Sales of RF power
amplifiers and associated products for networks in the 1800-2000 MHz range
consisting mainly of single carrier RF power amplifiers accounted for
approximately 21% of revenues or $961 million for the year ended December 31,
2000, compared to approximately 26% or $768 million for the year ended January
2, 2000. Sales of amplifiers for use in networks over 2100 MHz accounted for
approximately 1% of sales or $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2000
and no revenue for the prior year. We currently expect that sales of amplifiers
for use in networks over 2100 MHz will account for a significantly larger
percentage of sales in the future.
We track the geographic location of our sales based upon the location to which
we ship products. Since many of our customers receive products from us at
central locations and then reship the product with other base station equipment
to locations throughout the world, we are not able to identify the final
installation location of our products. Based upon the location to which we ship
our products, North America has accounted for the majority of
12 our sales. Sales to customers in North America accounted for approximately 79%
of revenue or $3527 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with
approximately 67% of revenue or $1953 million for the year ended January 2,
2000. Our total international sales excluding North American sales accounted
for approximately 21% of revenues or $947 million for the year ended December
31, 2000, compared with approximately 33% or $973 million for the year ended
January 2, 2000. Total Asian sales accounted for approximately 10% of revenues
or $446 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to approximately
21% of revenues or $622 million for the year ended January 2, 2000. See
Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results--A Significant Amount of Our
Revenues Comes from a Few Customers; --Our Success is tied to the Growth of the
Wireless Service Market: and --There are Many Risks Associated With
International Operations.
For fiscal 2000, total sales to Nortel accounted for approximately 47% of
revenues and sales to the following customers in alphabetical order, Cingular
Wireless, Ericsson and Verizon Wireless each accounted for over 5% of revenues
for the year. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to be successful in
attracting new customers or retaining or increasing business with our existing
customers. In addition, we believe that a significant portion of our business
with OEMs, such as Ericsson, Lucent, Nokia and Nortel, is dependent upon the
deployment schedules of wireless network operators who are purchasing
infrastructure equipment from such OEMs and on such OEMs' strategy concerning
the outsourcing of RF power amplifiers. A number of factors may cause delays in
wireless infrastructure deployment schedules for both North American and
international deployments, including deployments in Europe, Brazil, Asia, South
America and other areas. Such factors include economic or political problems in
the wireless operator operating region, delays in government approvals
required for system deployment, delays in the development of new network
architecture, reduced subscriber demand for wireless services and high costs of
wireless spectrum licenses and network infrastructure.  In addition, a number
of factors may cause OEMs to alter their outsourcing strategy concerning RF
power amplifiers, which could cause such OEMs to reduce or eliminate their
demand for external supplies of RF power amplifiers.  Such factors include
lower perceived internal manufacturing costs and competitive reasons to remain
vertically integrated. Some OEMs such as Ericsson, have acquired our
competitors to strengthen their vertical integration. Due to the possible
uncertainties associated with wireless infrastructure deployments and OEM
demand, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant
fluctuations in demand from our OEM customers. Such fluctuations can cause a
significant reduction in revenues or reduction in operating income which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. See Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results --A
Significant Amount of Our Revenues Comes from a Few Customers; --There are Many
Risks Associated With International Operations; and --Our Quarterly Results
Fluctuate Significantly.
Gross Profit
Cost of sales consists primarily of raw materials, assembly and test labor,
overhead and warranty costs. Gross profit margins for fiscal 2000 and 1999 were
318% and 281%, respectively. The increase in gross margins during fiscal
2000 as compared to fiscal 1999 was primarily due to the final closure of the
acquired Folsom manufacturing facility in the fourth quarter of 1999 and the
resulting improvements in manufacturing operating costs in fiscal 2000 as
compared to fiscal 1999. Also during fiscal 2000, sales of multi-carrier RF
power amplifier products accounted for a greater percentage of product sales
when compared to fiscal 1999. Our multi-carrier RF power amplifier products
have traditionally carried higher margins than our single carrier RF power
amplifier products. While we continue to strive for manufacturing and
engineering cost reductions to offset pricing pressures on our products, we
currently expect that our next generation multi-carrier products will not obtain
the level of gross margins that our multi-carrier products have historically
obtained. There can be no assurance that our cost reduction or redesign efforts
will keep pace with price declines and cost increases. If we are unable to
obtain cost reductions through our manufacturing and or engineering efforts, our
gross margins and profitability will continue to be adversely affected. See
Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results--Our Average Sales Prices are
Declining.
As part of our acquisition in October 1998 of Hewlett-Packard Company HP
RF power amplifier business for approximately $659 million the HP
Acquisition we completed an allocation of the purchase price of the
acquisition to both the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired
in the acquisition. The purchase price allocation is included in our financial
statements for the year ended January 3, 1999, and includes an allocation of
$115 million to developed technology acquired and $02 million to workforce.
These amounts were capitalized and are being amortized on a straight-line basis
over five and ten years, respectively, and such amortization is included
13 in cost of sales. For both fiscal 2000 and 1999, approximately $23 million was
amortized and included in cost of sales. See Note 17 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information concerning the purchase
price allocation associated with the HP Acquisition. As an additional part of
the HP Acquisition, we assumed certain specific liabilities from HP related to
the acquired business, including certain warranty obligations. During fiscal
2000 and 1999, we incurred warranty expenses of approximately $04 million and
$07 million respectively, which were offset against specific liabilities
assumed in the acquisition.
The wireless communications infrastructure equipment industry is extremely
competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change, new product
development and product obsolescence, evolving industry standards and
significant price erosion over the life of a product. Due to these competitive
pressures, we expect that average sales prices of our products will continue to
decrease. We have introduced new products at lower sales prices. These lower
sales prices have impacted the average sales prices of our products. Future
pricing actions by us and our competitors may also adversely impact our gross
profit margins and profitability, which could also result in decreased liquidity
and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations. See Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results--We Must
Develop and Sell New Products in Order to Keep Up With Rapid Technological
Change.
Operating Expenses
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales commissions, salaries,
other expenses for sales and marketing personnel, travel expenses, charges for
customer demonstration units, reserves for credit losses and trade show
expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased by 40% to $212 million for
the year ended December 31, 2000 from $152 million for the year ended January
2, 2000. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing expenses were 47% and
52% for the years ended December 31, 2000 and January 2, 2000, respectively.
The increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars was primarily
attributable to increases in sales commission costs and increased staffing
levels associated with our increased revenues. For both fiscal 2000 and fiscal
1999, a total of approximately $08 million related to the customer list and
non-compete agreement acquired in the HP Acquisition has been amortized and
included in sales and marketing expenses.  See Note 17 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information concerning the purchase
price allocation associated with the HP Acquisition.
Research and development expenses include ongoing RF power amplifier design
and development expenses, as well as those design expenses associated with
reducing the cost and improving the manufacturability of existing RF power
amplifiers. Current programs include PCS, cellular and third generation 3G
products. Research and development expenses increased by 56% to $411 million
for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $263 million for the year ended
January 2, 2000. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales for
the years ended December 31, 2000 and January 2, 2000 were 92% and 90 respectively. The increase in actual research and development expenses was
primarily due to increased staffing and associated engineering costs related to
continued new product development and existing product enhancement efforts.
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other
expenses for management, finance, information systems, facilities maintenance
and human resources. General and administrative expenses increased by 27% to
$153 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $121 million for the
year ended January 2, 2000. General and administrative expenses as a percentage
of sales for the years ended December 31, 2000 and January 2, 2000 were 34% and
41%, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses in
absolute dollars is primarily attributable to increased staffing costs
associated with supporting our increased revenues and personnel.
As part of the purchase price allocation of the HP Acquisition, an allocation
of approximately $46 million, reflecting the value of goodwill acquired was
capitalized on our balance sheet. This amount is being amortized over ten years
and is included in general and administrative expenses. For both the year ended
December 31, 2000 and the year ended January 2, 2000, approximately $05 million
was amortized and included in general and administrative expenses. For more
information concerning the purchase price allocation associated with the HP
Acquisition, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
14 Other Income
The Company earned other income, net, of $61 million in fiscal 2000 compared
to $28 million for fiscal 1999. Other income consists primarily of interest
income, net of any interest expense and net tenant rental income from a tenant
in the building we purchased in May 2000.  The increase in other income is
primarily due to increased net interest income as a result of higher average
cash balances during fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999 as well as the
addition of net tenant rental income of approximately $05 million.
Provision Benefit for Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate was 355% and 358% for the years ended December 31,
2000 and January 2, 2000, respectively. The slight decrease in our effective
tax rate was due to tax benefits from international sales and research and
development tax credits. Years ended January 2, 2000 and January 3, 1999
Net Sales
Sales increased by 192% to $2925 million for the year ended January 2, 2000
from $1002 million for the year ended January 3, 1999. The increase in revenue
was primarily attributable to increased demand for our products. Fiscal 1999
includes revenues from the sales of products acquired in the HP Acquisition,
which are only included in the results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998.
For the year ended January 2, 2000, total sales of products for networks on the
800-1000 MHz range including both single and multi-carrier RF power amplifiers
and associated equipment accounted for approximately 74% of revenues or $2150
million, compared to approximately 77% or $773 million for the year ended
January 3, 1999. Sales of RF power amplifiers and associated products for
networks in the 1800-2000 MHz range consisting mainly of single carrier RF
power amplifiers accounted for approximately 26% of revenues or $768 million
for the year ended January 2, 2000, compared to approximately 20% or $196
million for the year ended January 2, 1999. Sales of RF power amplifiers for
use in 400-450 MHz networks accounted for less than 1% of revenues or $07
million for the year ended January 2, 2000, compared to approximately 3% of
revenues or $31 million for the year ended January 3, 1999.  The reduction of
sales of these products is due to both our divestiture of certain of these
products and our strategic decision to no longer focus resources on this area.
Total North American sales accounted for approximately 67% of revenues or
$1953 million for the year ended January 2, 2000 compared with approximately
59% of revenue or $590 million for the year ended January 3, 1999. Total
international sales excluding North American sales, accounted for
approximately 33% of revenues or $973 million for the year ended January 2,
2000, compared with approximately 41% or $412 million for the year ended
January 3, 1999. Total Asian sales accounted for approximately 21% of revenues
or $622 million for the year ended January 2, 2000 compared to approximately
30% of revenues or $302 million for the year ended January 3, 1999. For fiscal
1999, total sales to Nortel accounted for approximately 41% of our revenues. In
addition, sales to the following customers in alphabetical order, Ericsson,
LG, Lucent and Samsung, each accounted for over 5% of revenues for fiscal 1999.
For fiscal 1998 four customers in alphabetical order, Cingular Wireless, LG,
Nortel and Samsung each accounted for more than 10% of our sales.
Gross Profit
Gross profit margins for fiscal 1999 and 1998 were 281% and 341 respectively. The decrease in gross margins compared to the prior year period
was a result of several factors, including increased labor and overhead costs
associated with the significant ramp-up of production personnel and facilities
at our Southern California manufacturing facility due to increased demand for
our products and the transition of the acquired Folsom manufacturing activities
to Southern California during fiscal 1999. The final transition of the Folsom
manufacturing activities was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999. In
addition, our sales during fiscal 1999 as compared to fiscal 1998 also included
a larger percentage of single carrier RF power amplifiers, which traditionally
carry lower gross margins than multi-carrier RF power amplifiers.
15  For fiscal 1999 and 1998, approximately $23 million and $07 million,
respectively, related to developed technology and workforce assets acquired in
the HP Acquisition were amortized and included in cost of sales. During fiscal
1999 and 1998, we incurred warranty expenses of approximately $07 million and
$02 million respectively, which were offset against specific liabilities
assumed in the HP Acquisition. See Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for more information concerning the purchase price
allocation associated with the HP Acquisition.
Operating Expenses
Sales and marketing expenses increased by 59% to $152 million for the year
ended January 2, 2000 from $95 million for the year ended January 3, 1999. As
a percentage of sales, sales and marketing expenses were 52% and 95% for the
years ended January 2, 2000 and January 3, 1999, respectively. The increase in
sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to
increases in sales commission costs and increased staffing levels associated
with our increased revenues. For fiscal 1999 and 1998, approximately $08
million and $02 million, respectively, related to a customer list and a non-
compete agreement acquired in the HP Acquisition were amortized and included in
sales and marketing expenses.  See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for more information concerning the purchase price
allocation associated with the HP Acquisition.
Research and development programs included PCS, cellular and wireless local
loop products and 3G products. Research and development expenses increased by
95% to $263 million for the year ended January 2, 2000 from $135 million for
the year ended January 3, 1999. Research and development expenses as a
percentage of sales for the years ended January 2, 2000 and January 3, 1999 were
90% and 134%, respectively. The increase in actual research and development
expenses was primarily due to increased staffing and associated engineering
costs related to continued new product development and existing product
enhancement efforts.
General and administrative expenses increased by 109% to $121 million for the
year ended January 2, 2000 from $58 million for the year ended January 3, 1999.
General and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for the years ended
January 2, 2000 and January 3, 1999 were 41% and 58%, respectively. The
increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars is primarily
attributable to increased staffing costs associated with supporting our
increased revenues and personnel. In addition, as part of the purchase price
allocation of the HP Acquisition, an allocation of approximately $46 million,
reflecting the value of goodwill acquired, was capitalized on our balance sheet.
This amount is amortized over ten years and included in general and
administrative expenses.
As part of the purchase price allocation of the HP Acquisition, our financial
statements for the year ended January 3, 1999 include the one-time charge of
$124 million for the write-off of acquired in-process research and development
expenses associated with the HP Acquisition. The in-process research and
development expenses arose from new product projects that were under development
at the date of the acquisition and expected to eventually lead to new products
but had not yet established technological feasibility and for which no future
alternative use was identified. The valuation of the in-process research and
development projects was based upon the discounted expected future net cash
flows of the products over the products expected life, reflecting the estimated
stage of completion of the projects and the estimate of the costs to complete
the projects.
Other Income
The Company earned other income, net, of $28 million in fiscal 1999 compared
to $23 million for fiscal 1998. Other income consists primarily of interest
income, net of any interest expense.  To fund a portion of the HP Acquisition,
we borrowed $250 million under a secured bank credit facility in October 1998.
We repaid this facility in full in March 1999. We had total interest expense of
approximately $06 million for fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998.
16 Provision Benefit for Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate was 358% and 365% for the years ended January 2, 2000
and January 3, 1999, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate was
due to tax benefits from international sales and research and development tax
credits. Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have historically financed our operations primarily through a combination
of cash on hand, cash provided from operations, equipment lease financings,
available borrowings under bank lines of credit and both private and public
equity offerings. As of December 31, 2000, we had working capital of $1967
million, including $1287 million in cash and cash equivalents as compared with
working capital of $1186 million at January 2, 2000, which included $767
million in cash and cash equivalents.
Our net accounts receivable increased to $800 million at December 31, 2000
from $475 million at January 2, 2000, consistent with the significant increase
in our revenues during fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999. Net inventory
increased to $513 million at December 31, 2000, from $317 million at January
2, 2000. Cash provided by operations was approximately $576 million in fiscal
2000, compared with cash provided by operations of $396 million in fiscal 1999
and cash used in operations of $87 million in fiscal 1998.  The increase in
cash provided by operations in fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999 is
primarily due to increased net income, as well as increased depreciation and
amortization, offset by cash flow effects due to changes in operating assets and
liabilities.
On May 31, 2000, we paid $353 million for a 360,000 square foot facility
located on approximately 22 acres of land in Santa Ana, California, which we
plan to use as our Southern California headquarters and manufacturing facility.
We have begun the process of consolidating our Southern California manufacturing
operations, engineering, sales and headquarters facility to this facility and we
anticipate completing this process by the end of the first quarter of fiscal
2001. As of December 31, 2000 we had spent approximately $80 million on capital
improvements to this facility. The majority of the remaining amount of capital
spending during fiscal 2000 represents spending on electronic test equipment
utilized in our manufacturing and research and development areas. Total capital
spending for fiscal 2000 was approximately $841 million. The majority of
spending during fiscal 1999 represented spending on electronic test equipment
utilized in our manufacturing and research and development areas.  In addition,
capital spending for fiscal 1999 included a total of $35 million in leasehold
improvement costs. These leasehold improvements related to the expansion of our
manufacturing facility in Irvine, California, the relocation of our engineering
and sales departments to an adjacent leased building in Irvine, California, and
the relocation of our Northern California based engineering staff to a leased
facility in El Dorado Hills, California.
As part of the HP Acquisition, we acquired HP manufacturing and research and
development facility in Folsom, California. We transferred production from the
Folsom manufacturing facility to our Irvine facility. On July 15, 1999, we sold
the Folsom facility for approximately $84 million. We received a consideration
of approximately $0925 million in cash before expenses and an interest-free
note for $7475 million due December 31, 1999. The note was secured by the
land, land improvements and building. In exchange for the interest-free note,
we entered into a rent-free lease with the buyer of the Folsom facility through
December 31, 1999. In December 1999, the note receivable on the Folsom facility
was amended to extend the maturity date to January 27, 2000 and to apply an
annual interest rate of 8% beginning December 31, 1999. The buyer of the Folsom
facility made an additional principal payment of $500,000 on December 30, 1999.
The remaining balance of $6975 million was paid on January 27, 2000 along with
all accrued interest.
On April 28, 1998 we purchased $25 million of 1375% Senior Secured Bridge
Notes due April 28, 2000 the Notes from Metawave Communications Corporation
Metawave, a supplier of smart antennas to the wireless communications
market and a customer, in a private offering. The total amount raised in this
private offering was $290 million. The Notes initially accrued interest at a
rate of 1375% per annum and interest was payable semi-annually. The Notes
contained provisions to increase the rate of interest during the life of the
Notes if the Notes were not repaid prior to maturity. The Notes were secured by
certain assets of Metawave and were redeemed in full on April 28, 1999. Upon the
issuance of the Notes, we received related warrants to purchase
17 53,576 shares of Metawave Series D Preferred Stock at a price of $01 per share.
We exercised these warrants in April 1999. These shares of Series D Preferred
Stock were converted into 51,420 shares of Metawave Common Stock upon Metawave
initial public offering in May 2000. The market value of these securities is
approximately $05 million at December 31, 2000, and is included in prepaid
expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $715 million for fiscal 2000,
compared with $399 million for fiscal 1999. On August 23, 2000 we sold 15
million shares of our Common Stock at a price per share of $411875 to Deutsche
Banc Alex.Brown pursuant to a previously filed shelf registration. Total net
proceeds after expenses were approximately $617 million. During the first
quarter of 1999 we received net proceeds of approximately $578 million from a
public offering of 69 million shares adjusted to reflect a three-for-one stock
split on May 15, 2000 of our Common Stock. In addition, in March 1999 we
utilized approximately $228 million of the 1999 proceeds to retire all
outstanding bank debt associated with the HP Acquisition.
On June 16, 2000 we entered into a revolving credit agreement with Comerica
Bank-California, dated as of May 26, 2000. The credit facility provides for a
revolving line of credit up to a maximum principal amount outstanding at any one
time of $20 million the Revolving Commitment Amount. We are required to pay
a commitment fee of 025% per annum on the unused portion of the Revolving
Commitment Amount. The commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The
revolving credit facility allows for borrowings based either upon the bank
prime rate 95% at December 31, 2000 or the bank LIBOR rate plus an
applicable LIBOR Margin of 125% or 150%, based upon our debt leverage ratio.
There were no amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2000. The revolving credit
facility terminates on May 31, 2001. The revolving credit facility contains
certain standard affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on
future indebtedness, restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, liens,
dividends, mergers, transfers of assets and leverage ratios. We were in
compliance with all covenants contained in the revolving credit facility at
December 31, 2000. The full $20 million of the Revolving Commitment Amount was
available to us at December 31, 2000.
We had cash and cash equivalents of $1287 million at December 31, 2000,
compared with $767 million at January 2, 2000. We regularly review our cash
funding requirements and attempt to meet those requirements through a
combination of cash on hand, cash provided by operations, available borrowings
under any credit facilities, financing through equipment lease transactions, and
possible future public or private debt and/or equity offerings. We invest our
excess cash in short-term, investment-grade money market instruments.
We currently believe that our existing cash balances and funds expected to be
generated from operations will provide us with sufficient funds to finance our
operations for at least the next 12 months.  For fiscal 2001, we currently
anticipate capital spending on equipment to be in the range of $30 million to
$45 million. In addition to property and equipment purchases, during the first
quarter of 2001 we plan to spend approximately $10 million to make capital
improvements to our new Southern California manufacturing and headquarters
facility. Currently, we plan to fund these expenditures from our existing cash
balances. However, in the past, we have utilized both operating and capital
lease financing for certain equipment purchases used in our manufacturing and
research and development operations and expect to continue to selectively do so
in the future. We may in the future require additional funds to support our
working capital requirements or for other purposes, and may seek to raise such
additional funds through the sale of public or private equity and/or debt
financings or from other sources. No assurance can be given that additional
financing will be available in the future or that if available, such financing
will be obtainable on terms favorable to us or our stockholders when we may
require it. Disclosure About Foreign Currency Risk
A significant portion of our revenues have been derived from international
sources, with our international customers accounting for approximately 21% of
fiscal 2000 net sales, 33% of our fiscal 1999 net sales and 41% of our fiscal
1998 net sales. We regularly pursue new customers in various domestic and
international locations where new deployments or upgrades to existing wireless
communication networks are planned. Such international locations include Europe
and South America, where there has been instability in several of the region
currencies, including the Brazilian Real. Although we currently invoice all of
our customers in U.S. Dollars, changes in the
18 value of the U.S. Dollar versus the local currency in which our products are
sold, along with the economic and political conditions of such foreign
countries, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations. In addition, the weakening of an international customer local
currency and banking market may negatively impact such customer ability to
meet their payment obligations to us. Although we currently believe that our
international customers have the ability to meet all of their obligations to us,
there can be no assurance that they will continue to be able meet such
obligations. We regularly monitor the credit worthiness of our international
customers and make credit decisions based on both prior sales experience with
such customers as well as current financial performance and overall economic
conditions. We may decide in the future to offer certain foreign customers
extended payment terms and/or sell certain products or services in the local
currency of such customers. If we sell products or services in a foreign
currency, our results of operations and gross margins may be affected by changes
in currency exchange rates.
Several of the international markets in which we sell our products have
experienced significant weaknesses in their currencies, banking systems and
equity markets in the last few years.  Such weaknesses could negatively impact
demand for wireless services and thereby reduce demand for our products. Such a
reduction in demand for our products could have a negative impact on our future
sales and gross margins. Our foreign customers currently pay for our products
with U.S. Dollars. The past strengthening of the U.S. Dollar as compared to the
Brazilian Real or the South Korean Won, effectively increased the cost of our
products by as much as 100% or more for our Brazilian and South Korean
customers.  Such a significant increase in the local currency based cost of
such products makes them less attractive to such customers.  Accordingly,
changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar,
may negatively impact our future sales and gross margins. For further
discussion of the risks associated with our international sales, see Additional
Factors That May Affect Future Results--There are Many Risks Associated With
International Operations. European Monetary Union
Within Europe, the European Economic and Monetary Union the EMU introduced
a new currency, the euro, on January 1, 1999. The new currency is in response
to the EMU policy of economic convergence to harmonize trade policy, eliminate
business costs associated with currency exchange and to promote the free flow of
capital, goods and services.
On January 1, 1999, the participating countries adopted the euro as their
local currency, initially available for currency trading on currency exchanges
and non-cash transactions such as banking. The existing local currencies, or
legacy currencies, will remain legal tender through January 1, 2002. Beginning
on January 1, 2002, euro-denominated bills and coins will be issued for cash
transactions. For a period of up to six months from this date, both legacy
currencies and the euro will be legal tender. On or before July 1, 2002, the
participating countries will withdraw all legacy currencies and exclusively use
the euro.
Currently all of our transactions are recorded in U.S. Dollars and we do not
currently anticipate future sales transactions being recorded in the euro.
Based on the lack of transactions recorded in the euro, we do not believe that
the euro will have a material effect on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.  In addition, we have not incurred and do not expect
to incur any significant costs from the continued implementation of the
19 euro, including any currency risk, which could materially affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
We have not experienced any significant operational disruptions to date due to
the euro and do not currently expect the continued implementation of the euro to
cause any significant operational disruptions. New Accounting Pronouncements
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities is effective for all fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS No. 133 as amended, establishes accounting
and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. Under SFAS
No. 133, certain contracts that were not previously considered derivatives may
now meet the definition of a derivative. We will adopt SFAS No. 133 effective
January 1, 2001 and we believe that such adoption will not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements, which we adopted in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2000. Adoption of
SAB No. 101 did not have a material impact on the our consolidated financial
statements.
In March 2000, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, an Interpretation of
Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees FIN 44. FIN 44 clarifies the application of APB No. 25 for the
following: the definition of employee for purposes of applying APB No. 25; the
criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non-compensatory plan;
the accounting consequence for various modifications to the terms of a
previously fixed stock option or award; and the accounting for an exchange of
stock compensation awards in a business combination. We adopted FIN 44 effective
July 1, 2000 and such adoption did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements. Additional Factors That May Affect Our Future Results
Our future operating results may be impacted by a number of factors that could
cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated herein, which
reflect our current expectations. These factors include the following. the ability to add new customers to reduce our dependence on any one
customer while maintaining our existing customers;. the ability to increase demand for our products from major wireless
infrastructure OEMs;. the ability to produce both new and existing products which meet the quality
standards of both our existing and potential new customers;. the ability to ramp-up production of new products in both a timely and cost
effective manner;. industry specific factors, including slowdown in demand for wireless
communications and RF power amplifiers;. the impact of any reduction in demand for our products;. the ability to timely develop and produce commercially viable products at
competitive prices;. the ability to maintain a stable and reliable source of electricity to
support our operations at a reasonable cost;. the ability to manage rapid change in demand for our products;. the availability and cost of components;. the ability to finance our activities and maintain our financial liquidity;. the ability of our products to operate and be compatible with various OEMs'
base station equipment;. worldwide and regional economic downturns and unfavorable political
conditions                    20. the ability to manage expense levels;. the ability to manage future product repairs; and. the ability to accurately anticipate customer demand. A Significant Amount of Our Revenues Comes from a Few Customers
We sell most of our products to a small number of customers, and we expect
that this will continue. We believe that our future success depends upon our
ability to broaden our customer base and maintain relationships with major
wireless original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, such as Ericsson, LG,
Lucent, Motorola, Nokia, Nortel and Samsung as well as major operators of
wireless networks, such as AT Wireless, Cingular Wireless and Verizon
Wireless.
Our dependence on a small number of major customers exposes us to numerous
risks, including. slowdowns or delays in deployment of wireless networks that reduce customer
demand for our products;. changes in customer forecasts and demand;. customers leveraging their buying power to change the terms of pricing,
payment and product delivery schedules; and. direct competition should a customer decide to manufacture RF power
amplifiers internally.
For fiscal 2000, our largest customer was Nortel, which accounted for
approximately 47% of our net sales. Also, for fiscal 2000, our next three
largest customers in alphabetical order, Cingular Wireless, Ericsson and
Verizon Wireless, each accounted for more than 5% of our net sales. The loss of
any one of these customers, or a significant loss, reduction or rescheduling of
orders from any of our customers, would have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. In February 2001,
Nortel announced that it was lowering its expectations for wireless
infrastructure demand for the year 2001. Any significant reduction in demand by
Nortel will have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.
The risks related to our customer concentration were magnified in 1998 due
certain of our customer geographic concentration in South Korea which
experienced an economic and financial crisis during 1998. For fiscal 1998, our
South Korean customers accounted for $302 million, or approximately 30% of
total net sales. This was a significant drop from 1997, when our South Korean
customers accounted for $993 million, or approximately 83% of our total net
sales. During fiscal 2000 our South Korean customers accounted for
approximately 8% of total sales or $341 million and in fiscal 1999 they
accounted for approximately 21% of our total net sales or $622 million.
We believe that continued purchases of our products by OEMs is dependent upon
many factors, including the OEMs' view of utilizing third party suppliers of RF
power amplifiers. During fiscal 2000, Ericsson purchased Microwave Power
Devices, one of our competitors. Any shift in demand by an OEM away from
utilizing third party suppliers of RF amplifiers could have a negative impact on
our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, OEM
purchases are impacted by their current view of wireless infrastructure
deployments and could be significantly reduced due to any delays of such
deployments. A number of factors may cause delays in wireless infrastructure
deployments, including the following factors. economic or political problems in the wireless operator operating region;. delays in government approvals required for system deployment;. higher than anticipated network infrastructure costs;. technical delays in the development of new wireless protocols, such as 3G,
and;. reduced subscriber demand for wireless services.
In addition, from time to time OEMs may purchase products from us on a large
quantity basis over a short period of time which may cause demand for our
products to change rapidly. Due to these and other possible
21 uncertainties associated with wireless infrastructure deployments and OEMs'
purchasing strategies, we may experience significant fluctuations in demand from
our OEM customers. Such fluctuations could cause a significant increase in
demand which could exceed our production capacity and could negatively impact
our ability to meet customers' demands as well as could potentially impact
product quality. Alternatively, such fluctuations could cause a significant
reduction in revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot guarantee
that a major customer will not reduce, delay or eliminate purchases from us,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.
Our Quarterly Results Fluctuate Significantly
We have experienced, and will continue to experience, significant fluctuations
in sales and operating results from quarter to quarter. Our quarterly results
fluctuate due to a number of factors, any of which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Factors
that could cause our results of operations to vary include the following. variations in the timing, cancellation, or rescheduling of customer orders
and shipments;. variations in manufacturing costs, capacities and efficiencies;. capacity and production constraints, including constraints associated with
single-source component suppliers;. delays in qualification by customers of new products or redesigns or delays
in qualification of new production facilities;. product failures and associated in-field service support costs;. cancellations or reductions of customer orders and shipments due to economic
slowdowns in the customers' operating regions;. cancellations or rescheduling of customer orders and shipments due to excess
inventory levels caused by changes in demand or deployment schedules at the
customer;. competitive factors, including pricing, availability and demand for
competing amplification products;. warranty expenses;. the availability and cost of components;. the timing, availability and sale of new products by us or our competitors;. changes in the mix of products having differing gross margins;. changes in average sales prices;. long sales cycles associated with our products;. variations in product development and other operating expenses;. discounts given to certain customers for large volume purchases;. interruptions in the supply of electricity and significant increases in the
cost of electricity; and. high fixed expenses that increase operating expenses, especially during a
quarter with a sales shortfall.
In addition, while we periodically receive order forecasts from our major
customers, such customers generally have no binding obligation to purchase the
forecasted amounts. See --A Significant Amount of Our Revenues Comes From a
Few Customers. Order deferrals and cancellations by our customers, declining
average sales prices, changes in the mix of products sold, delays in the
introduction of new products and longer than anticipated sales cycles for our
products have in the past adversely affected our quarterly results of
operations. We cannot guarantee that our quarterly results of operations will
not be similarly adversely affected in the future.
Our sales to customers are usually made under purchase orders with short
delivery requirements. While we receive periodic order forecasts, customers
generally have no obligation to purchase the forecasted amounts and may cancel
orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with
minimal notice. In spite of these limitations, we maintain significant work-in-
progress and raw materials inventory as well as increased levels of technical
production staff to meet estimated order forecasts. If customers purchase less
than the forecasted amounts or cancel or delay existing purchase orders, we will
have higher levels of inventory that face a greater risk
22 of obsolescence and excess production staff. If our customers desire to purchase
products in excess of the forecasted amounts or in a different product mix, we
may lack the inventory or manufacturing capacity to fill their orders. Either
situation could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial
condition and results of operations and future business with such customers.
Due to these factors, our past results are not reliable indicators of our
future performance. Current operating profitability may fall, and future
revenues and operating results may not meet the expectations of public market
analysts and investors. In either case, the price of our Common Stock could be
materially adversely affected. See --Our Stock Price Has Been and May Continue
to Be Volatile.
Our Average Sales Prices are Declining
Our average sales prices have declined, and we anticipate that the average
sales prices for our products will continue to decline and negatively impact our
gross profit margins. Wireless service providers are placing increasing price
pressure on wireless infrastructure manufacturers, which in turn has resulted in
downward pricing pressure on our products. Competition among third-party
suppliers also has increased the downward price pressure on our products. Since
wireless infrastructure manufacturers frequently negotiate supply arrangements
far in advance of delivery dates, we must often commit to price reductions for
our products before we know how, or if, we can obtain such cost reductions. In
addition, average sales prices are affected by price discounts negotiated for
large volume purchases by certain customers. To offset declining average sales
prices, we must reduce manufacturing costs and ultimately develop new products
with lower costs or higher average sales prices. If we cannot achieve such cost
reductions or product improvements, our gross margins will continue to decline.
Sales of single carrier RF power amplifiers have been subject to intense price
competition and historically have carried lower gross profit margins than our
multi-carrier RF power amplifier products. If we cannot reduce manufacturing
costs on our single carrier RF power amplifiers and such RF power amplifiers
continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales, our overall
gross profit margins will fall. In addition, we currently expect that 3G multi-
carrier RF power amplifiers will have lower gross margins than our 2G multi-
carrier products. If we are unable to continue to reduce our manufacturing
costs on all of our products, our gross margins will decline.
Our Failure to Manage Future Growth Could Have Adverse Effects
Our ability to compete effectively and manage future growth depends on our
ability to. effectively expand, train and manage our work force, particularly in
response to fluctuations in demand for various products;. manage production and inventory levels to meet product demand and new
product introductions;. manage and improve production quality;. expand both the range of customers and the geographic scope of our customer
base;. reduce product costs; and. improve financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.
Any failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our Facilities are Located in the State of California Which is Experiencing an
Electricity Shortage
The two largest investor owned electric utility companies in California,
Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, have been experiencing
electricity generation shortages due to the collapse of California
deregulation strategy. The inability of these companies to continue purchasing
electricity has resulted in rolling blackouts in certain parts of the state.
Our Southern California operation is wholly dependent on Southern California
Edison and our Northern California engineering center is wholly dependent upon
Pacific Gas and Electric. As of February 28, 2001 we have not experienced any
interruption in electrical service to our facilities.
23 We currently do not have backup power generators or alternate sources of power
in the extent of a blackout and our current insurance does not provide coverage
for any damages we or our customers may suffer as a result of interruptions of
power supply. We are not able to guarantee that we will not experience any
interruptions in electrical service to our facilities in the future. The loss of
electrical service would cause a temporary shutdown of our operations resulting
in lost production and may cause us to re-calibrate our production equipment,
resulting in potentially significant unanticipated costs. In addition, many of
our suppliers are located in California and could be similarly affected.
Frequent and continuing shutdowns of our operations and those of our suppliers
could cause us to be unable to manufacture the products required by our
customers in a timely manner. Shipments to our customers could be delayed,
resulting in the delay or loss of product revenues. Such delay or loss of
product revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
Furthermore, the deregulation of the energy industry instituted in 1996 by the
California government has caused power prices to increase. Under deregulation,
utilities were encouraged to sell their plants, which traditionally had produced
most of California power, to independent energy companies that were expected
to compete aggressively on price.  Instead, due in part to a shortage of
supply, wholesale prices have skyrocketed over the past year. If wholesale
prices continue to increase and these increases are passed on to end users, the
operating expenses associated with our facilities will likely increase, which
could harm our results of operations.
We Recently Acquired a New Facility and are Currently Consolidating our
Manufacturing Operations, Engineering, Sales and Headquarters Facility to This
New Location
On May 31, 2000 we acquired a 360,000 square foot facility located in Santa
Ana, California. Approximately 85,000 square feet are being sublet to an
unrelated third party, with the remaining 275,000 square feet available for us.
This facility has required substantial re-design and building improvements
before we can relocate our operations to it. We began the capital improvements
to this facility and the initial transition of certain manufacturing operations
to this new facility in fiscal 2000, and we currently expect to have our
operations relocated to this facility by the end of the first quarter of 2001.
Moving our manufacturing operations to a new facility entails numerous risks to
our business operations, including the risk that. we will not complete the moves on schedule;. we will not obtain requalification of our production lines in a timely
manner from our customers who require production line qualifications;. the costs to re-design and improve the facility will escalate and exceed
our current expectations;. the new facility will not function properly and that we will not achieve
the desired benefits from consolidating our operations at one facility; and. the move will result in manufacturing downtime, resulting in the inability
to produce products in the time frame demanded by our customers.
If any of these or other risks occur, they could have a material adverse
affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our Success is Tied to the Growth of the Wireless Services Market
Almost all of our revenues come from the sale of RF power amplifiers for
wireless communications networks. Our future success depends to a considerable
extent upon the continued growth and increased availability of wireless
communications services. Wireless communications services may not continue to
grow and create demand for our products. We believe that continued growth in
the use of wireless communications services depends, in part, on lowering the
cost per subscriber by reducing the costs of the infrastructure capital
equipment and thereby enabling reductions in wireless service pricing.
Although FCC regulations require local phone companies to reduce the rates
charged to wireless carriers for connection to their wireline networks, wireless
service rates will probably remain higher than rates charged by traditional
wireline companies.
24  The expansion of wireless communications services depends on developed
countries, such as the United States, continuing to allow deployment of new
networks and upgrades to existing networks, and on less developed countries
deploying wireless communications networks.
Our performance could be adversely affected by any of the following risks. failure of local governments or foreign countries to allow construction of
new wireless communications systems;. lack of demand for new wireless services;. termination or delays by local governments or foreign countries of existing
construction of wireless communications systems;. imposition of moratoriums by local governments or foreign countries on
building new base stations for existing wireless communications systems; and. foreign authorities may disfavor wireless communications systems because of
environmental concerns, political unrest, economic downturns, favorable
prices for other communications services or delays in implementing wireless
communications systems.
We Depend on Single Sources for Key Components
A number of the parts used in our products are available from only one or a
limited number of outside suppliers due to unique component designs as well as
certain quality and performance requirements. To take advantage of volume
pricing discounts, we also purchase certain customized components from single
sources. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, shortages
of single-sourced components. Shortages have compelled us to adjust our product
designs and production schedules. If single-sourced components become
unavailable in sufficient quantities or available only on unsatisfactory terms,
we would be required to purchase comparable components from other sources and
retune our products to function with the replacement components, or we may be
required to redesign our products to use other components, either of which could
delay production and delivery of our products. In addition, our reliance on
certain single-sourced components exposes us to quality control issues if such
suppliers experience a failure in their production process. A failure in a
single-sourced component could force us to repair or replace a product utilizing
replacement components. Such a requirement could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if
we can not obtain comparable replacements or effectively retune or redesign our
products, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.
Due to our reliance on certain single-sourced customized components, if we
experience an abrupt reduction in customer demand, we may end up with excess
inventories of such components due to the nature of the volume purchasing
agreements that we enter to obtain component cost reductions. If we are unable
to utilize such components in a timely manner and are unable to sell such
components due to their customized nature, the resulting negative impact on our
liquidity and resulting increased inventory levels could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The Market in Which We Operate is Highly Competitive
The wireless communications infrastructure equipment industry is extremely
competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new
product development, rapid product obsolescence, evolving industry standards and
significant price erosion over the life of a product. Our products compete on
the basis of the following key characteristics. performance;. functionality;. reliability;. pricing;. quality;. designs that can be efficiently manufactured in large volumes                    25. time-to-market delivery capabilities; and. compliance with industry standards.
While we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these
characteristics at present, this may change. If we fail to address our
competitive challenges, there could be a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our current competitors include AML Communications, Inc., and Spectrian
Corporation, in addition to a number of privately held companies throughout the
world, subsidiaries of certain multinational corporations and the RF power
amplifier manufacturing operations of the leading wireless infrastructure
manufacturers such as Ericsson, Lucent, Motorola, Nokia and Samsung. Some
competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing,
sales, marketing and other resources than we do and have achieved greater name
recognition for their products and technologies than we have. We may not be
able to successfully increase our market penetration or our overall share of the
RF power amplifier market. Our results of operations could be adversely
impacted if we are unable to effectively increase our share of the RF power
amplifier market.
Our future success depends largely upon the rate at which wireless
infrastructure manufacturers incorporate our products into their systems. A
substantial portion of the present worldwide production of RF power amplifiers
is captive within the internal manufacturing operations of leading wireless
infrastructure manufacturers such as Ericsson, Lucent, Motorola, Nokia and
Samsung. These companies regularly evaluate whether to manufacture their own RF
power amplifiers rather than purchase them from us. During 2000, Ericsson
purchased Microwave Power Devices, one of our competitors. We cannot predict
the ultimate impact this purchase will have on our business with Ericsson. Any
potential reduction in our business with Ericsson could have a negative impact
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition,
various companies could also directly compete with us by selling their RF power
amplifiers to other manufacturers and operators, including our customers. If we
are not successful in increasing the use of our products by the leading wireless
infrastructure manufacturers, there would be a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.
We Must Develop and Sell New Products in Order to Keep Up With Rapid
Technological Change
The markets in which we compete are characterized by. rapidly changing technology;. constant pricing pressure;. evolving industry standards and communications protocols; and. frequent improvements in products and services.
To succeed, we must improve current products and develop and introduce new
products that are competitive in terms of price, performance and quality. These
products must adequately address the requirements of wireless infrastructure
manufacturing customers and end-users.
To develop new products, we invest in the research and development of RF power
amplifiers for wireless communications networks. We target our research and
development efforts on major wireless network deployments worldwide, which cover
a broad range of frequency and transmission protocols. In addition, we are
currently working on products for third generation networks as well as
development projects for products requested by our customers. In spite of our
efforts, the deployment of a wireless network may be delayed which could cause a
particular research or development effort to not generate a revenue producing
product. Additionally, the new products we develop may not achieve market
acceptance or may not be manufacturable at competitive prices in sufficient
volumes. We cannot guarantee the success of our research and development
efforts.
We also continue efforts to improve our existing cellular and PCS lines of RF
power amplifier products. Any delays in the shipment of these products may
cause customer dissatisfaction and delay or loss of product revenues. In
addition, it is possible that a significant number of development projects will
not result in manufacturable new products or product improvements.
26  If we fail to develop new products or improve existing products in a timely
manner, there will be a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
We May Fail to Develop Products that are Sufficiently Manufacturable or of
Adequate Quality and Reliability
Manufacturing our products is a complex process and requires significant time
and expertise to meet customers' specifications. Successful manufacturing is
substantially dependent upon our ability to tune these products to meet
specifications in an efficient manner. In this regard, we depend on our staff
of trained technicians. If we cannot design our products to minimize the manual
tuning process or if we are unable to attract additional trained technicians, or
we lose a number of our trained technicians, it would have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We have had quality problems with our products in the past and may have
similar problems in the future. We have replaced components in some products in
accordance with our product warranties. We believe that our overall
relationship with our customers is good and that they consider our products to
be of good quality. We also believe that our customers will demand increasingly
stringent product performance and reliability. We cannot provide any assurance
that our product designs will remain successful or that they will keep pace with
technological developments, evolving industry standards and new communications
protocols. We may fail to adequately improve product quality and meet the
quality standards of our customers, which could cause us to lose such customers.
Design problems could damage relationships with existing and prospective
customers and could limit our ability to market our products to large wireless
infrastructure manufacturers, many of which build their own, high quality RF
power amplifiers and have stringent quality control standards. See --Many
Wireless Infrastructure Manufacturers have Internal RF Power Amplifier
Production Capabilities.
We Must Retain Key Executives and Personnel
We need to hire and retain highly qualified technical, marketing and
managerial personnel. Competition for personnel, particularly qualified
engineers, is intense, and the loss of a significant number of such persons, as
well as the failure to recruit and train additional technical personnel in a
timely manner, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. The departure of any of our management and
technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality and non-disclosure
obligations to Powerwave or the failure to achieve our intellectual property
objectives may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
We believe that our success depends upon the knowledge and experience of our
management and technical personnel and our ability to market our existing
products and to develop new products. We do not have non-compete agreements
with our employees who are employed on an at-will-basis. Therefore, employees
may leave us and go to work for a competitor. We have had employees leave us
and go to work for competitors. While we believe that we have adequately
protected our proprietary technology, and we will take all legal measures to
protect it, the use of our processes by a competitor could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
There are Many Risks Associated With International Operations
For fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, international revenues excluding North
American sales accounted for approximately 21%, 33% and 41% respectively, of
our net sales. We currently expect that international revenues will continue to
account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future.
Therefore, the following risks associated with international operations could
have a material adverse effect on our performance. compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulations, including
export requirements, tariffs, import duties and other barriers, and health
and safety requirements;. differences in intellectual property protections;. difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations                    27. longer accounts receivable collection cycles;. currency fluctuations;. economic instability, including inflation and interest rate fluctuations,
such as those previously seen in South Korea and Brazil;. competition from foreign based suppliers;. restrictions against the repatriation of earnings from a foreign country;. overlapping or differing tax structures; and. political or civil turmoil.
We have traditionally invoiced all of our foreign sales in U.S. Dollars.
Accordingly, we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging
transactions. However, as we continue to expand our international operations,
we may be paid in foreign currencies and, therefore, would become exposed to
possible losses in foreign currency transactions. Since we sell our products in
many countries, when the U.S. Dollar becomes more expensive relative to the
currency of our foreign customers, the price of our products in those countries
rises and our sales into those countries may fall. This happened to us in South
Korea during 1998. In addition, as we sell our products into foreign countries,
our products can become subject to tariffs and import duties which raise the
overall price of our products to such a level that our products are no longer
competitive in price to locally based suppliers. If any of the above risks
actually occurs, there may be a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
The Sales Cycle for Our Products is Lengthy
The sales cycle associated with our products is typically lengthy, often
lasting from six to eighteen months. Our customers normally conduct significant
technical evaluations of our products and our competitors' products before
making purchase commitments. Our OEM customers typically require extensive
technical qualification of our products before they are integrated into each
OEM products. This qualification process involves a significant investment of
time and resources from us and the OEMs to ensure that our product designs are
fully qualified to perform with each OEM equipment. Also, individual wireless
network operators can subject our products to field and evaluation trials, which
can last anywhere from one to nine months, before making a purchase. The
qualification and evaluation process and the customer field trials may delay the
shipment of sales forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter
and our operating results for that quarter could be materially adversely
affected.
Many Wireless Infrastructure Manufacturers have Internal RF Power Amplifier
Production Capabilities
Many of the leading wireless infrastructure equipment manufacturers internally
manufacture their own RF power amplifiers. We believe that our existing
customers continuously evaluate whether to manufacture their own RF power
amplifiers. Certain of our customers regularly produce RF power amplifiers in
an attempt to replace products manufactured by us. We believe that this
practice will continue. Recently, Ericsson, one of our OEM customers, purchased
Microwave Power Devices, Inc., one of our competitors. In the event that our
customers manufacture their own RF power amplifiers, such customers could reduce
or eliminate their purchases of our products. We cannot guarantee that our
current customers will continue to rely, or expand their reliance, on us as an
external source of supply for their RF power amplifiers.
Wireless infrastructure equipment manufacturers with internal manufacturing
capabilities could also sell RF power amplifiers externally to other
manufacturers, thereby competing directly with us. In addition, even if we are
successful in selling our products to these customers, we believe that such
customers will demand price and other concessions based on their ability to
manufacture RF power amplifiers internally. If, for any reason, our major
customers decide to produce their RF power amplifiers internally or through
joint ventures with other competitors, or require us to participate in joint
venture manufacturing with them, our business, results of operations and
financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
28 Protection of Our Intellectual Property is Limited; Risk of Third-Party Claims
of Infringement
We rely upon trade secrets and patents to protect our intellectual property.
We execute confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees and
suppliers and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information.
We have an on-going program to identify and file applications for both U.S. and
international patents for various aspects of our technology. We have been
granted a total of 10 U.S. patents, and we currently have 15 separate U.S.
patent applications filed. All of these efforts along with the knowledge and
experience of our management and technical personnel strengthen our ability to
market our existing products and to develop new products. The departure of any
of our management and technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality
and non-disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual
property objectives may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
We do not have non-compete agreements with our employees who are employed on
an at-will basis. Therefore, employees may leave us and go to work for a
competitor. We have had employees leave us and go to work for competitors.
While we believe that we have adequately protected our proprietary technology,
and we will take all legal measures to protect it, the use of our processes by a
competitor could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will
depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and
operate without infringing the rights of others. We may fail to do so. In
addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold
may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent
as the laws of the United States.
As the number of patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights in
our industry increases, and as the coverage of these rights and the
functionality of the products in the market further overlap, we believe that
companies in our industry may face more frequent infringement claims. Although
there are no pending or threatened intellectual property lawsuits against us, we
may face litigation or infringement claims in the future. Such claims could
result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources.
A third party claiming infringement may also obtain an injunction or other
equitable relief, which could effectively block the distribution or sale of
allegedly infringing products. Although we may seek licenses from third parties
covering intellectual property that we are allegedly infringing, we cannot
guarantee that any such licenses could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at
all.
Certain of our customers and other wireless communications infrastructure
equipment manufacturers may decide to protect their intellectual property by
deciding not to purchase RF power amplifiers from external sources. The
appearance of a close working relationship with a particular customer may
adversely affect our ability to establish or maintain a relationship with, or
sell products to, competitors of that particular customer. The failure of our
major customers to purchase products from us due to our relationship with other
customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
Actual or Alleged Defects in Our Products May Create Liability to Those
Claiming Injury
Any of the following could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. if systems or devices relying on or incorporating our products are
determined or alleged to create a health risk, causing us to be named as a
defendant, and held liable, in a product liability lawsuit;. delays or prohibitions on the installation of wireless communications
networks due to alleged health or environmental risks; and. our inability to maintain insurance at an acceptable cost or to otherwise
protect against potential product liability lawsuits.
29 Government Regulation of the Communications Industry
The products that we manufacture are regulated. We must obtain regulatory
approvals to manufacture and sell our products and our customers must obtain
approvals to operate our products. The FCC has adopted regulations that impose
stringent RF emissions standards on the communications industry. These
regulations may require that we alter the manner in which radio signals are
transmitted or otherwise alter the equipment transmitting such signals. We are
also subject to regulatory requirements in international markets where prominent
local competitors may have the ability to influence regulations in situations
where we do not.
The enactment by governments of new laws or regulations or a change in the
interpretation of existing regulations could adversely affect the market for our
products. Deregulation of international communications industries along with RF
spectrum allocations made by the FCC have increased the potential demand for our
products. We cannot guarantee that the trend toward deregulation and current
regulatory developments favorable to the promotion of new and expanded wireless
services will continue or that other future regulatory changes will have a
positive impact on us. The increasing demand for wireless communications has
exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards for such
products, generally following extensive investigation and deliberation over
competing technologies. In the past, the delays inherent in this governmental
approval process have caused, and may in the future cause, the cancellation,
postponement or rescheduling of the installation of communications systems by
our customers. These delays could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our Stock Price Has Been and May Continue to Be Volatile
The price of our Common Stock has exhibited high levels of volatility with
significant volume and price fluctuations, which makes our Common Stock not
suitable for all investors. In addition, the stock market has from time to time
experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. The fluctuations in the
stock market are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular
companies, and the market prices for securities of technology companies have
been especially volatile. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect
the market price of our Common Stock. Our stock price may be affected by the
factors discussed above as well as. fluctuations in our results of operations or the operations of our
competitors;. failure of such results of operations to meet the expectations of stock
market analysts and investors;. reductions in demand or expectations of future demand by our customers;. delays or postponement of wireless infrastructure deployments, including new
3G deployments;. changes in the political or economic outlook of the markets into which we
sell our products;. changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us, our
competitors or our customers;. the timing and announcements of technological innovations or new products by
us or our competitors;. changes in the wireless communications industry; and. general market conditions.
Risk of Litigation
We are subject to various legal proceedings from time to time as part of our
business. In September 1999, a former customer filed a lawsuit against us. The
lawsuit alleged, among other things, that we sold defective LMR products to this
customer from 1994 to 1998. We denied these allegations of wrongdoing. In
December 2000, the parties settled this lawsuit. The settlement did not have a
material adverse effect on the Company.
Powerwave is not currently party to any other legal proceedings, the adverse
outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate, we believe would have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. In addition, any potential litigation, regardless of its merits,
could result in substantial costs to us and divert management attention from
our operations. Such diversion could have an adverse impact on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.
30 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and long-term
debt. At December 31, 2000, the carrying values of our financial instruments
approximated their fair values based on current market prices and rates.
It is our current policy to not enter into derivative financial instruments.
We do not currently have any significant direct foreign currency exposure since
aside from operating costs of our South Korean repair operation, we do not
transact business in foreign currencies. Due to this, we do not have any
significant direct foreign currency exposure at December 31, 2000.
We are exposed to a number of market risks in the ordinary course of
business. These risks, which include interest rate risk, foreign currency
exchange risk and commodity price risk, arise in the normal course of business
rather than from trading. We have examined our exposures to these risks and
concluded that none of our exposures in these areas is material to fair values,
cash flows or earnings. We regularly review these risks to determine if we
should enter into active strategies, such as hedging, to help manage the risks.
At the present time, we do not have any hedging programs in place and we are not
trading in any financial or derivative instruments.
We currently do not have any material debt outstanding, so we do not have
interest rate risk from a liability perspective. We do have a significant
amount of cash and short-term investments with maturities less than three
months. This cash portfolio exposes us to interest rate risk as short-term
investment rates can be volatile. Given the short-term maturity structure of
our investment portfolio, and the high-grade investment quality of our
portfolio, we believe that we are not subject to principal fluctuations and the
effective interest rate of our portfolio tracks closely to various short-term
money market interest rate benchmarks.
Our international sales expose us to foreign currency risk in the ordinary
course of our business. Please review our Disclosure About Foreign Currency
Risk in this Form 10-K for a more detailed description of the various risks
involved in our international sales.
We require significant quantities of RF transistors or semiconductors, and
various metals for use in the manufacture of our products. We therefore are
exposed to certain commodity price risk associated with variations in the market
prices for these electronic components. We attempt to manage this risk by
entering into supply agreements with various suppliers of these components.
These supply agreements are not long-term supply agreements so if we become
subject to a significant increase in the price of one of these components, we
would likely be forced to pay such higher prices and we may not be able to pass
such costs onto our customers. In such an event, our business, results of
operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  In addition,
we require specialized electronic test equipment, which is utilized in both the
design and manufacture of our products. Such electronic test equipment is
available from limited sources and may not be available in the time periods
required for us to meet our customers' demand. If required, we may be forced to
pay higher prices for such equipment and or we may not be able to obtain the
equipment in the time periods required, which would then delay our development
or production of new products. Such delays and any potential additional costs
could adversely effect our business, results of operations and financial
condition.
