REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The
Board of Directors and Shareholders of MAXIMUS,Inc. 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MAXIMUS,Inc. as of September30, 2008 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September30, 2009. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of MAXIMUS,Inc. at September30,
2008 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September30, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. 
We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, MAXIMUS,Inc. internal control over financial reporting
as of September30, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report
dated November17, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

MAXIMUS,Inc.      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements      For the years ended September30, 2007, 2008 and 2009     1. Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  a Description of Business  MAXIMUS,Inc. the Company or we provides operations program management and consulting services primarily to government and
government agencies in the United States and to foreign governments. The Company conducts its operations through two business segments: Operations and Consulting. The Operations Segment provides a
variety of program management services, primarily the delivery of administrative services for government health and human service programs. The Consulting Segment provides specialized financial
consulting services such as assisting states, local agencies, and schools in obtaining federal funding reimbursements for their programs, and implementing cost reductions strategies, as well as
providing technical services and software products. 
Other
than disclosed in Note2, the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements reflect operating results from continuing operations. 
The
Company operates predominantly in the United States. Revenue from foreign-based projects and offices was 15%, 17%, and 17% of total revenue for the years ended September30,
2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively.  b Principles of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MAXIMUS,Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. In addition to
the Company wholly owned subsidiaries, the financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended September30, 2007, 2008 and 2009 include a majority 55% owned international subsidiary.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  c Revenue Recognition  In fiscal 2009, approximately 66% of our total revenue was derived from state and local government agencies; 9% from federal government
agencies; 17% from foreign customers; and 8% from other sources, such as commercial customers. Revenue is generated from contracts with various pricing arrangements, including: 1fixed-price;
2performance-based criteria; 3costs incurred plus a negotiated fee cost-plus; and 4time and materials. Also, some contracts contain
not-to-exceed provisions. Of the contracts with not-to-exceed provisions, to the extent we estimate we will exceed the contractual limits, we treat
these contracts as fixed price. For fiscal 2009, revenue from fixed-price contracts was approximately 27% of total revenue; revenue from performance-based contracts was approximately 40% of total
revenue; revenue from cost-plus contracts was approximately 31% of total revenue; and revenue from time and materials contracts was approximately 2% of total revenue. A majority of the
contracts with state and local government agencies have been fixed-price and performance-based, and our contracts with the federal government generally have been cost-plus. Fixed-price and
performance-based contracts generally offer higher margins but typically involve more risk than cost-plus or time and materials reimbursement contracts. 
We
recognize revenue on general service arrangements as work is performed and amounts are earned. We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained,
services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.

For the years ended September30, 2007, 2008 and 2009 
1. Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
We
recognize revenue on fixed-priced contracts when earned, as services are provided. For certain fixed-price contracts, primarily systems design, development and implementation, we
recognize revenue based on costs incurred using estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs to be incurred. The cumulative impact of any revisions in estimated revenue and costs is
recognized in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts are provided for in full in the period in which such
losses become known. 
For
other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis unless evidence suggests that revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different
pattern. With fixed-price contracts, we are subject to the risk of potential cost overruns. Costs related to contracts may be incurred in periods prior to recognizing revenue. These costs are
generally expensed. However, certain direct and incremental set-up costs may be deferred until services are provided and revenue begins to be recognized, when such costs are recoverable
from a contractual arrangement. Set-up costs are costs related to activities that enable us to provide contractual services to a client. The timing of expense recognition may result in
irregular profit margins. 
We
recognize revenue on performance-based contracts as such revenue becomes fixed or determinable, which generally occurs when amounts are billable to customers. For certain contracts,
this may result in revenue being recognized in irregular increments. 
Revenue
on cost-plus contracts is recognized based on costs incurred plus an estimate of the negotiated fee earned. Revenue on time and materials contracts is recognized
based on hours worked and expenses incurred. 
Our
most significant expense is cost of revenue, which consists primarily of project-related costs such as employee salaries and benefits, subcontractors, computer equipment and travel
expenses. Our management uses its judgment and experience to estimate cost of revenue expected on projects. Our management ability to accurately predict personnel requirements, salaries and other
costs as well as to effectively manage a project or achieve certain levels of performance can have a significant impact on the gross margins related to our fixed-price, performance-based and time and
materials contracts. If actual costs are higher than our management estimates, profitability may be adversely affected. Service cost variability has little impact on cost-plus
arrangements because allowable costs are reimbursed by the customer. 
We
also license software under license agreements. Software license revenue is recognized when a customer enters into a non-cancelable license agreement, the software product
has been delivered, there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance, there are no significant future performance obligations, the license fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the
license fee is considered probable. Amounts received in advance of meeting these criteria are deferred and classified as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company
determines the value of the software component of its multiple-element arrangements using the residual method as vendor specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value exists for the undelivered
elements such as the support and maintenance agreements and related implementation and training services, but not for all delivered elements such as the software itself. The residual method requires
revenue to be allocated to the undelivered elements based on the fair value of such elements, as indicated by VSOE. VSOE is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately. Maintenance
and post-contract customer support revenue are recognized ratably over the term of the related agreements, which in most cases is

year. Revenue from software-related consulting services under time and material contracts and for training is recognized as services are performed. Revenue from other software-related contract
services requiring significant modification or customization of software is recognized under the percentage-of-completion method. Where
contracts have multiple deliverables, we evaluate these deliverables at the inception of each contract and as each item is delivered. As part of this evaluation, we consider
whether ia delivered item has value to a customer on a stand-alone basis; iithere is objective and reliable evidence of the fair market value of the undelivered items; and
iiiwhether the delivery of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control, if a general right of return exists. Where deliverables, or groups of
deliverables, have all three of these characteristics, we treat each deliverable item as a separate unit of accounting and apply the relevant revenue recognition guidance to each deliverable.  d Cash Equivalents  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents. Cash equivalents are valued at cost, which approximates market.  e Restricted Cash  Restricted cash represents amounts collected on behalf of certain customers and its use is restricted to the purposes specified under
our contracts with these customers.  f Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  Accounts receivable are recorded at their face amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful
accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk of collecting less than full payment on our receivables. On a regular basis we re-evaluate our client receivables,
especially receivables that are past due, and reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific client collection issues.  g Property and Equipment  Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives not
to exceed 395years for the Company buildings and between three and seven years for office furniture and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over their useful life or the
remaining term of the lease, whichever is shorter.  h Software Development Costs  Software development costs are capitalized and amortized using different methodologies, depending upon the intended use of the asset. All
of the software development costs included within continuing operations relate to software which is intended to be used by the Company. Direct costs of time and material incurred for
the

1. Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued development
of application software for internal use are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, ranging from three to
eight years.  i Deferred Contract Costs  Deferred contract costs consist of contractually recoverable direct set-up costs relating to long-term service
contracts in progress. These costs include direct and incremental costs incurred prior to the commencement of us providing service to enable us to provide the contracted services to our customer. Such
costs are expensed over the period services are provided under the long-term service contract. We review deferred contract costs for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Our review is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the related customer project. To the extent such
projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount, we recognize a non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount to equal
projected future discounted cash flows.  j Goodwill and Intangible Assets  Goodwill is typically obtained by the Company as a result of business combinations. Goodwill represents the difference between the
consideration paid in acquiring the business, including those costs directly incurred as a result of the acquisition, and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. 
Goodwill
is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Impairment testing is performed at the reporting
unit level. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below that operating segment the component level if discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed regularly
by segment management. However, components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics. We recognize an impairment charge for any amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting
unit goodwill exceeds its fair value. We use discounted cash flows to establish fair values. When available and as appropriate, we use comparative market multiples to corroborate the discounted cash
flow results. When a portion
of a reporting unit is disposed of, goodwill is allocated using the relative fair value method for purposes of calculating the gain or loss on disposal. In addition, a goodwill impairment test is
performed for the remaining portion of the reporting unit. 
The
Company performs its annual impairment test as of July1stof each year. Based on the analysis performed as of July1, 2009, the Company determined
that there had been no impairment of goodwill. Following the decision to sell the ERP division, the Company allocated the goodwill held by the Consulting segment between the ERP division and the
remaining Consulting segment, based upon a relative fair value methodology. Fair value was determined using both a discounted cash flow and comparative market multiple approach based upon data
available at September30, 2009. The Company performed goodwill impairment tests over the ERP division and the remaining Consulting segment as of September30, 2009. The Company recorded
a $12million goodwill impairment charge related to the ERP division, which is reflected in the loss on disposal of discontinued operations for the year ended September30, 2009.

For the years ended September30, 2007, 2008 and 2009 
1. Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
Intangible
assets from acquisitions, which consist primarily of customer contracts and relationships, technology-based intangibles and non-competition agreements, are
amortized over one to ten years, based on their estimated useful lives.  k Long-Lived Assets excluding Goodwill  The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the long-term undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the long-lived
assets being evaluated and a determination is made that the fair value of the asset is less than its book value. Any write-downs are treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the
assets. The Company believes that the carrying values of its assets as of September30, 2009 are fully realizable.  l Income Taxes  Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and
liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized
in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A tax benefit or expense is recognized for the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year and the current
tax liability for the year. As of September30, 2009, the Company had $52million of net operating loss carryforwards related to a Canadian subsidiary. A full valuation allowance of
$18million has been established against the related deferred tax asset. Evaluating the net operating loss carryforwards requires us to make certain estimates relating to the future operating
results and cash flows to assess the valuation of the deferred tax assets. 
Since
October1, 2007, the Company has accounted for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon the technical
merits, it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting policy was an increase
in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $04million, which was accounted for as a decrease in the October1, 2007 balance of retained earnings on our consolidated balance
sheet.  m Comprehensive Income Loss  Comprehensive income loss includes changes in the balances of the items that are reported directly as separate components of
shareholder equity. Comprehensive income loss includes net income plus changes in the net unrealized gain loss on investments, net of taxes, and changes in cumulative foreign currency
translation adjustments.  n Foreign Currency  The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates, and revenue and expenses
are translated at average exchange rates for the period. The resulting cumulative translation adjustment is included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheet.
For the years ended September30, 2007, 2008, and 2009, accumulated foreign currency gains losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss were

subsidiaries, are included in other income and were $194,000, $157,000 and $178,000 for the years ended September30, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively.  o Earnings per Share  The Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Basic
earnings per share exclude dilution and are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. 
Diluted
earnings per share reflect potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Diluted
earnings per share include the incremental effect of stock options and restricted stock units calculated using the treasury stock method.  p Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The Company considers the recorded value of its financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable and accounts payable, to approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities at September30, 2008 and 2009.  q Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates used by the Company include estimates of profits or loss on contracts in process,
estimates of collectability of receivables, evaluation of asset impairment and accrual of estimated liabilities.  r Legal and Settlement Expense Recovery, Net  Legal and settlement expense consists of costs, net of reimbursed insurance claims, related to significant legal settlements and
non-routine legal matters, including future probable legal costs estimated to be incurred in connection with those matters. Legal expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business are
included in selling, general and administrative expense.  s Reclassifications  Certain financial results have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications include the
qualification of our Enterprise Resource Performance ERP division as discontinued operations. We reclassified our consolidated balance sheet as of September30, 2008 to show the assets and
liabilities of the ERP division as discontinued operations. We also reclassified our

consolidated
statements of operations and statements of cash flows for the years ended September30, 2007 and 2008 to show the results of this division as discontinued operations.  t Contingencies  From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, including contract and employment claims, in the ordinary course of business.
We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these contingencies as well as potential ranges of probable losses and establish reserves accordingly. The amount of reserves required
may change in future periods due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach to a matter such as a change in settlement strategy. 
2. Discontinued Operations  The Company has classified the results of the following divisions within discontinued operations: Enterprise Resource Planning ERP, Security Solutions, Justice Solutions, Education
Systems and Asset Solutions. The results of these divisions were previously reported within the Company Systems segment. Following the sale of the other divisions in 2008, the results of the ERP
division was reported within the Company Consulting segment. 
The
Company has classified the results of its Unison MAXIMUS,Inc. subsidiary Unison within discontinued operations. Unison results were previously reported within the
Company Operating Segment. 
The
associated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of these businesses are reported separately for all periods presented.  Enterprise Resource Planning ERP  In September 2009, the Company committed to a sale of its ERP business. We are actively pursuing a buyer and expect to complete this
sale by the end of the 2010 fiscal year. The Company has recorded a loss of $13million as of September30, 2009 relating to the impairment of long-term fixed assets and
goodwill of this business. 
In
fiscal 2008, this division also recorded a loss of $76million relating to goodwill. In fiscal2009, the division recorded a charge of $143million attributable
to a fixed price ERPcontract. These charges are included in losses from discontinued operations.  Security Solutions  On April30, 2008, the Company sold its Security Solutions division for cash proceeds of $46million, net of transaction
costs of $04million, and recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of $29million.  Unison MAXIMUS,Inc.  On May2, 2008, the Company sold its Unison MAXIMUS,Inc. subsidiary for proceeds of $65million. The sale
transaction is structured as a sale of stock to the management team of the subsidiary. The sale price of $65million consists of $01million in cash and $64million in the form
of a promissory note secured by 1a security interest in all of the assets of the former subsidiary; 2a pledge of shares by the buyer; and 3a personal guaranty by members
of the management team who are shareholders of the buyer. The Company has deferred recognition of a pre-tax gain on the sale of $39million, and interest income on the promissory
note, until realization is more fully assured. The deferred gain and deferred interest of $46million is reflected as a deduction from the note receivable on the consolidated balance sheet as
of September30, 2009.

Unbilled
accounts receivable and deferred revenue relate primarily to contracts wherein the timing of billings to customers varies based on individual contracts and often differs from
the period of revenue recognition. At September30, 2008 and 2009, there was $04million and $15million, respectively, billed
but not paid by customers pursuant to contractual retainage provisions. Such balances are included in billed accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. At
September30, 2008 and 2009, $22million of billed long-term contract receivables, net of reserves of $06million, are included in other assets. 
In
evaluating the net realizable value of accounts receivable, the Company considers such factors as current economic trends, customer credit-worthiness, and changes in the customer
payment terms and collection trends. Changes in the assumptions used in analyzing a specific account receivable may result in a reserve being recognized in the period in which the change occurs. Changes
in the reserves against billed accounts receivable were as follows in thousands:

Deductions
from reserves against billed accounts receivable in fiscal year 2008 of $272million include $219million related to the write-off of a
fully-reserved account receivable due from Accenture. The write-off of the fully-reserved account receivable due from Accenture arose from the related settlement with Accenture in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.

diluted loss per share as a result of their antidilutive effect. 
9. Credit Facilities  On January25, 2008, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement providing for a senior secured revolving credit facility, with SunTrust Bank as administrative agent,
issuing bank and swingline lender, and a syndicate of other lenders the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility provides for a $350million revolving line of credit commitment, which may be
used ifor revolving loans, iifor swingline loans, subject to a sublimit of $50million, and iiito request the issuance of letters of credit on the Company
behalf, subject to a sublimit of $250million. The Company may request an increase in the commitment under the Credit Facility, such that the aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility
shall at no time exceed $750million. The credit available under the Credit Facility may be used, among other purposes, to refinance the Company current indebtedness, to repurchase shares of
the Company capital stock and to finance the ongoing working capital, capital expenditure, and general corporate needs of the Company. Subject
to applicable conditions, the Company may elect interest rates on its revolving borrowings calculated by reference to ithe prime lending rate as announced by SunTrust
Bank or, if higher, the federal funds effective rate plus 050% a Base Rate Borrowing, or iithe reserve adjusted rate per annum equal to the offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars
for a one 1, two 2, three 3or six 6month period in the London Inter-Bank Market a LIBOR Borrowing, and, in each case, plus an applicable margin that is
determined by reference to the Company then-current leverage ratio. For swingline borrowings, the Company will pay interest at
the rate of interest for a one 1month LIBOR Borrowing, plus the applicable margin, or at a rate to be separately agreed upon by the Company and the administrative agent.

9. Credit Facilities Continued 
At
September30, 2009, the Company had issued three letters of credit totaling $103million. A letter of credit for $10million may be called by a customer in the
event that the Company defaults under the terms of a contract. The letter was renewed in March 2009 and expires in March 2010. Two letters of credit totaling $03million have been issued in
relation to the Company insurance policies. These letters of credit expire in May 2010 and may be renewed annually thereafter. The
Credit Facility matures on January25, 2013, at which time all outstanding borrowings must be repaid and all outstanding letters of credit must be terminated or cash
collateralized. 
The
Credit Facility, as amended by the Company and its lender on December12, 2008, provides for the payment of specified fees and expenses, including an up-front fee
and commitment and letter of credit fees, and contains customary financial and other covenants that require the maintenance of certain ratios including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed
charge coverage ratio. The Company was in compliance with all covenants in the amended Credit Facility as of September30, 2009. The Company obligations under the Credit Facility are
guaranteed by certain of the Company direct and indirect subsidiaries collectively, the Guarantors and are secured by substantially all of MAXIMUS' and the Guarantors' present and future
tangible and intangible assets, including the capital stock of subsidiaries and other investment property. 
At
September30, 2008 and 2009, the Company had performance bond commitments totaling $834million and $711million, respectively. 
10. Leases  The Company leases office space under various operating leases which typically contain clauses permitting cancellation upon certain conditions, including the early termination,
non-renewal or material alteration of the related customer contract. The terms of these leases typically provide for certain minimum payments as well as increases in lease payments based
upon the operating cost of the facility and the consumer price index. Rent expense for the years ended September30, 2007, 2008, and 2009 was $210million, $195million, and
$245million respectively.

11. Employee Benefit Plans and Deferred Compensation  The Company has 401k plans and other defined contribution plans for the benefit of all employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. The plans provide for Company match,
specified Company contributions, and/or discretionary Company contributions. During the years ended September30, 2007, 2008, and 2009, the Company contributed $32million 39million, and $32million to the plans, respectively. 
12. Income Taxes  Since October1, 2007, the Company has accounted for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon the technical
merits, it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting policy was an increase
in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $03million, which was accounted for as a decrease in the October1, 2007 balance of retained earnings on our consolidated balance
sheet. 
The
Company net unrecognized tax benefits totaled $20million and $19million at September30, 2008 and 2009, respectively. The total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits that, if recognized, would affect the annual effective income tax rate is $19million at September30, 2009. 
It
is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by as much as $06million within the next twelve months as a result of settlement of
audit issues, expiration of statute of limitations and/or payment of uncertain tax liabilities, which could have an impact on the effective tax rate. The anticipated reversals are related to state tax
items, none of which individually are significant. 
The
Company recognizes and presents uncertain tax positions on a gross basis i.e.,without regard to likely offsets for deferred tax assets, deductions, and/or credits that would
result from payment of
uncertain tax amounts. The reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in thousands:

The
Company files income tax returns in the United States Federal jurisdiction and in various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal income tax
examinations for
years before 2005 and is no longer subject to state and local, or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2003.

The
Company has elected to report interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. In the fiscal year ending September30, 2009, the Company recognized interest
expense relating to unrecognized tax benefits of less than $01million. The net liability balance at September30, 2008 and 2009 of $20 million and $19million includes
approximately $02 million and $03million, respectively, of interest and penalties.

We
do not provide for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, as we consider these to be permanently reinvested in the operations of such
subsidiaries. If some of these earnings were distributed, some countries may impose withholding taxes; in addition, as foreign taxes have been previously paid on these earnings, we would expect to be
entitled to a U.S. foreign tax credit that would reduce the U.S. taxes owed on such distributions. As at September 30, 2009, the approximate amount of earnings from Foreign subsidiaries is $208
million. The amount of taxes that may be applicable on earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives
the Company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings. 
As
of September30, 2009, the Company had $52million of net operating loss carryforwards related to a Canadian subsidiary. A full valuation allowance of
$18million has been established against the related deferred tax asset. These net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire at the end of fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2017. Cash
paid for income taxes during the years ended September30, 2007, 2008, and 2009 was $103million, $238million, and $241million, respectively.

Approximately
90% of the Company total goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.  13. Shareholders' Equity  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company Board of Directors established stock option plans during 1997 pursuant to which the Company may grant
non-qualified stock options to officers, employees and directors of the Company. Such plans also provide for stock awards and direct purchases of the Company common stock. At
September30, 2009, 16million shares remained available for grants under the Company stock plans. The Company typically issues new shares in satisfying its obligations under its
stock plans. 
The
Company previously granted stock options to certain employees. These were granted at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company common stock at the date of grant
and generally vest ratably over a period of four years. Options issued prior to fiscal 2005 expire ten years after date of grant; those issued since expire after six years. The Company has
transitioned towards providing Restricted Stock Units rather than options and, accordingly, no options have been granted since 2008. For the fiscal years ended September30, 2007, 2008, and
2009, compensation expense related to stock options was $08million, $27million, and $14million, respectively. 
The
Company issues Restricted Stock Units RSUs to officers, employees and directors of the Company under its 1997 Equity Incentive Plan Plan. Generally, these RSUs vest ratably
over six years with full vesting upon the sixth anniversary of the date of grant. The fair value of the RSUs, based on the Company stock price at the grant date, is expensed over the vesting period.
For the fiscal years ended September30, 2007, 2008 and 2009, compensation expense recognized related to RSUs was $31million, $68million and $59million, respectively. 
In
calculating stock-based compensation cost, the Company takes into account the expected fair value of the awards to be granted to employees and recognizes this over the service period.
The methodology for calculating fair value of stock options typically utilizes the Black-Scholes method. The valuation of RSUs is based upon the share price on the day of grant. The Company considers
the effect of estimated forfeitures and adjusts for changes in these estimates over the life of each grant. Stock-based compensation was $38million, $95million and
$73million for the fiscal years ended September30, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. During
the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company identified an error in prior periods in recorded stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and RSUs. The error was
due, in part, to how the software used by the Company applied estimated forfeiture rates to fully vested stock options and RSUs. The impact was to underestimate stock compensation expense by
$11million in each of fiscal 2006 and 2007. The Company corrected this error by recording additional stock compensation expense of $22million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The
total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation arrangements was $21million, $38million and $29million for the
fiscal years ended September30, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively.

weighted average fair value of stock options was estimated at the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing method with the following assumptions for the fiscal years
ended September30, 2007 and 2008: 
2007 
2008  Dividend yield 15 09 Risk-free interest rate 45 41 Expected volatility 37 33 Expected life of option term in years 43 43 Weighted average fair value at grant date 871 1412 
The
dividend yield is based on historical experiences and expected future changes. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time
of grant. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock. The expected life of the option is derived from historical data pertaining to option exercises and employee
terminations.

As
of September30, 2009, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options and RSUs was $08million and $148million,
respectively. This charge is expected to be realized over 20years for stock options and 55years for RSUs. Cash
flows resulting from the tax benefits generated from tax deductions in excess of the compensation costs recognized for those options and RSUs excess tax benefits are classified as
financing cash flows.  Employee Stock Purchase Plan  The Company previously offered an employee stock purchase plan ESPP that allowed eligible employees to purchase shares of the
Company common stock each quarter at 95% of the market value on the last day of the quarter. The ESPP was terminated in fiscal 2007 with 6,838 shares of common stock being acquired at an average
price of $2924. No expense was recorded relating to the ESPP.  Stock Repurchase Programs  On November14, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to
$1500million of the Company outstanding common stock under an Accelerated Share Repurchase ASR program. Under the ASR agreement, the Company acquired and retired 3,758,457 shares at an
initial price of $3991 per share for $1500million plus fees of approximately $04million. The counter-party purchased an equivalent number of shares in the open market over the
nine-month period ended August15, 2008. Pursuant to the ASR agreement, at its completion the Company initial price under the ASR agreement was adjusted down based on the
volume-weighted average price VWAP of the Company stock during this period. Such adjustment could be settled in cash or stock at the Company discretion. On July11, 2008, the
counter-party completed the purchase of shares in the open market, and the Company elected to receive the price adjustment of

in cash. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, this receipt of cash was recorded as a decrease to common stock in the full amount of $139million. Under
a resolution adopted in July 2008, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, at management discretion, of up to an aggregate of $750million of the Company
common stock. The resolution also authorized the use of option exercise proceeds for the repurchase of the Company common stock. Under the resolution, the Company acquired and retired 1,314,290
shares at an average price of $3356 per share for $441million. At September30, 2009, $567million remained available for future stock repurchases under the resolution. As of
November17, 2009, the Company has acquired 25,400common shares at a cost of $11million during the first quarter of fiscal2010. In
total, the Company repurchased 4,145,057 common shares at a cost of $1645million and 927,690 shares at a cost of $300million in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The
Company did not repurchase any shares in 2007. 
14. Commitments and Contingencies  Litigation  The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, including contract and employment claims, in the ordinary course of its business.
The matters reported on below involve significant pending or potential claims against us. 
aIn
December 2008, MAXIMUS, AccentureLLP and the Texas Health and Human Services Commission HHSC entered into an agreement settling all claims among the
parties arising from a prime contract between Accenture and HHSC for integrated eligibility services and a subcontract between MAXIMUS and Accenture in support of the prime contract. In connection
with that settlement, MAXIMUS paid a total of $400million and agreed to provide services to HHSC valued at an additional $100million. The Company primary insurance carrier paid
$125million of the amount due from MAXIMUS. In May 2009, the Company recovered an additional $63million from one of its excess insurance carriers. The Company continues to pursue
additional insurance recoveries from its other excess insurance carriers; however, such recoveries are not assured. 
bIn
November 2007, MAXIMUS was sued by the State of Connecticut in the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford. MAXIMUS had entered into a contract in 2003
with the Connecticut Department of Information Technology to update the State criminal justice information system. The State claims that MAXIMUS breached its contract and also alleges negligence and
breach of the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. MAXIMUS has sued its primary subcontractor on the effort ATS Corporation which abandoned the project before completing its
obligations. Although the State did not specify damages in its complaint, it demanded payment of alleged damages of approximately $62million in a letter sent to the Company in September 2007.
The Company denies that it breached its contract with the State. The Company cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings or any settlement negotiations or the impact they may have on the
Company operating results or financial condition. 
cIn
March 2009, a state Medicaid agency asserted a claim against MAXIMUS in the amount of $23million in connection with a contract MAXIMUS had through
February1, 2009 to provide

For the years ended September30, 2007, 2008 and 2009  14. Commitments and Contingencies Continued Medicaid
administrative claiming services to school districts in the state. MAXIMUS entered into separate agreements with the school districts under which MAXIMUS helped the districts prepare and
submit claims to the state Medicaid agency which, in turn, submitted claims for reimbursement to the Federal government. No legal action has been initiated. The state has asserted that its agreement
with MAXIMUS requires the Company to reimburse the state for the amounts owed to the Federal government. However, the Company agreements with the school districts require them to reimburse MAXIMUS
for such payments and therefore MAXIMUS believes the school districts are responsible for any amounts disallowed by the state Medicaid agency or the Federal government. Accordingly, the Company
believes its exposure in this matter is limited to its fees associated with this work and that the school districts will be responsible for the remainder. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009,
MAXIMUS recorded a $07million reduction of revenue reflecting the fees it earned under the contract. No additional charges have been recorded since then. MAXIMUS has exited the Federal
healthcare claiming business and no longer provides the services at issue in this matter. 
dIn
July 2009 the District of Columbia District initiated a civil action against MAXIMUS in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, Civil Division. The
District alleged violations of the District False Claims Act Act, fraud and unjust enrichment arising from the Company preparation and submission of federal Medicaid reimbursement claims on
behalf of the District. The District was seeking treble its actual damages plus a penalty of $10,000 per claim as provided under the Act. MAXIMUS previously settled a Federal investigation and related
whistleblower lawsuit concerning these same activities in 2007. In connection with that settlement, MAXIMUS entered into a two-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement DPA, a
five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement CIA and paid a settlement of $305million. The DPA has since expired by its terms and the CIA has been suspended in light of the
Company exit from the Federal health care claiming business. The District was, in fact, a named party in the prior whistleblower lawsuit that was dismissed with prejudice, and MAXIMUS believes that
the District claims are barred. In October 2009, the District voluntarily dismissed the matter without prejudice.  Employment Agreements  The Company has an employment agreement with its chief executive officer with a term ending in fiscal 2010. 
15. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Major Customers  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable, billed and unbilled. To date, these
financial instruments have been derived from contract revenue earned primarily from federal, state and local government agencies located in the United States. 
For
the years ended September30, 2007, 2008, and 2009, the Company derived approximately 18%, 16% and 11% respectively, of its consolidated revenue from contracts with the State
of California, principally within our Operations Segment.

quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period. Earnings
per share amounts are computed independently each quarter. As a result, the sum of each quarter earnings per share amount may not equal the total earnings per share amount for

18. Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141 revised SFAS141R, Business Combinations. This standard is included within the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification at ASC 805 Business Combinations. The new requirements are effective for business combinations entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008, which is the
Company 2010 fiscal year. As a consequence of the requirements, more transactions will be recorded as business combinations, as it changes the definitions of a business, which would no longer be
required to be self-sustaining or revenue generating, and a business combination, which would include combinations that occur by

18. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Continued contract
alone or due to changes in substantive participation rights, such as a lapse in minority veto rights. Certain acquired contingencies will be recorded initially at fair value on the
acquisition date. After the acquisition, if new information is available, contingent liabilities will be measured at the higher of the likely amount to be paid and the acquisition-date
fair value. Contingent assets will be measured subsequently at the lower of the current estimated future amount to be realized and the acquisition-date fair value. Transaction and
restructuring costs generally will be expensed as incurred. In partial acquisitions, companies generally will record 100percent of the assets and liabilities at fair value, including goodwill.
This will likely result in higher related depreciation and amortization charges in subsequent periods than under the current standard. The effect of the new requirements will depend upon the number
and size of businesses acquired in future years. 
Concurrent
with the issuance of SFAS141R, the FASB issued SFAS No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. This standard is included within
the FASB Accounting Standards Codification at ASC 810 Consolidation. The new requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008, which is the Company 2010
fiscal year. This statement will be applied prospectively as of October1, 2009 except for the presentation and disclosure requirements. The standard changes the accounting and reporting for
minority interests and requires the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled, and presented in the consolidated statement of financial
position within equity, but separate from the parent equity. It also requires that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly
identified and presented on the face of the consolidated
statement of income. At September30, 2009, the Company does not have a subsidiary with a significant noncontrolling interest and, accordingly, the effect of the adoption of these new
requirements is not expected to be material. 
On
September23, 2009, the FASB ratified EITF08-1, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables This standard has amended the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification at ASC 605 Revenue Recognition. The new requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after June15, 2010, which is the Company 2011 fiscal year. Early adoption of the
standard is allowed and various options for prospective or retroactive adoption are available. Where vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement
cannot be determined, a Company will be required to develop a best estimate of the selling price of separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price
method. These new requirements will not apply to many arrangements involving software, which will continue to require vendor specific objective evidence in assessing selling price. We are in the
process of reviewing and evaluating these new requirements and therefore their ultimate impact is not yet known. 
Concurrent
with the ratification of EITF08-1, the FASB ratified EITF09-3, Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements. This
standard has amended the FASB Accounting Standards Codification at ASC 985 Software. The new requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after June15, 2010, which is the Company
2011 fiscal year. Early adoption of the standard is allowed and various options for prospective or retroactive adoption are available. Under these requirements, tangible products which have software
components which are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will be scoped out of software revenue recognition guidance. We

Texas Integrated Eligibility Project  Our fiscal 2007 results were respectively impacted by a $252million operating loss on the Texas Integrated Eligibility project. Up until February 2007, we served as a
subcontractor to Accenture as part of the Texas Access Alliance, which provided services under the Texas Health and Human Services Commissions' TX HHSC Integrated Eligibility Program. We were
awarded the five-year, $370million subcontract in June 2005. In June 2006, we amended our subcontract with Accenture to reduce scope and realign responsibilities. In November 2006,
we announced that we commenced negotiations with Accenture to further reduce our scope on the project. In January 2007, we initiated arbitration to resolve certain disputes under the subcontract and
in February 2007, we terminated our subcontract with Accenture. In March 2007, the TX HHSC terminated its contract with Accenture and contracted directly with us to provide support services for its
State Children Health Insurance Program SCHIP and to provide enrollment broker services for its Medicaid program. We continue to provide services under these programs, but on a profitable basis.
See Note14. Commitments and Contingencies above for additional information. 
20. Legal and Settlement Expense Recovery, Net  Legal and settlement expense recovery consists of costs, net of reimbursed insurance claims, related to significant legal settlements and non-routine legal matters,
including future probable
legal costs estimated to be incurred in connection with those matters. Legal expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business are included in selling, general and administrative expense.

21. Sale of Corrections Services Business  On October5, 2006, the Company sold its Corrections Services business for proceeds of $19million, net of transaction costs of $08million, and recognized a
pre-tax gain on the sale of $05million. During the fiscal year ended September30, 2006, this business had revenue of $91million and generated an operating loss of
approximately $06million. 
22. Sale of Building  During the quarter ended June30, 2008, the Company sold a 21,000 square foot administrative office building in McLean, Virginia for proceeds of $59million, net of
transactions costs of $02million, and
recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of $39million. This gain has been classified as gain on sale of building in the consolidated statement of operations.  23. Fair Value Measurements  Effective October1, 2008, the Company is required to disclose the fair value of all financial assets subject to fair value measurement and the nature of the valuation techniques,
including their classification within the fair value hierarchy, utilized by the Company in performing these measurements. The only financial assets subject to fair value measurements held by the
Company at September30, 2009 were the Company cash and cash equivalents. These assets are considered to be 'Level1' assets as their valuation is based upon observable inputs such as
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. 
The
Company has taken advantage of a one year deferral in the requirement to provide fair value disclosures for non-financial assets and liabilities except for those that are
recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually. 
24. Subsequent Events  In preparing these financial statements, the Company management has evaluated subsequent events through November17, 2009, the date the financial statements were issued.  Dividend  On October9, 2009, the Company Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $012 for each share of the Company
common stock outstanding. The dividend will be paid on November30, 2009 to shareholders of record on November13, 2009. Based on the number of shares outstanding, the payment will be
approximately $21million.  Share Repurchases  As of November17, 2009, the Company has repurchased 25,400common shares at a cost of $11million during the
first quarter of fiscal2010.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and
principal financial
officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule13a-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form10-K. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods. 
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal
control over financial reporting as defined in Rule13a-15f under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of published financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2009. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on our
assessment, we believe that as of September30, 2009, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on criteria set forth by COSO in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework. 
The
attestation report concerning the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2009, issued by Ernst YoungLLP, the
independent registered public accounting firm who also audited our consolidated financial statements is included following this Item9A. 
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.During 2009, the Company completed the installation of a phased implementation of

Resource Planning ERP system, transferring the core financials for certain divisions of the Company to the new ERP system. We have updated the Company internal controls over financial reporting as
necessary to accommodate modifications to business processes or accounting procedures. However, the internal control design remained
substantially unchanged for the initial implementation. Further phases of implementation were implemented at the beginning of fiscal 2010 and these changes, as well as others planned for fiscal 2010,
will continue to be monitored and tested as part of management annual evaluation of internal control over financial reporting. 
Other
than the matter noted above, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f under
the Exchange Act identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal control that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter of 2009 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    
The
Board of Directors and Shareholders of MAXIMUS,Inc. 
We
have audited MAXIMUS,Inc. internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. MAXIMUS, Inc management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In
our opinion, MAXIMUS,Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2009, based on the COSO
criteria. 
We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the 2009 consolidated financial statements of
MAXIMUS,Inc. and our report dated November17, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
