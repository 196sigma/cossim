REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Amkor Technology, Inc.   In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of another auditor, the
consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Amkor Technology,
Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2000, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit. We did not audit the financial statements of Amkor Technology
Philippines P1/P2, Inc. and Amkor Technology Philippines P3/P4, Inc. both
wholly owned subsidiaries, collectively referred to herein as ATP, which
combined financial statements reflect total assets and operating expenses
including cost of revenues of 21% and 17%, respectively, of the related
consolidated totals at December 31, 2000 and for the year then ended. The
combined financial statements of ATP were audited by another auditor whose
report thereon has been furnished to us, and our opinion expressed herein,
insofar as it relates to the amounts included for ATP, is based solely on the
report of the other auditor. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction
with the related consolidated financial statements. We conducted our audit of
these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audit and the report of the other auditor provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND DOLLAR PER SHARE DATA
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amkor
Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All of the company subsidiaries are
wholly-owned except for a small number of shares of each of the Philippine
subsidiaries which are required to be owned by directors of these companies
pursuant to Philippine law. The consolidated financial statements reflect the
elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions. The
investments in and the operating results of 20% to 50% owned companies are
included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of
accounting.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain
previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current
presentation principally the presentation of the amortization of goodwill and
other acquired intangibles.
Foreign Currency Translation
Substantially all of the foreign subsidiaries and investee companies use
the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Accordingly, monetary assets and
liabilities which were originally denominated in a foreign currency are
translated into U.S. dollars at month-end exchange rates. Non-monetary items
which were originally denominated in foreign currencies are translated at
historical rates. Gains and losses from such translation and from transactions
denominated in foreign currencies are included in other income expense.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments, for which we are subject to credit risk, consist
principally of accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments. With respect to accounts receivable, we mitigate our credit risk by
selling primarily to well established companies, performing ongoing credit
evaluations and making frequent contact with customers. We have mitigated our
credit risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term
investments, through diversification of our holdings into various money market
accounts, U.S. treasury bonds, federal mortgage backed securities, high grade
municipal bonds, commercial paper and preferred stocks.
Risks and Uncertainties
Our future results of operations involve a number of risks and
uncertainties. Factors that could affect future operating results and cause
actual results to vary materially from historical results include, but are not
limited to, dependence on the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor
industry, uncertainty as to the demand from our customers over both the long-and
short-term, competitive pricing and declines in average selling prices we
experience, our dependence on our relationship with Anam Semiconductor, Inc.
ASI for all of our wafer fabrication output, our reliance on a relatively
small group of principal customers, the timing and volume of orders relative to
our production capacity, the absence of significant backlog in our business,
availability of manufacturing capacity and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,
the availability of financing, our high leverage and the restrictive covenants
contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, our competition, our
dependence on international operations and sales, our dependence on raw material
and equipment suppliers, exchange rate fluctuations, our dependence on key
personnel, our difficulties managing our growth, the enforcement of intellectual
property rights by or against us, our need to comply with existing and future
environmental regulations and the results of ASI as it impacts our financial
results.

AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months
or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
principally by using a moving average method.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is
calculated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
depreciable assets. Accelerated methods are used for tax purposes. Depreciable
lives follow                              
Buildings and  10 to 30 years
Machinery and   3 to 5 years
Furniture, fixtures and other   3 to 10 years   Cost and accumulated depreciation for property retired or disposed of are
removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in
earnings. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred. Depreciation expense was $2620 million, $1589 million and $1164
million for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles
Goodwill is recorded when there is an excess of the cost of an acquisition
over the fair market value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible
assets acquired. Acquired intangibles includes patents and workforce-in-place.
Goodwill and acquired intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over a
period of ten years. The unamortized balances recorded for goodwill and acquired
intangibles are evaluated periodically for potential impairment based on the
future estimated cash flows of the acquired businesses.
Other Noncurrent Assets
Other noncurrent assets consist principally of deferred debt issuance
costs, security deposits, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies,
deferred income taxes and tax credits.
Other Noncurrent Liabilities
Other noncurrent liabilities consist primarily of pension obligations and
noncurrent income taxes payable.
Income Taxes and Pro Forma Income Statement Data
Amkor Electronics, Inc. AEI, which was merged into our company just prior
to the initial public offering of our company in May 1998, elected to be taxed
as an S Corporation under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
and comparable state tax provisions. As a result, AEI did not recognize U.S.
federal corporate income taxes. Instead, the stockholders of AEI were taxed on

U.S. federal income taxes was recorded for AEI. The accompanying consolidated
statements of income include an unaudited pro forma adjustment to reflect income
taxes which would have been recorded if AEI had not been an S Corporation, based
on the tax laws in effect during the respective periods. Just prior to the
initial public offering, AEI terminated its S Corporation status at which point
the profits of AEI became subject to federal and state income taxes at the

represents the balance due from Mr. & Mrs. Kim and the Kim Family Trusts related
to the finalization of AEI tax returns.
Revenue Recognition and Risk of Loss
Our company does not take ownership of customer-supplied semiconductor
wafers. Title and risk of loss remains with the customer for these materials at
all times. Accordingly, the cost of the customer-supplied materials is not
included in the consolidated financial statements. Revenues from packaging
semiconductors and performing test services are recognized upon shipment or
completion of the services. We record wafer fabrication services revenues upon
shipment of completed wafers. Such policies are consistent with provisions in
the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative
instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
measured at its fair value. SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the
derivative fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific
hedge accounting criteria are met. Special accounting for qualifying hedges
allows a derivative gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged
item in the income statement, and requires that a company must formally
document, designate, and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive
hedge accounting. SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS No. 137, is effective for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. We will adopt this statement during
the first quarter of 2001 and we believe that the impact of adoption on the
financial statements will not be material.
2. RELATIONSHIP WITH ANAM SEMICONDUCTOR INC.
On May 1, 2000 we completed our purchase of ASI three remaining packaging
and test factories, known as K1, K2 and K3, for a purchase price of $9500
million. In addition we made a commitment to a $4590 million equity investment
in ASI. Pursuant to the commitment we made an equity investment in ASI of $3090
million on May 1, 2000. We fulfilled the remaining equity investment commitment
of $1500 million in three installments of which $300 million was invested on
June 30, 2000, $600 million was invested on August 30, 2000 and October 27,
2000. We financed the acquisition and investment with the proceeds of a $2588
million convertible subordinated notes offering, a $4100 million private equity
financing, $7500 million of new secured bank debt and approximately $103
million from cash on hand. As of December 31, 2000, we had invested a total of
$5006 million in ASI including an equity investment of $416 million made on
October 1999. We owned as of December 31, 2000 42% of the outstanding voting
stock of ASI. We will continue to report ASI results in our financial
statements through the equity method of accounting.
The amount by which the cost of our investment exceeds our share of the
underlying assets of ASI as of the date of our investment is being amortized on
a straight-line basis over a five-year period. The amortization is included in
our consolidated statement of income within equity in income of investees. As of
December 31, 2000, the unamortized excess of the cost of our equity investment
in ASI above our share of the underlying net assets is $1541 million.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
The acquisition of K1, K2 and K3 was accounted for as a purchase.
Accordingly, the results of K1, K2 and K3 have been included in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. Goodwill and
acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date were $5558 million and are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over a 10 year period. Acquired
intangibles include the value of acquired patent rights and of a
workforce-in-place. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed was approximately $394 million for fixed assets, $9 million for
inventory and other assets, and $9 million for assumed liabilities.
On May 17, 1999, we purchased ASI packaging and test business known as
K4. The purchase price for K4 was $5750 million in cash plus the assumption of
approximately $70 million of employee benefit liabilities. The acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, the results of K4 have been included
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the date of
acquisition. Goodwill and acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date were
$2229 million and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a 10 year
period. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was
approximately $359 million for fixed assets and $7 million for assumed
liabilities.
On July 1, 1999, we acquired the stock of Anam/Amkor Precision Machine
Company AAPMC for $38 million, which was paid to ASI during June 1999. AAPMC
supplies machine tooling used by us at our Philippine operations. As an interim
step to this acquisition, during April 1999, we assumed and repaid $57 million
of AAPMC debt. The acquisition was financed through available working capital
and was accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, the results of AAPMC have been
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the date of
acquisition and goodwill of approximately $20 million was recorded as of the
date of acquisition and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a ten
year period. The historical operating results of AAPMC are not material in
relation to our operating results.
On June 1, 1998, we purchased ASI 40% interest in Amkor/Anam Pilipinas,
Inc. AAP for $338 million. The acquisition was accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting which resulted in the elimination of the minority
interest liability reflected on the consolidated balance sheet and the recording
of approximately $239 million of goodwill which is being amortized over 10
years.
Pro Forma Financial Information for Amkor unaudited
The unaudited pro forma information below assumes that the May 2000
acquisition of K1, K2 and K3 occurred at the beginning of 2000 and 1999 and the
May 1999 acquisition of K4 had occurred at the beginning of 1999. The pro forma
adjustments include a provision for amortization of goodwill and other
identified intangibles, an adjustment of depreciation expense based on the fair
market value of the acquired assets, interest expense on debt issued to finance
the acquisitions and income taxes related to the pro forma adjustments. The pro
forma results are not necessarily indicative of the results we would actually
have achieved if the acquisition had been completed as of the beginning of each
of the periods presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of future
consolidated results.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
ASI business had been severely affected by the economic crisis in Korea.
ASI has traditionally operated with a significant amount of debt relative to its
equity and has contractually guaranteed the debt obligations of certain
affiliates and subsidiaries. ASI was part of the Korean financial restructuring
program known as Workout beginning in October 1998. The Workout program was
the result of an accord among Korean financial institutions to assist in the
restructuring of Korean business enterprises. The process involved negotiation
between the related banks and ASI, and did not involve the judicial system. The
Workout process restructured the terms of ASI bank debt, however, it did not
impact debts outstanding with trade creditors, including indebtedness with our
company. ASI operations continued uninterrupted during the process. ASI was
released from workout with its Korean creditor banks on July 18, 2000.
We have a long-standing relationship with ASI. ASI was founded in 1956 by
Mr. H. S. Kim, the father of Mr. James Kim, our Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer. Through our supply agreements with ASI, we historically have had a
first right to substantially all of the packaging and test services capacity of
ASI and the exclusive right to all of the wafer output of ASI wafer
fabrication facility. Beginning in May 2000 with our acquisition of K1, K2 and
K3, we no longer receive packaging and test services from ASI. Under the wafer
fabrication services supply agreement, we continue to have the exclusive right
to all of the wafer output of ASI wafer fabrication facility, and we expect to
continue to purchase all of ASI wafer fabrication services. Historically, we
have had other relationships with ASI affiliated companies for financial
services, construction services, materials and equipment. Total purchases from
ASI and its affiliates included in cost of revenue for the years ended December
31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $4998 million, $7145 million and $5738 million.
Additionally, other services performed by ASI and its affiliates included in
interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $16
million, $14 million and $22 million. Construction services and equipment
purchases received from ASI and its affiliates capitalized during the years
ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $388 million, $184 million and
$111 million.
3. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SALE AGREEMENT
Effective July 1997 we entered into an agreement to sell receivables with
certain banks. The transaction qualified as a sale under the provisions of SFAS
No. 125 Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities. Under the agreement, the participating banks
committed to purchase, with limited recourse, all right, title and interest in
selected accounts receivable, up to a maximum of $1000 million. Losses on
receivables sold under the agreement were approximately $11 million, $43
million and $47 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, and are included
in other expense, net. In March 2000, we terminated the agreement and
repurchased approximately $715 million of accounts receivable.

In March 2000, we issued $2588 million of convertible subordinated notes
due March 2007. The notes accrue interest at a rate of 5% per annum and are
convertible into Amkor common stock at any time at a conversion price of $5734
per share. The 575% convertible subordinated notes due May 2003 are convertible
into Amkor common stock at any time at a conversion price of $1350 per share.
In May 2000, we incurred $7500 million of secured bank debt related to our
acquisition of K1, K2 and K3 and investment in ASI. The secured bank debt
consists of a $9000 million secured bank facility that includes a $2000
million revolving credit line and two term loans with interest rates that vary
with LIBOR. The secured bank debt provides for amortization of the drawn amount
over a five to a five and one-half year period and quarterly principal and
interest payments. Under the terms of the secured bank facility, we are required
to make mandatory prepayments out of a portion of any excess cash flow, as
defined in the agreement, as well as out of net proceeds of certain asset sales
and the net proceeds of certain issuances of debt or equity securities, subject
to certain exceptions. The bank facility is secured by our domestic assets,
certain intercompany loans and our equity investment in ASI. The bank facility
includes financial covenants, as well as covenants restricting our ability to
incur debt, pay dividends, make certain investments and payments and encumber or
dispose of assets. Such covenants have been amended in 2000 and January 2001 to
provide for greater flexibility in making investments in acquisitions, joint
ventures and capital expenditures. The senior notes and senior subordinated
notes also contain restrictive covenants.
In connection with our issuance of the convertible notes due March 2007 and
our secured bank facility during the year ended December 31, 2000, we incurred
debt issuance costs of $93 million and $202 million. The debt issuance costs
have been deferred and amortized over the life of the associated debt and are
included, net of amortization, in other noncurrent assets in the consolidated
balance sheet.
During the fourth quarter of 1999 and continuing into 2000, we completed an
early conversion of the 575% convertible subordinated notes due May 2003.
During the year ended December 31, 2000, we exchanged approximately 248,000
shares of our common stock for $32 million of the convertible subordinated

AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
notes. During the year ended December 31, 1999, we exchanged 121 million shares
of common stock for $1536 million of convertible subordinated notes. The fair
value of the shares of common stock issued in excess of the shares required for
conversion of the notes was $03 million and $174 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and such amounts were expensed and are
included in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
At December 31, 1999, short-term borrowings consisted of various operating
lines of credit and working capital facilities which were repaid in their
entirety and no short-term facilities were outstanding as of December 31, 2000.
For 1999, the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was 117%.
Interest expense related to short-term borrowings and long-term debt is
presented net of interest income of $142 million, $199 million and $91
million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income. The principal payments required under long-term debt
borrowings at December 31, 2000 are as follows: 2001 -- $736 million,
2002 -- $736 million, 2003 -- $1237 million, 2004 -- $2381 million,
2005 -- $2664 million and thereafter -- $8838 million.
8. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
In connection with a $4100 million private equity offering in May 2000, we
issued 205 million shares of our common stock and granted warrants that expire
four years from issuance to purchase 39 million additional shares of our common
stock at $2750 per share. The estimated fair value of the stock warrants of
$350 million is included in additional paid-in capital on our consolidated
balance sheet.
9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
U.S. Defined Contribution Plan
Our company has a defined contribution benefit plan covering substantially
all U.S. employees. Employees can contribute up to 13% of salary to the plan and
the company matches 75% of the employee contributions up to a defined maximum
on an annual basis. The expense for this plan was $18 million, $18 million and
$14 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Philippine Pension Plan
Our Philippine subsidiaries sponsor a defined benefit plan that covers
substantially all employees who are not covered by statutory plans. Charges to

As a result of our 2000 acquisition of K1, K2 and K3, we received the
benefit of a 100% tax holiday that applies for seven years from the acquisition
and then a 50% tax holiday for three additional years. During 2000 one of our
Philippine subsidiaries received a partial tax holiday. The 2000 granted tax
holidays are in addition to the previously granted holidays in Korea and the
Philippines. The foreign exchange losses gains recognized for income taxes
relate to unrecognized net foreign exchange losses gains on U.S. dollar
denominated monetary assets and liabilities. During 2000 our Philippine
subsidiary realized net foreign exchange gains and losses for book purposes
which are deferred for tax. Our ability to utilize these assets depends on the
timing of the settlement of the related assets or liabilities and the amount of
taxable income

recognized within the Philippine statutory carryforward limit of three years.
During 2000, our Philippine subsidiary established a valuation allowance for a
portion of the related deferred tax assets. During 2000 the company recognized
certain reductions in its current liability through additional tax credits
including a U.S. research and development credit and recognized certain
reductions from prior year tax accruals.
Our company has U.S. net operating losses for tax purposes totaling $161
million and $18 million for 2000 and 1999, available for carryback up to 2
years and carryforward up to 20 years, expiring in 2019 and 2020. Non-U.S.
income before taxes and minority interest was approximately $201 million, $740
million and $540 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. At December 31,
2000, undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled approximately
$3135 million. Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for these
undistributed earnings because it is our intention to reinvest such
undistributed earning outside the U.S. An estimated $724 million in U.S. income
and foreign withholding taxes would be due if these earnings were remitted as
dividends.
At December 31, 2000 and 1999 current deferred tax assets of $135 million
and $58 million, respectively, are included in other current assets and
noncurrent deferred tax assets of $23 million and $23 million, respectively,
are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The net deferred
tax assets include amounts, which, in our opinion, are more likely than not to
be realizable through future taxable income. In addition, at December 31, 2000
and 1999, noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $42 million and $48 million,
respectively, are included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheet.
Our tax returns have been examined through 1994 in the Philippines and
through 1996 in the U.S. The tax returns for open years are subject to changes
upon final examination. Changes in the mix of income from our foreign
subsidiaries, expiration of tax holidays and changes in tax laws or regulations
could result in increased effective tax rates in the future.
11. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS of No. 128, Earnings
Per Share, requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share
on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed using only the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period while
diluted EPS is computed assuming conversion of all dilutive securities, such as
options. The 5% convertible subordinated notes due 2007 and the warrants issued
May 2000 are antidilutive for the periods presented and therefore are not
included in the EPS calculation. The basic and diluted per share amounts for the
years presented, including unaudited pro forma earnings per share for December
31, 1998, are calculated as follows                                   WEIGHTED

12. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS
1998 Director Option Plan. A total of 300,000 shares of common stock have
been reserved for issuance under the Director Plan. The option grants under the
Director Plan are automatic and non-discretionary. Generally, the Director Plan
provides for an initial grant of options to purchase 15,000 shares of common
stock to each new non-employee director of the company when such individual
first becomes an Outside Director. In addition, each non-employee director will
automatically be granted subsequent options to purchase 5,000 shares of common
stock on each date on which such director is re-elected by the stockholders of
the company, provided that as of such date such director has served on the Board
of Directors for at least six months. The exercise price of the options is 100%
of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. The term of each
option is ten years and each option granted to an non-employee director vests
over a three year period. The Director Plan will terminate in January 2008
unless sooner terminated by the Board of Directors.
1998 Stock Plan. The 1998 Stock Plan generally provides for the grant to
employees, directors and consultants of stock options and stock purchase rights.
Unless terminated sooner, the 1998 Plan will terminate automatically in January
2008. A total of 5,000,000 shares have been reserved for issuance under the 1998
Stock Plan with provision for an annual replenishment to bring the share
reserved for issuance under the plan to 5,000,000 shares as of each January 1.
Unless determined otherwise by the Board of Directors or a committee
appointed by the Board of Directors, options and stock purchase rights granted
under the 1998 Plan are not transferable by the optionee. Generally, the
exercise price of all stock options granted under the 1998 Plan must be at least
equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant. In general,
the options granted will vest over a four year period and the term of the
options granted under the 1998 Plan may not exceed ten years.
1998 Stock Option Plan for French Employees. Unless terminated sooner, the
French Plan will continue in existence until 2003. The French Plan provides for
the granting of options to employees of our French subsidiaries. A total of
250,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the French
Plan with provision for an annual replenishment to bring the share reserved for
issuance under the plan to 250,000 shares as of each January 1. In general,
stock options granted under the French Plan vest over a four year period, the
exercise price for each option granted under the French Plan shall be 100% of
the fair market value of the shares of common stock on the date the option is
granted and the maximum term of the option must not exceed ten years. Shares
subject to the options granted under the French Plan may not be

stock have been made available for sale under the Stock Purchase Plan and an
annual increase is to be added on each anniversary date of the adoption of the
Purchase Plan. Employees including officers and employee directors of the
company but excluding 5% or greater stockholders are eligible to participate if
they are customarily employed for at least 20 hours per week. The Stock Purchase
Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock through payroll
deductions, which may not exceed 15% of the compensation an employee receives on
each payday. Each participant will be granted an option on the first day of a
two year offering period, and shares of common stock will be purchased on four
purchase dates within the offering period. The purchase price of the common
stock under the Purchase Plan will be equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair
market value per share of common stock on the start date of the offering period
or on the purchase date. Employees may end their participation in an offering
period at any time, and participation ends automatically on termination of
employment with the company. The Purchase Plan will terminate in January 2008,
unless sooner terminated by the Board of Directors.
For the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, employees purchased
common stock shares under the stock purchase plan of 263,498, 586,755 and 0,

The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined using
available market information and appropriate methodologies; however,
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the
estimates for fair value. Accordingly, these estimates are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange.
Certain of these financial instruments are with major financial institutions and
expose us to market and credit risks and may at times be concentrated with
certain counterparties or groups of counterparties. The creditworthiness of
counterparties is continually reviewed, and full performance is anticipated.
The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for short-term
investments, due from affiliates, other accounts receivable, due to affiliates,
accrued expenses and accrued income taxes approximate fair value due
58

AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
to the short-term nature of these instruments. The methods and assumptions used
to estimate the fair value of other significant classes of financial instruments
is set forth below      Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are due on
demand or carry a maturity date of less than three months when purchased.
The carrying amount of these financial instruments is a reasonable estimate
of fair value.
Available for sale investments. The fair value of these financial
instruments was estimated based on market quotes, recent offerings of
similar securities, current and projected financial performance of the
company and net asset positions.
Long-term debt. The carrying amount of our total long-term debt as
December 31, 2000 was $1,586 million and the fair value based on available
market quotes is estimated to be $1,483 million.
14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
We are involved in various claims incidental to the conduct of our
business. Based on consultation with legal counsel, management does not believe
that any claims, either individually or in the aggregate, to which we are a
party will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results
of operations.
We are disputing certain amounts due under a technology license agreement
with a third party. To date, this dispute has not involved the judicial systems.
We have accrued our estimate of amounts due under this agreement. However,
depending on the outcome of this dispute, the ultimate amount payable by us, as
of December 31, 2000, could be up to $126 million.
Net future minimum lease payments under operating leases that have initial

Amounts paid for this lease in 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $12 million, $11
million and $11 million, respectively.
We have various purchase commitments for materials, supplies and capital
equipment incidental to the ordinary conduct of business. As of December 31,
2000 we had commitments for capital equipment of approximately $63 million. In
the aggregate, such commitments are not at prices in excess of current market.
15. SEGMENT INFORMATION
In accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, we have two reportable segments, packaging
and test services and wafer fabrication services.
59
61
AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
These segments are managed separately because the services provided by each
segment require different technology and marketing strategies.
Packaging and Test Services. Through our four factories located in the
Philippines and our four factories located in Korea, we offer a complete and
integrated set of packaging and test services including IC packaging design,
leadframe and substrate design, IC package assembly, final testing, burn-in,
reliability testing and thermal and electrical characterization.
Wafer Fabrication Services. Through our wafer fabrication services
division, we provide marketing, engineering and support services of ASI deep
submicron CMOS foundry, under a long-term supply agreement.
We derive substantially all of our wafer fabrication revenues from Texas
Instruments TI. Total net revenues derived from TI accounted for 141% and
165% of net revenues in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Total net revenues for
services provided to TI prior to 1999 were less than 10%. Intel Corporation,
accounted for approximately 141% and 206% of net revenues in 1999 and 1998,
respectively. Revenues for services provided to Intel for 2000 did not exceed
10%. Our company five largest customers collectively accounted for 348 436% and 416% of net revenues in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The
companies that constitute our five largest customers have varied from year to
year.
The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as those
described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate
our operating segments based on operating income. Summarized financial
information concerning our reportable segments is shown in the following table.
The Other column includes the elimination of inter-segment balances and
corporate assets which include cash and cash equivalents, non-operating balances
due from affiliates, investment in ASI and TSTC and other investments.

16. SUBSEQUENT EVENT UNAUDITED
Joint Venture with Toshiba Corporation. In January 2001, we began
operating a joint venture with Toshiba Corporation providing semiconductor
assembly and test services in Japan. We own 60% of the joint venture company and
will acquire the remaining 40% by the end of the third year of the joint venture
operation for a price to be determined based on the performance of the joint
venture during the three year period but at a purchase price which can not
exceed approximately $40 million subject to exchange rate fluctuations. The
joint venture took over the operations of the existing assembly facility at a
Toshiba facility and continues to provide packaging and test services for
Toshiba under a long-term agreement.
Offering of Senior Notes. In February 2001, we sold $5000 million
principal amount of our 925% senior notes due 2008 in a private placement. We
used $3875 million of the $4900 million of the net proceeds of this offering
to repay amounts outstanding under our secured bank facilities, and the balance
of the net proceeds was available to be used for general corporate and working
capital purposes. In March 2001, we amended the secured bank facilities to relax
certain of the covenants and to provide us with additional operating
flexibility.
Acquisitions in Taiwan. On March 7, 2001, we announced that in separate
transactions, that we will acquire Taiwan Semiconductor Corporation TSTC and
Sampo Semiconductor Corporation SSC in Taiwan. Both TSTC and SSC signed
letters of intent enabling negotiations to proceed. Both agreements are expected
to be finalized in April 2001. The purchase price will be paid principally
through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock.
