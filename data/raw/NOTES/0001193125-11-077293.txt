Controls and Procedures. We maintain
disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Furthermore, our controls and procedures can be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected on a timely basis. 
An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form10-K. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective at a reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report. REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL
OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
for our company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with managements authorization; and providing
reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Furthermore, our controls and procedures can be circumvented by the individual acts of
some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected on a timely basis. Management conducted its evaluation of the effectiveness of our companys internal controls over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation, management concluded that our companys internal control over financial reporting was effective at a reasonable assurance level as of
December31, 2010. There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
December31, 2010 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject
to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only managements report in this annual report. Item1B.
