Item8. Inherent in the application of many of these
accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates
and judgments in the determination of certain revenues,
expenses, assets and liabilities. As such, materially different
financial results can occur as circumstances change and
additional information becomes known. The policies with the
greatest potential effect on our results of operations and
financial position include The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment
of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the
aging of the accounts receivable. If there were a deterioration
of a major customers creditworthiness, or actual defaults
were higher than our historical experience, our estimates of the
recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, which
could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Our revenue recognition policy is significant because our
revenue is a key component of our results of operations. In
addition, our revenue recognition determines the timing of
certain expenses, such as commissions and royalties. We follow
very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenues;
however, certain judgments affect the application of our revenue
policy. Revenue results are difficult to predict, and any
shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause
our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to
quarter. We assess the impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill at
least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors
we consider important which could trigger an impairment review
include the following   
significant underperformance relative to expected historical or
projected future operating results 27 Table of Contents   
significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired
assets or the strategy for our overall business; and     
significant negative industry or economic trends. When we determine that the carrying value of long-lived assets
and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of
one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure
any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method
using a discount rate determined by our management to be
commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business
model. Net long-lived assets, including goodwill, amounted to
$3174million as of December31, 2005. Recent Developments On February9, 2006, we acquired substantially all of the
assets of Creative Designs International, Ltd. and a related
Hong Kong company, Arbor Toys Company Limited collectively
Creative Designs. The total initial purchase price
of $1077million consisted of $1045million in cash,
150,000 shares of our common stock at a value of approximately
$32million and the assumption of liabilities in the
amount of $35million. In addition, we agreed to pay an
earn-out of up to an aggregate amount of $200million in
cash over the three calendar years following the acquisition
based on the achievement of certain financial performance
criteria, which will be recorded as goodwill when and if earned.
Creative Designs is a leading designer and producer of dress-up
and role-play toys and will be included in our results of
operations beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated,

Comparison of the Years Ended December31, 2005 and
2004 Net Sales. Net sales were $6615million in 2005
compared to $5743million in 2004, representing an
increase of $872million or 152%. The increase in net
sales was primarily due to an increase in sales of our
Traditional Toy products of $719million, which includes
the addition of 28 Table of Contents 548million in sales from product lines acquired in our
Play Along acquisition, and increases in WWE action figures and
accessories, wheels products, Cabbage Patch Kids,
Doodle
Bear
and Sky
Dancers,
offset in part by decreases in TV Games, dolls, other
action figures and Care Bears and Teletubbies
products; and an increase in International sales of
$307million, including increases in sales of TV
Games, action figures and wheels product. The net increase
in net sales was partially offset by decreases in sales of our
Crafts and Activities and Writing instruments of
$191million and our Seasonal products of
$55million. Our Funnoodle line was adversely
impacted by competition at retail in 2005. We have secured
alternate sources of manufacturing for the Funnoodle
products resulting in lower costs which we expect will
enable us to expand distribution of this product line in 2006.
Additionally, net sales in 2005 included approximately
$98million of Pet Pal products. With the addition of Creative Designs International, Ltd. in
2006, and our other
on-going initiatives in
product development and marketing, we believe that the increased
level of net sales of Traditional Toys should continue
throughout 2006. See Forward Looking Information. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased $407million,
or 180%, to $2667million, or 403% of net sales, in 2005
from $2260million, or 394% of net sales, in 2004. The
overall increase in gross profit was attributable to the
increase in net sales. The increase in gross profit margin of
09% of net sales was primarily due to lower product costs and
tool and mold amortization, offset in part by an increase in
royalty expense as a percentage of net sales due to changes in
the product mix to more products with higher royalty rates from
products with lower royalty rates or proprietary products with
no royalties and the write-off of advances and guarantees
related to expired or discontinued licenses in 2005. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling,
general and administrative expenses were $1787million in
2005 and $1723million in 2004, constituting 270% and
300% of net sales, respectively. The overall increase of
$64million in such costs was primarily due to increases
in direct selling expenses $173million, product
development costs $40million and general and
administrative expenses $10million, partially offset by
a decrease in amortization expense related to intangible assets
other than goodwill and trademarks $50million and
stock-based compensation expense $102million.
Comparable grants of restricted stock awards and the increase in
the price of our common stock in 2004 compared to a decrease in
the price of our common stock in 2005 resulted in
astock-based compensation expense of $34million in
2005 compared to an expense of $136million in 2004. The
increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due
to additional overhead related to the operations of Play Along
and increases in bonus expense $36million and donation
expense $56million, offset in part by decreases in
legal costs $50million, bad debt expense
$20million and rent expense $13million. The
increase in direct selling expenses is primarily due to an
increase in advertising and promotional expenses of
$121million in 2005 in support of the sell-through of our
various products at retail. We produce and air television
commercials in support of several of our product lines. From
time to time, we may increase or decrease our advertising
efforts, if we deem it appropriate for particular products. Profit from Video Game Joint Venture. Profit from our
video game joint venture in 2005 was $94million, as
compared to $79million in 2004, due to the release of
four new games and stronger sales of existing titles in 2005,
offset by the payment of $08million to THQ for their
share of profit on our sales of WWE themed TV Games compared to
2004, in which period three new games were released and no
payments were made by us to THQ. The amount of the preferred
return we will receive after June30, 2006 is subject to
change see Risk Factors. 29 Table of Contents Other Expense. Other expense in 2005 of $14million
relates to the write-off of an investment in a Chinese joint
venture. There were no such expenses in 2004. Interest, Net. Interest income increased due to higher
average cash balances and higher interest rates during 2005
compared to 2004. Interest expense of $45million for the
convertible senior notes payable was comparable to 2004. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes
included Federal, state and foreign income taxes at effective
tax rates of 263% in 2004 and 343% in 2005, benefiting from a
flat 175% Hong Kong Corporation Tax on our income arising in,
or derived from, Hong Kong for each of 2004 and 2005. The
increase in the effective tax rate in 2005 is due to a greater
proportion of taxable income generated in the United States. As
of December31, 2005, we had net deferred tax assets of
approximately $72million for which no allowance has been
provided since, in the opinion of management, realization of the
future benefit is probable. In October 2004, the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 the Act was signed into law.
The Act created a one-time incentive for U.S. corporations to
repatriate undistributed earnings from their international
subsidiaries by providing an 85% dividends-received deduction
for certain international earnings. The deduction was available
to corporations during the tax year that includes October 2004,
or in the immediately subsequent tax year. In the fourth quarter
of 2005, our Board of Directors approved a plan to repatriate
$1750million in foreign earnings, which was completed in
December 2005. The Federal and state income tax expense related
to this repatriation was approximately $80million. Comparisons of the Years Ended December31, 2004 and
2003 Net Sales. Net sales were $5743million in 2004
compared to $3158million in 2003, representing an
increase of 819%. This increase in net sales was primarily due
to the addition of $1516million in sales of traditional
toys from our recent Play Along acquisition, as well as the
addition of i$1475million in sales of some of our
other traditional toy products, including primarily TV Games
with 15titles in release in 2004, as compared to
3titles in release in 2003 and WWE action figures and
accessories; and ii$237million in international
sales including $139million by Play Along. The increase
in net sales was offset in part by decreases in sales of our
crafts and activities and writing instruments of
$482million and our seasonal products, including water
guns and junior sports toys, of $161million. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased $996million,
or 788%, to $2260million, or 394% of net sales, in 2004
from $1264million, or 400% of net sales, in 2003. The
overall increase in gross profit was attributable to the
significant increase in net sales. The decrease in gross profit
margin of 06% of net sales was primarily due to an increase in
royalty expense as a percentage of net sales due to changes in
the product mix to more products with higher royalty rates from
products with lower royalty rates or proprietary products with
no royalties. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling,
general and administrative expenses were $1723million in
2004 and $1131million in 2003, constituting 300% and
358% of net sales, respectively. The overall increase of
$592million in such costs was primarily due to the impact
of stock-based compensation $52million, an increase in
legal fees and settlements $68million and bonus expense
$45million, an increase in amortization expense related
to intangible assets other than goodwill acquired in the Play
Along acquisition and the addition of overhead related to the
operations of Play Along $272million. Due to the
increases in our grants of restricted stock awards and the price
of our common stock in 2004, compared to a moderate 30 Table of Contents increase in the price of our common stock in 2003, we had
stock-based compensation charges of $136million compared
to $84million in 2003. The increase in direct selling
expenses $193million is primarily due to an increase in
advertising and promotional expenses in 2004 in support of the
sell-through of our various products at retail. We produced and
aired television commercials in support of several of our
products, including World Wrestling Entertainment,
Dragon Ball and Mucha
Lucha
action figures, TV Games, Care Bears, Cabbage
Patch Kids and Flying Colors products in 2004, and
World Wrestling Entertainment and Dragon Ball
action figures and Flying Colors products in 2003.
From time to time, we may increase our advertising efforts, if
we deem it appropriate for particular products. Product Recall Costs There were no product recall costs
in 2004. In the second quarter of 2003, we accrued a
$27million charge for the recall of one of our products,
and in the third quarter of 2003, we recorded a credit of
$07million for the recovery of recall costs from one of
our third-party factories. The remaining component of the product recall costs is as

Profit from Video Game Joint Venture. Profit from joint
venture increased by $05million in 2004 due to the joint
venture having lower unit sales at lower wholesale prices of its
two vehicle combat games of the five games released in 2003
compared to releasing all new titles with higher unit sales at
higher wholesale prices in addition to having higher sales of
carryover titles in 2004. New releases typically generate higher
unit sales resulting in higher overall sales as compared to
carryover titles. Profit from the joint venture contributed
significantly to our pre-tax profit, representing 222% of
pre-tax income in 2003 and 127% in 2004. We expect to continue
to receive a preferred return over the remaining term of the
license agreement ending December31, 2009, although we
cannot predict with certainty what levels of return will be
achieved and, in any case, we anticipate substantial
fluctuations in the amount of the preferred return distributed
to us from year to year. Interest, Net. Interest income increased due to higher
average cash balances during 2004 than in 2003, but was offset
by interest expense of $45million related to the
convertible notes issued in June2003. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes
included Federal, state and foreign income taxes in 2003 and
2004, at an effective tax rate of 83% and 263%, respectively,
benefiting from a flat 175%Hong Kong Corporation Tax on
our income arising in, or derived from, Hong Kong for 2003 and
2004. For 2004, the effective rate increased as a result of the
recognition of U.S.taxes on a greater proportion of
foreign earnings deemed to be subject to U.S.taxes. As of
December31, 2004, we had net deferred tax assets of
approximately $19million. In making this determination,
management believes it considered all available evidence, both
positive and negative, as well as the weight and importance
given to such evidence. 31 Table of Contents Quarterly Fluctuations and Seasonality We have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in
operating results and anticipate these fluctuations in the
future. The operating results for any quarter are not
necessarily indicative of results for any future period. Our
first quarter is typically expected to be the least profitable
as a result of lower net sales but substantially similar fixed
operating expenses. This is consistent with the performance of
many companies in the toy industry. The following table presents our unaudited quarterly results for
the years indicated. The seasonality of our business is
reflected in this quarterly presentation.

Due to the restatement in 2003 relating to the accounting of the
Toymax, Trendmasters and PM acquisitions and to rounding,
some of the figures above may differ from our previously filed
Quarterly Reports on
Form10-Q. During the second quarter of 2003, we recorded a charge which
impacted operating income by approximately $27million
relating to the recall of one of our products. During the third quarter of 2003, we recovered $07million
of the recall costs, recorded in the second quarter of 2003,
from one of our factories. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a non-cash charge
of $84million which impacted operating income relating to
the grant of restricted stock and a charge of $21million
to provision for bad debt impacting operating income relating to
the bankruptcy filing of several of our customers, including Kay
BeeToys. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded non-cash charges,
which impacted operating income, of $56million relating
to the grant of restricted stock and $86million relating
to the amortization of short-lived intangible assets acquired in
connection with the Play Along acquisition. During the second quarter of 2005, we wrote-off our
$14million investment in a Chinese joint venture to Other
Expense on our determination that none of the value would be
realized. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded a non-cash
charge, which impacted net income, of $36million for
restricted stock, and we repatriated $1750million from
our Hong Kong subsidiaries which resulted in incremental income
tax expense of $80million and reduced net income. 32 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Standards We use the intrinsic-value method of accounting for stock
options granted to employees. As required by our existing stock
plans, stock options are granted at, or above, the fair value of
our stock, and, accordingly, no compensation expense is
recognized for these grants in the consolidated statement of
operations. We record compensation expense related to other
stock-based awards, such as restricted stock grants, over the
period the award vests. Issued in December 2004, SFAS123
revised 2004, Share-Based Payment
SFAS123R, amends SFAS123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and
SFAS95 Statement of Cash Flows.
SFAS123R requires companies to measure all employee
stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and
record such expense in its consolidated financial statements,
and requires additional accounting and disclosure related to the
income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share-based
payment arrangements. SFAS123R is effective for us
beginning as of January1, 2006. The adoption of
SFAS123Rs fair value method will have an impact on
our results of operations, although it will have no impact on
our overall financial position. While we cannot estimate the
level of share-based payments to be issued in the future, based
on the stock options that are currently outstanding, we expect
that the adoption of SFAS123R will result in a charge to
operations in 2006 of approximately $27million. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December31, 2005, we had working capital of
$3015million, as compared to $2295million as of
December31, 2004. This increase was primarily attributable
to our operating results. Operating activities provided net cash of $711million in
the year ended December31, 2005, as compared to
$1314million in 2004. Net cash was provided primarily by
net income of 635million, non-cash charges and changes in
working capital. Our cash position was improved by accounts
receivable turnover as measured by days sales outstanding in
accounts receivable decreasing from approximately 50days
as of December31, 2004 to approximately 47days as of
December31, 2005 primarily due to a shift in sales from
domestic sales origin to FOB China, which carry shorter payment
terms, a shift in domestic sales to customers with shorter
payment terms and overall improved collection efforts and
results. Other than open purchase orders, issued in the normal
course of business, we have no obligations to purchase finished
goods from our manufacturers. As of December31, 2005, we
had cash and cash equivalents of $2402million. Our investing activities used cash of $95million in the
year ended December31, 2005, as compared to
$733million in 2004, consisting primarily of the purchase
of office furniture and equipment and molds and tooling used in
the manufacture of our products, and the goodwill and other
intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Pet Pal, plus
the $100million in goodwill relating to the earn-out of
Play Along, partially offset by the sale of marketable
securities $190million. In 2004, our investing activities
consisted primarily of the purchase of molds and tooling used in
the manufacture of our products, the purchase of other assets,
the goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in the
acquisition of Play Along, partially offset by the sale of
marketable securities. As part of our strategy to develop and
market new products, we have entered into various character and
product licenses with royalties generally ranging from 1% to 12%
payable on net sales of such products. As of December31,
2005, these agreements required future aggregate minimum
guarantees of $289million, exclusive of
$149million in advances already paid. 33 Table of Contents Our financing activities provided net cash of $32million
in the year ended December31, 2005, as compared to
$16million in 2004. In 2005, cash was primarily provided
from the exercise of stock options. In 2004, cash was primarily
provided from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by
the repayment of debt. The following is a summary of our significant contractual cash
obligations for the periods indicated that existed as of
December31, 2005 and is based on information appearing in
the notes to the consolidated financial statements in

In February 2003, our Board of Directors approved a buyback of
up to $200million of our common stock. During 2003, we
repurchased and retired 554,500shares of our common stock
for a total of approximately $61million. Although there
were no common stock repurchases during 2004 and 2005, we
evaluate buyback opportunities on an ongoing basis and will buy
back the approximately $139million of common stock still
available under our buyback program if and when we deem such a
repurchase to be in our best interests. In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the
Act was signed into law. The Act created a one-time
incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate undistributed
earnings from their international subsidiaries by providing an
85% dividends-received deduction for certain international
earnings. The deduction was available to corporations during the
tax year that includes October 2004, or in the immediately
subsequent tax year. In the fourth quarter of 2005, our Board of
Directors approved a plan to repatriate $1750million in
foreign earnings, which was completed in December 2005. The
Federal and state income tax expense related to this
repatriation was approximately $80million. In June 2004, we purchased substantially all of the assets and
assumed certain liabilities of Play Along, Inc., Play Along
Hong Kong Limited and PA Distribution, Inc. collectively
Play Along. The total initial purchase price of
$857million consisted of cash paid in the amount of
$708million and the issuance of 749,005shares of
our common stock valued at $149million. In addition, we
agreed to pay an earn-out of up to $100million per year
for the four calendar years following the acquisition up to an
aggregate amount of $300million based on the achievement
of certain financial performance criteria which will be recorded
as goodwill when and if earned. For the years ended
December31, 2004 and 2005, $100million and
$67million of the earn-out was earned and recorded as
goodwill, respectively. Accordingly, the annual maximum earn-out
for the remaining two years through December31, 2007 is
approximately $67million, or an aggregate of
$133million. Our results of operations have included Play
Along from the date of acquisition. 34 Table of Contents In October 2004, we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit
commenced by WWE the WWE Action. The complaint
also named as defendants, among others, the joint venture with
THQ Inc., certain of our foreign subsidiaries and our three
executive officers. In November 2004, several purported class
action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York, alleging damages
associated with the facts alleged in the WWE Action. Three
shareholder derivative actions have also been filed against us,
nominally, and against certain of our Board members the
Derivative Actions. The Derivative Actions seek to
hold the individual defendants liable for damages allegedly
caused to our Company by their actions, and, in one of the
Derivative Actions, seeks restitution to our Company of profits,
benefits and other compensation obtained by them. See
Legal Proceedings. On June13, 2005, we purchased substantially all of the
operating assets and assumed certain liabilities relating to the
Pet Pal line of pet products, including toys, treats and related
pet products. The total initial purchase price of
$106million was paid in cash. In addition, we agreed to
pay an earn-out of up to an aggregate amount of
$250million in cash over the three fiscal years following
the acquisition based on the achievement of certain financial
performance criteria, which will be recorded as goodwill when
and if earned. Goodwill of $46million arose from this
transaction, which represents the excess of the purchase price
over the fair value of assets acquired less liabilities assumed.
This acquisition expands our product offerings and distribution
channels. Our results of operations have included Pet Pal from
the date of acquisition. On February9, 2006, we acquired substantially all of the
assets of Creative Designs International, Ltd. and a related
Hong Kong company, Arbor Toys Company Limited collectively
Creative Designs. The total initial purchase price
of $1077million consisted of $1045million in cash,
150,000 shares of our common stock at a value of approximately
$32million and the assumption of liabilities in the
amount of $35million. In addition, we agreed to pay an
earn-out of up to an aggregate amount of $200million in
cash over the three calendar years following the acquisition
based on the achievement of certain financial performance
criteria, which will be recorded as goodwill when and if earned.
Creative Designs is a leading designer and producer of dress-up
and role-play toys and will be included in our results of
operations beginning in the first quarter of 2006. In June 2003, we sold an aggregate of $980million of
4625% Convertible Senior Notes due June15, 2023. The
notes may be converted into shares of our common stock at an
initial conversion price of $2000per share, subject to
certain circumstances. Cash interest is payable at an annual
rate of 4625% of the principal amount at issuance, from the
issue date to June15, 2010, payable on June15 and
December15 of each year, commencing on December15,
2003. After June15, 2010, interest will accrue on the
outstanding notes until maturity. At maturity, we will redeem
the notes at their accreted principal amount, which will be
equal to $1,81195 181195% per $1,000principal amount
at issuance, unless redeemed or converted earlier. We may redeem the notes at our option in whole or in part
beginning on June15, 2010, at 100% of their accreted
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
payable in cash. Holders of the notes may also require us to
repurchase all or part of their notes on June15, 2010, for
cash, at a repurchase price of 100% of the principal amount per
note plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Holders of the
notes may also require us to repurchase all or part of their
notes on June15, 2013 and June15, 2018 at a
repurchase price of 100% of the accreted principal amount per
note plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Any repurchases
at June15, 2013 and June15, 2018 may be paid in
cash, in shares of common stock or a combination of cash and
shares of common stock. 35 Table of Contents We believe that our cash flows from operations and cash and cash
equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and
capital expenditure requirements and provide us with adequate
liquidity to meet our anticipated operating needs for at least
the next 12months. Although operating activities are
expected to provide cash, to the extent we grow significantly in
the future, our operating and investing activities may use cash
and, consequently, this growth may require us to obtain
additional sources of financing. There can be no assurance that
any necessary additional financing will be available to us on
commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We intend to finance
our long-term liquidity requirements out of net cash provided by
operations and cash and cash equivalents. Exchange Rates Sales from our United States and Hong Kong operations are
denominated in U.S. dollars and our manufacturing costs are
denominated in either U.S. or Hong Kong dollars. Operations and
operating expenses of all of our operations are denominated in
local currency, thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange
rates. Changes in the Hong Kong dollar or British Pound/U.S.
dollar exchange rate may positively or negatively affect our
operating results. The exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar to
the U.S. dollar has been fixed by the Hong Kong government since
1983 at HK$780 to US$100 and, accordingly, has not represented
a currency exchange risk to the U.S. dollar. We cannot assure
you that the exchange rate between the United States and Hong
Kong currencies will continue to be fixed or that exchange rate
fluctuations between the United States and Hong Kong and United
Kingdom currencies will not have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows due to
adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and
rates. We are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in
United States and international borrowing rates and changes in
foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, we are exposed to
market risk in certain geographic areas that have experienced or
remain vulnerable to an economic downturn, such as China. We
purchase substantially all of our inventory from companies in
China, and, therefore, we are subject to the risk that such
suppliers will be unable to provide inventory at competitive
prices. While we believe that, if such an event were to occur we
would be able to find alternative sources of inventory at
competitive prices, we cannot assure you that we would be able
to do so. These exposures are directly related to our normal
operating and funding activities. Historically and as of
December31, 2005, we have not used derivative instruments
or engaged in hedging activities to minimize our market risk. Interest Rate Risk In June 2003, we issued convertible senior notes payable of
$980million with a fixed interest rate of 4625% per
annum, which remain outstanding as of December31, 2005.
Accordingly, we are not generally subject to any direct risk of
loss arising from changes in interest rates. 36 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Risk We have wholly-owned subsidiaries in HongKong and in the
United Kingdom. Sales are made by these operations on FOB China
or HongKong terms and are denominated in
U.S.dollars. However, purchases of inventory and
HongKong operating expenses are typically denominated in
HongKong dollars and operating expenses made in the United
Kingdom are typically denominated in British Pounds, thereby
creating exposure to changes in exchange rates. Changes in the
British Pound or HongKong dollar/ U.S.dollar
exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our gross
margins, operating income and retained earnings. The British
Pound gave rise to the other comprehensive loss in the balance
sheet at December31, 2005. The exchange rate of the
HongKong dollar to the U.S.dollar has been fixed by
the HongKong government since 1983 at HK$780 to US$100
and, accordingly, has not represented a currency exchange risk
to the U.S.dollar. We do not believe that near-term
changes in these exchange rates, if any, will result in a
material effect on our future earnings, fair values or cash
flows, and therefore, we have chosen not to enter into foreign
currency hedging transactions. We cannot assure you that this
approach will be successful, especially in the event of a
significant and sudden change in the value of the HongKong
dollar or British Pound. 37 Table of Contents Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders JAKKS Pacific, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
JAKKS Pacific, Inc. and Subsidiaries Company as of
December31, 2004 and 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, other comprehensive income,
stockholders equity and cash flows and the financial
statement schedule for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December31, 2005. We also have audited
managements assessment, included in the accompanying
Managements annual report on internal control over
financial reporting, that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these
financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements, an opinion on managements assessment, and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements
assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 38 Table of Contents In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and
schedule referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of JAKKS Pacific, Inc. and
Subsidiaries as of December31, 2004 and 2005, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December31, 2005 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also in our opinion, managements
assessment that JAKKS Pacific, Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
Furthermore, in our opinion, JAKKS Pacific, Inc. and
Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO.

development, production and marketing of consumer products,
including toys and related products, stationery and writing
instruments and pet toys and related products, some of which are
based on highly-recognized entertainment properties and
character licenses. The Company commenced its primary business
operations in July 1995 through the purchase of substantially
all of the assets of a Hong Kong toy company. The Company
markets its product lines domestically and internationally. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Delaware in January 1995. Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. In consolidation, all
significant inter-company balances and transactions are
eliminated. Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid assets, having an
original maturity of less than three months, to be cash
equivalents. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposits
which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The
Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The
Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit
risk on cash and cash equivalents. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual future results
could differ from those estimates. Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized upon the shipment of goods to customers or
their agents, depending on terms, provided that there are no
uncertainties regarding customer acceptance, the sales price is
fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured
and not contingent upon resale. Generally, the Company does not allow for product returns. The
Company provides a negotiated allowance for breakage or defects
to its customers, which is recorded when the related revenue is
recognized. However, the Company does make occasional exceptions
to this policy and consequently accrues a return allowance in
gross sales based on historic return amounts and management
estimates. The Company also will occasionally grant credits to facilitate
markdowns and sales of slow moving merchandise. These credits
are recorded as a reduction of gross sales at the time of
occurrence. The Companys reserve for sales returns and
allowances increased by $19million from
$232million as of December31, 2004 to
$251million as of December31, 2005. This increase is 45 Table of Contents JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued due primarily to the increase in sales in 2005 and an increase
in sales of electronic products which have higher defective
rates, offset in part by the timing of customer deductions. Inventory Inventory, which includes the ex-factory cost of goods,
capitalized warehouse costs and in-bound freight and duty, is
valued at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or market and

Marketable securities Marketable securities are categorized as available for sale and
related unrealized holding gains or losses are included as a
component of stockholders equity. At December31,
2005, the Company had no marketable securities. At
December31, 2004 cost approximated fair market value. Fair value of financial instruments The Companys cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities and accounts receivable represent financial
instruments. The carrying value of these financial instruments
is a reasonable approximation of fair value. The fair value of
the $980million of convertible senior notes payable at
December31, 2005 was approximately $1195million
based on the quoted market price. Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and are being

Shipping and handling costs The consolidated financial statements reflect the adoption of
the classification or disclosure requirements pursuant to
Emerging Issues Task Force EITF
00-10, Accounting
for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs, which was
effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. Consistent with
EITF 00-10, the Company
has historically classified income from freight charges to
customers in Net sales. The Company classifies
shipping and handling costs in Selling, general and
administrative expenses. Such costs amounted to
approximately $52million in 2003, $36million in
2004 and $31million in 2005. 46 Table of Contents JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Advertising Production costs of commercials and programming are charged to
operations in the year during which the production is first
aired. The costs of other advertising, promotion and marketing
programs are charged to operations in the year incurred.
Advertising expense for the years ended December31, 2003,
2004 and 2005, was approximately $124million 264million and $388million, respectively. The Company also participates in cooperative advertising
arrangements with some customers, whereby it allows a discount
from invoiced product amounts in exchange for customer purchased
advertising that features the Companys products.
Typically, theses discounts range from 1% to 6% of gross sales,
and are generally based on product purchases or on specific
advertising campaigns. Such amounts are accrued when the related
revenue is recognized or when the advertising campaign is
initiated. These cooperative advertising arrangements are
accounted for as direct selling expenses. Income taxes The Company does not file a consolidated return with its foreign
subsidiaries. The Company files Federal and state returns and
its foreign subsidiaries each file Hong Kong returns and United
Kingdom returns, as applicable. Deferred taxes are provided on a
liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized as
deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax
credit carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are
recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary
differences are the differences between the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets
are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes
in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. Translation of foreign currencies Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Hong Kong dollars
or British Pounds Sterling are translated into United States
dollars at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet
date. Transactions during the period are translated at the rates
ruling at the dates of the transactions. Profits and losses resulting from the above translation policy
are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and
statements of other comprehensive income. Accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets Long-lived assets, which include property and equipment,
goodwill and intangible assets other than goodwill, are
evaluated at least annually for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows from the use of these assets.
When any such impairment exists, the related assets will be
written down to fair value. Goodwill and other intangible assets In July 2001, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No141, Business Combinations
SFAS141 and SFAS142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets SFAS142
were issued. SFAS141 requires that all business
combinations completed after its 47 Table of Contents JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued adoption in July 2001 be accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting and establishes specific criteria for the
recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill. In
accordance with the adoption of SFAS142 on January1,
2002, goodwill and certain other intangible assets are no longer
amortized and are tested for impairment at least annually at the
reporting unit level. Losses in value are recorded when and as
material impairment has occurred in the underlying assets or
when the benefits of the identified intangible assets are
realized. As of December31, 2005, there was no impairment
to the underlying value of goodwill or intangible assets other
than goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill is based on managements
current assessment of recoverability. Management evaluates
recoverability using both objective and subjective factors.
Objective factors include managements best estimates of
projected future earnings and cash flows and analysis of recent
sales and earnings trends. Subjective factors include
competitive analysis and the Companys strategic focus. Intangible assets other than goodwill consist of product
technology rights, trademarks, acquired backlog, customer
relationships, product lines and license agreements. Intangible
assets other than trademarks are amortized over the estimated
economic lives of the related assets. Accumulated amortization
as of December31, 2004 and 2005 was $282million and
$320million, respectively. Stock Option Plans At December31, 2005, the Company had stock-based employee
compensation plans, which are described more fully in
Note16. The Company accounts for those plans under the
recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related Interpretations, and the disclosure provisions provided
by SFAS123, Accounting for
Stock-Based
Compensation. No stock-based employee compensation cost is
reflected in net income, as all options granted under those
plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. However, certain
options had been repriced resulting in compensation adjustments,
which have been reflected in net income. The following table
illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if
the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS123, to stock-based employee compensation. 48 Table of Contents JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued In 2003, 2004 and 2005 the fair value of each employee option
grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions used:
risk-free rate of interest of 4%, 225% and 425%, respectively;
dividend yield of 0%; with volatility of 82%, 1369% and 1302 respectively; and expected lives of five years.

Recent Accounting
Standards The Company uses the intrinsic-value method of accounting for
stock options granted to employees. As required by the
Companys existing stock plans, stock options are granted
at, or above, the fair value of the Companys stock, and,
accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized for these
grants in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company
records compensation expense related to other stock-based
awards, such as restricted stock grants, over the vesting period
of the award. Issued in December 2004, SFAS123 revised
2004, Share-Based Payment
SFAS123R, amends SFAS123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and
SFAS95 Statement of Cash Flows.
SFAS123R requires companies to measure all employee
stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and
record such expense in its consolidated financial statements,
and requires additional accounting and disclosure related to the
income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share-based
payment arrangements. SFAS123R is effective for the
Company beginning as of January1, 2006. The adoption of
SFAS123Rs fair value method will have an impact on
the Companys results of operations, although it will have
no impact on its overall financial position. While the Company
cannot estimate the level of share-based payments to be issued
in the future, based on the stock options that are currently
outstanding, the Company expects that the adoption of
SFAS123R will result in a charge to operations in 2006
of approximately $27million. 50 Table of Contents JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year balances

Wal-Mart has increased its percentage of the toy industrys
sales at retail and the increase in the dollar amount of sales
to Wal-Mart is consistent with this change. No other customer
accounted for more than 10% of our total net sales. At December31, 2004 and 2005, the Companys three
largest customers accounted for approximately 581% and 730 respectively, of net accounts receivable. The concentration of
the Companys business with a relatively small number of
customers may expose the Company to material adverse effects if
one or more of its large customers were to experience financial
difficulty. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of
its top customers and maintains an allowance for potential
credit losses. Note4 Joint Ventures The Company owns a fifty percent interest in a joint venture
with a company that develops, publishes and distributes
interactive entertainment software for the leading hardware game
platforms in the home video game market. The joint venture has
entered into a license agreement with an initial license period
expiring December31, 2009 under which it acquired the
exclusive worldwide right to publish video games on all hardware
platforms. The Companys investment is accounted for using
the cost method due to the financial and operating structure of
the venture and its lack of control over the joint venture. The
Companys basis consists primarily of organizational costs,
license costs and recoupable advances and is being amortized
over the term of the initial license period. The joint venture
agreement provides for the Company to receive guaranteed
preferred returns through June30, 2006 at varying rates of
the joint ventures net sales depending on the cumulative
unit sales and platform of each particular game. For periods
after June30, 2006, the 53 Table of Contents JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued amount of the preferred return will be subject to change between
the parties. This change will, in all likelihood, result in
modifications to the amount of preferred return that the Company
receives. The preferred return is accrued in the quarter in
which the licensed games are sold and the preferred return is
earned. The Companys joint venture partner retains the
financial risk of the joint venture and is responsible for the
day-to-day operations, including development, sales and
distribution, for which they are entitled to any remaining
profits. In addition, THQ is entitled to receive a preferred
return based on the sale of WWE TVGames. During 2005, the
Company paid THQ approximately $08million which is
recorded as a reduction of profit from the joint venture. During
2003, 2004 and 2005, the Company earned $74million 79million and $94million, respectively, in net
profit from the joint venture. During 2005, the Company wrote-off its $14million
investment in a Chinese joint venture to Other Expense on its
determination that none of the value would be realized. Note5 Business Combinations The Company acquired the following entities to further enhance
its existing product lines and to continue diversification into
other toy categories and seasonal businesses. On June13, 2005, the Company purchased substantially all
of the operating assets and assumed certain liabilities relating
to the Pet Pal line of pet products, including toys, treats and
related pet products. The total initial purchase price of
$106million was paid in cash. In addition, the Company
agreed to pay an earn-out of up to an aggregate amount of
$250million in cash over the three fiscal years following
the acquisition based on the achievement of certain financial
performance criteria, which will be recorded as goodwill when
and if earned. Goodwill of $46million arose from this
transaction, which represents the excess of the purchase price
over the fair value of assets acquired less the liabilities
assumed. This acquisition expands the Companys product
offerings and distribution channels. The Companys results
of operation have included Pet Pal from the date of acquisition.
Proforma results of operations are not provided since the
amounts are not material to the consolidated results of
operations. In June 2004, the Company purchased substantially all of the
assets and assumed certain liabilities of Play Along. The total
initial purchase price of $857million consisted of cash
paid in the amount of $708million and the issuance of
749,005 shares of the Company common stock valued at
$149million and resulted in goodwill of
$678million. In addition, the Company agreed to pay an
earn-out of up to $100million per year for the three
calendar years following the acquisition up to an aggregate
amount of $300million based on the achievement of certain
financial performance criteria which will be recorded as
goodwill when and if earned. For the years ended
December31, 2004 and 2005, $100million and
$67million of the earn-out was earned and recorded as
goodwill, respectively. Accordingly, the annual maximum earn-out
for the remaining two years through December31, 2007 is
approximately $67million, or an aggregate of
$133million. Play Along designs and produces traditional
toys, which it distributes domestically and internationally.
This acquisition expands the Companys product offerings in
the pre-school area and
brings new product development and marketing talent to the
Company. This transaction has been accounted for by the Company
under the purchase method of accounting, and the Companys
results of operations have included Play Along from the date of
acquisition. In determining the purchase price allocation of the Play Along
acquisition, the Company considered the acquired intangible
assets that arise from contractual or other legal rights,
including 54 Table of Contents JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued trademarks, copyrights, patents and license agreements,
potential noncontractual intangible assets, including customer
lists and customer-related relationships, as well as the value
of synergies that will result from combining the operations of
Play Along into the operations of the Company. The total purchase price of the Play Along acquisition including
the earn-outs earned through December31, 2005 in the
amount of $167million, which was allocated to goodwill,
was allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed as set forth in the following table

purposes. The following unaudited pro forma information represents the
Companys consolidated results of operations as if the
acquisition of Play Along had occurred on January1, 2004
and after giving effect to certain adjustments including the
elimination of certain general and administrative expenses and
other income and expense items not attributable to ongoing
operations, interest expense, and related tax effects. Such pro
forma information does not purport to be indicative of operating
results that would have been reported had the acquisition of
Play Along actually occurred on January1, 2004 or on

56 Table of Contents JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Note 8 Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that subject the Company to concentration
of credit risk are cash and cash equivalents and accounts
receivable. Cash equivalents consist principally of short-term
money market funds. These instruments are short-term in nature
and bear minimal risk. To date, the Company has not experienced
losses on these instruments. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers financial condition, but does not require
collateral to support domestic customer accounts receivables.
Most goods shipped FOB Hong Kong or China are secured with
irrevocable letters of credit. At December31, 2004 and 2005, the Companys three
largest customers accounted for approximately 581% and 730 respectively, of net accounts receivable. The concentration of
the Companys business with a relatively small number of
customers may expose the Company to material adverse effects if
one or more of its large customers were to experience financial
difficulty. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of
its top customers and maintains an allowance for potential
credit losses. Note 9Accrued Expenses Accrued expenses consist of the following in thousands

The current portion of deferred tax assets is included in
prepaid expenses and other. In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the
Act was signed into law. The Act created a one-time
incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate undistributed
earnings from their international subsidiaries by providing an
85% dividends-received deduction for certain international
earnings. The deduction was available to corporations during the
tax year that includes October 2004, or in the immediately
subsequent tax year. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the
Companys Board of Directors approved a plan to repatriate
$1750million in foreign earnings, which was completed in
December 2005. The Federal and State income tax expense related
to this repatriation was approximately $80million. 59 Table of Contents JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Income tax expense varies from the U.S.Federal statutory

Deferred taxes result from temporary differences between tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in
the consolidated financial statements. The temporary differences
result from costs required to be capitalized for tax purposes by
the U.S.Internal Revenue Code IRC, and
certain items accrued for financial reporting purposes in the
year incurred but not deductible for tax purposes until paid. As of December31, 2005, the Company has federal and state
net operating loss carryforwards of $90million and
$222million, respectively, expiring through 2023. These
carryforwards resulted from the acquisitions of Pentech and
Toymax. The utilization of these losses to offset future income
is limited under IRC382. The Companys management
concluded that a deferred tax asset valuation allowance was not
necessary. The components of income before provision for income taxes are
