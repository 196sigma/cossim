ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMETNS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING
Lockheed Martin Corporation
- 
The management of Lockheed Martin prepared and is responsible for the
consolidated financial statements and all related financial information
contained in this Annual Report. The consolidated financial statements, which
include amounts based on estimates and judgments, have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
In recognition of its responsibility for the integrity and objectivity of
data in the financial statements, the Corporation maintains a system of internal
accounting controls designed and intended to provide reasonable assurance, based
on an appropriate cost to benefit relationship, that assets are safeguarded and
transactions are properly executed and recorded. An environment that provides
for an appropriate level of control consciousness is maintained and monitored
and includes examinations by an internal audit staff and by the independent
auditors in connection with their reviews of interim financial information and
their annual audit.
Essential to the Corporation internal control system is management
dedication to the highest standards of integrity, ethics and social
responsibility. In connection therewith, management has issued the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and written policy statements that cover, among
other topics, environmental protection, potentially conflicting outside
interests of employees, proper business practices, and adherence to high
standards of conduct and practices in dealings with customers, including the
U.S. Government. The importance of ethical behavior is regularly communicated to
all employees through the distribution of the Code of Ethics and Business
Conduct, and through ongoing education and review programs designed to create a
strong compliance environment.
The Audit and Ethics Committee of the Board of Directors is composed of six
outside directors. This Committee meets periodically with the independent
auditors, internal auditors and management to review their activities. Both the
independent auditors and the internal auditors have unrestricted access to meet
with members of the Audit and Ethics Committee, with or without management
representatives present.
The Audit and Ethics Committee recommends to the Board of Directors the
selection of the independent auditors, which is then submitted to the
stockholders of the Corporation for ratification. The consolidated financial
statements included in this Annual Report have been audited by Ernst & Young
LLP, whose report follows. s/ Christopher E. Kubasik

Board of Directors and Stockholders
Lockheed Martin Corporation
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Lockheed
Martin Corporation as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Corporation management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Lockheed Martin Corporation at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.
As discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
in 2001 the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, and in
1999 adopted the provisions of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants' Statement of Position No. 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up
Activities.

Lockheed Martin Corporation
December 31, 2001

Note 1--Significant Accounting Policies
Organization--Lockheed Martin Corporation Lockheed Martin or the Corporation
is engaged in the conception, research, design, development, manufacture,
integration and operation of advanced technology systems, products and services.
Its products and services range from aircraft, spacecraft and launch vehicles to
missiles, electronics and information systems. The Corporation serves customers
in both domestic and international defense and commercial markets, with its
principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government.
Basis of consolidation and use of estimates--The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned
entities which the Corporation controls. Intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions, including
estimates of anticipated contract costs and revenues utilized in the earnings
recognition process, that affect the reported amounts in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Classifications--Receivables and inventories are primarily attributable to
long-term contracts or programs in progress for which the related operating
cycles are longer than one year. In accordance with industry practice, these
items are included in current assets. Certain amounts for prior years have been
reclassified to conform with the 2001 presentation.
Cash and cash equivalents--Cash equivalents are generally composed of highly
liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Due
to the short maturity of these instruments, carrying value on the Corporation
consolidated balance sheet approximates fair value.
Receivables--Receivables consist of amounts billed and currently due from
customers, and include unbilled costs and accrued profits primarily related to
revenues on long-term contracts that have been recognized for accounting
purposes but not yet billed to customers. As such revenues are recognized,
appropriate amounts of customer advances and progress payments are reflected as
an offset to the related accounts receivable balance.
Inventories--Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net
realizable value. Costs on long-term contracts and programs in progress
represent recoverable costs incurred for production, allocable operating
overhead and, where appropriate, research and development and general and
administrative expenses. Pursuant to contract provisions, agencies of the U.S.
Government and certain other customers have title to, or a security interest in,
inventories related to such contracts as a result of advances and progress
payments. Such advances and progress payments are reflected as an offset against
the related inventory balances. General and administrative expenses related to
commercial products and services provided essentially under commercial terms and
conditions are expensed as incurred. Costs of other product and supply
inventories are principally determined by the first-in, first-out or average
cost methods.
Property, plant and equipment--Property, plant and equipment are carried
principally at cost. Depreciation is provided on plant and equipment generally
using accelerated methods during the first half of the estimated useful lives of
the assets; thereafter, straight-line depreciation generally is used. Estimated
useful lives generally range from 10 years to 40 years for buildings and 5 years
to 15 years for machinery and equipment.
Investments in equity securities--Investments in equity securities include the
Corporation ownership interests in affiliated companies accounted for under
the equity method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, which
generally applies to investments that represent a 20 to 50 percent ownership of
the equity securities of the investees, the Corporation share of the earnings
or losses of the affiliated companies is included in other income and expenses.
The Corporation recognizes currently gains or losses arising from issuances of
stock by wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries, or by equity method
investees. These gains or losses are also included in other income and expenses.
Investments in equity securities also include the Corporation ownership
interests in companies in which its investment represents less than 20 percent.
If classified as available for sale, these investments are accounted for at fair
value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income,
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.  
Page 55  
Otherwise, these investments are generally accounted for under the cost method
of accounting.
Goodwill and other intangible assets--Intangible assets related to contracts and
programs acquired are amortized over the estimated periods of benefit 15 years
or less and are displayed in the consolidated balance sheet net of accumulated
amortization of $1,239 million and $1,085 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. In periods prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 see discussion
under the caption New accounting pronouncements in this Note, goodwill was
amortized ratably over appropriate periods, generally 30 to 40 years; however,
beginning January 1, 2002, goodwill will no longer be amortized. Goodwill is
displayed on the consolidated balance sheet net of accumulated amortization of
$1,380 million and $1,160 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill will be evaluated for potential impairment annually
by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including
goodwill recorded by the reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the fair
value, impairment is measured by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to
its carrying value, and any impairment determined is recorded in the current
period.
Customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred-- The Corporation
receives advances and progress payments from customers in excess of costs
incurred on certain contracts, including contracts with agencies of the U.S.
Government. Such advances and progress payments, other than those reflected as
an offset to accounts receivable or inventories as discussed above, are
classified as current liabilities.
Environmental matters--The Corporation records a liability for environmental
matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
can be reasonably estimated. A substantial portion of these costs are expected
to be reflected in sales and cost of sales pursuant to U.S. Government agreement
or regulation. At the time a liability is recorded for future environmental
costs, an asset is recorded for estimated future recovery considered probable
through the pricing of products and services to agencies of the U.S. Government.
The portion of those costs expected to be allocated to commercial business is
reflected in cost of sales at the time the liability is established.
Sales and earnings--Sales and anticipated profits under long-term fixed-price
production contracts are recorded on a percentage of completion basis, generally
using units of delivery as the measurement basis for effort accomplished.
Estimated contract profits are taken into earnings in proportion to recorded
sales. Sales under certain long-term fixed-price contracts which, among other
things, provide for the delivery of minimal quantities or require a significant
amount of development effort in relation to total contract value, are recorded
upon achievement of performance milestones or using the cost-to-cost method of
accounting where sales and profits are recorded based on the ratio of costs
incurred to estimated total costs at completion.
Sales under cost-reimbursement-type contracts are recorded as costs are
incurred. Applicable estimated profits are included in earnings in the
proportion that incurred costs bear to total estimated costs. Sales of products
and services provided essentially under commercial terms and conditions are
recorded upon shipment or completion of specified tasks.
Amounts representing contract change orders, claims or other items are
included in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is
probable. Incentives or penalties and awards applicable to performance on
contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded
when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance.
Incentive provisions which increase or decrease earnings based solely on a
single significant event are generally not recognized until the event occurs.
When adjustments in contract value or estimated costs are determined, any
changes from prior estimates are generally reflected in earnings in the current
period. Anticipated losses on contracts are charged to earnings when identified.
Research and development and similar costs--Corporation-sponsored research and
development costs primarily include independent research and development and bid
and proposal efforts related to government products and services. Except for
certain arrangements described below, these costs are generally included as part
of the general and administrative costs that are allocated among all contracts
and programs in progress under U.S. Government contractual arrangements.
Corporation-sponsored product development costs not otherwise allocable are
charged to expense when incurred. Under certain arrangements in  
Page 56  
which a customer shares in product development costs, the Corporation portion
of such unreimbursed costs is expensed as incurred. Customer-sponsored research
and development costs incurred pursuant to contracts are accounted for as
contract costs.
Impairment of certain long-lived assets--Generally, the carrying values of
long-lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment if events or
changes in the facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may
not be recoverable. Any impairment determined is recorded in the current period
and is measured by comparing the fair value of the related asset to its carrying
value.
Derivative financial instruments--The Corporation sometimes uses derivative
financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates
and foreign exchange rates. Effective January 1, 2001, the Corporation began to
account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The effect of
adopting SFAS No. 133 was not material to the Corporation consolidated results
of operations, cash flows or financial position. Under SFAS No. 133, all
derivatives are recorded as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheet, and periodically adjusted to fair value. The classification of
gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is
dependent on the intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation.
Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives that are not
considered highly effective hedges are reflected in earnings. Adjustments to
reflect changes in fair values of derivatives that are considered highly
effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by
corresponding adjustments related to the fair values of the hedged items, or
reflected in other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction matures and
the entire transaction is recognized in earnings. The change in fair value of
the ineffective portion of a hedge is immediately recognized in earnings.
Interest rate swap agreements are designated as effective hedges of the
fair value of certain existing fixed rate debt instruments. Forward currency
exchange contracts are designated as qualifying hedges of cash flows associated
with firm commitments or specific anticipated transactions. At December 31,
2001, the fair values of interest rate swap agreements and forward currency
exchange contracts outstanding, as well as the amounts of gains and losses
recorded during the year, were not material. The Corporation does not hold or
issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Stock-based compensation--The Corporation measures compensation cost for
stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method of accounting as
prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. The Corporation has adopted
those provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
which require disclosure of the pro forma effects on net earnings and earnings
per share as if compensation cost had been recognized based upon the estimated
fair value at the date of grant for options awarded.
Comprehensive income--Comprehensive income loss for the Corporation consists
primarily of net earnings loss, after-tax foreign currency translation
adjustments, after-tax unrealized gains and losses related to hedging activities
and available-for-sale securities, and the after-tax impact of additional
minimum pension liabilities. Income taxes related to components of other
comprehensive income are generally recorded based on an effective tax rate of 39
percent. At December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the accumulated balances of other
comprehensive income related to foreign currency translation adjustments were
not material and, at December 31, 2001, the accumulated balance related to net
unrealized gains and losses from hedging activities was not material. For the
year ended December 31, 2001, other comprehensive income included a net
unrealized gain of $23 million primarily related to the Corporation
investments in Loral Space & Communications, Ltd. Loral Space and New Skies
Satellites, N.V. New Skies, a reclassification adjustment of $151 million
related to the realization of the loss in value of its investment in Loral Space
in the third quarter of 2001, and an additional minimum pension liability of $33
million related to certain of the Corporation defined benefit pension plans.
Other comprehensive loss in 2000 consisted primarily of a $129 million
unrealized loss related to the decline in value of the Corporation investment
in Loral Space.
New accounting pronouncements--The Corporation adopted SFAS No. 142, Accounting
for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as of January 1, 2002. Among  
Page 57  
other things, the Statement prohibits the amortization of goodwill and sets
forth a new methodology for periodically assessing and, if warranted, recording
impairment of goodwill. The Statement also requires completion of the initial
step of a transitional impairment test within six months of the adoption of SFAS
No. 142 and, if applicable, completion of the final step of the impairment test
by the end of the fiscal year of adoption. In connection with the impairment
provisions of the new rules, the Corporation has completed the initial step of
the goodwill impairment test and has concluded that no adjustment to the balance
of goodwill at the date of adoption is required. In addition, the Corporation
reassessed the estimated remaining useful lives of other intangible assets as
part of its adoption of the Statement. As a result of that review, the estimated
useful life of the intangible asset related to the F-16 fighter aircraft program
has been extended. This change is expected to decrease annual amortization
expense associated with that intangible asset by approximately $30 million on a
pretax basis. If the Statement had been adopted at the beginning of 2001, the
extension of the estimated useful life of that intangible asset and the absence
of goodwill amortization would have increased earnings from continuing
operations before extraordinary item by approximately $240 million $055 per
diluted share.
The Corporation elected to early adopt, effective January 1, 2001, SFAS No.
144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The new
Statement supercedes previous accounting guidance related to impairment of
long-lived assets and provides a single accounting methodology for the disposal
of long-lived assets, and also supercedes previous guidance with respect to
reporting the effects of the disposal of a business. In connection with the
Corporation decision to exit its global telecommunications services business
and divest certain of the related business units see Note 2--Exit From the
Global Telecommunications Services Business, the results of operations and
cash flows of certain businesses identified as held for sale, as well as the
impairment and other charges related to the decision to exit these businesses,
are classified as discontinued operations in the Corporation consolidated
financial statements for all periods presented, and are excluded from business
segment information. Similarly, the assets and liabilities of these businesses
are separately identified in the consolidated financial statements as being held
for sale.
The results of operations and related gains or losses associated with
businesses divested prior to the effective date of the Corporation adoption of
SFAS No. 144, including the divestitures of the Corporation Aerospace
Electronics Systems AES businesses and Lockheed Martin Control Systems in
2000, have not been reclassified to discontinued operations in accordance with
the Statement.
Effective January 1, 1999, the Corporation adopted the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants' Statement of Position SOP No. 98-5,
Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities. This SOP requires that, at the
effective date of adoption, costs of start-up activities previously capitalized
be expensed and reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle, and further requires that such costs subsequent to adoption be
expensed as incurred. The adoption of SOP No. 98-5 resulted in the recognition
of a cumulative effect adjustment which reduced net earnings for the year ended
December 31, 1999 by $355 million $093 per diluted share. The cumulative
effect adjustment was recorded net of income tax benefits of $227 million, and
was primarily composed of approximately $560 million of costs previously
included in inventories.
Note 2--Exit From the Global Telecommunications Services Business
On December 7, 2001, the Corporation announced that it would exit its
global telecommunications services business as a result of continuing
overcapacity in the telecommunications industry and deteriorating business and
economic conditions in Latin America. In connection with its decision, the
Corporation reassigned certain of the businesses in the Global
Telecommunications segment to other business segments, plans to sell the
remaining operations, has positioned the remaining investments for monetization,
and is eliminating the administrative infrastructure supporting such businesses
and investments. Separately, the Corporation decided not to provide further
funding to Astrolink International, LLC Astrolink and, due primarily to
Astrolink inability to obtain additional funding from other sources, wrote off
its investment in Astrolink see Note 9--Investments for a discussion of the
write-off of  
Page 58  
Astrolink. As a result of these actions, the Global Telecommunications segment
will no longer be reported as a separate business segment.
The Corporation recognized nonrecurring and unusual charges, net of state
income tax benefits, totaling approximately $20 billion in the fourth quarter
of 2001 related to these actions. The charges decreased net earnings by
approximately $17 billion $398 per diluted share.
The Global Telecommunications segment businesses retained by the
Corporation have been realigned as follows o The Systems & Technology line of business and the COMSAT General
telecommunications business unit has been realigned within the Space Systems
segment.
o Enterprise Solutions-U.S., a commercial information technology
business, has been realigned within the Technology Services segment.
The Global Telecommunications segment equity investments positioned for
monetization include Intelsat, Ltd. Intelsat, Inmarsat Ventures plc
Inmarsat, New Skies, ACeS International, Ltd. ACeS, Americom Asia-Pacific,
LLC and Astrolink. These investments are now reported as part of the Corporate
and Other segment.
Following is a discussion which describes the components of the $20
billion in charges based on their classification in the Corporation
consolidated financial statements.
Discontinued Operations
The $20 billion in charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 included
charges, net of state income tax benefits, of approximately $14 billion related
to certain global telecommunications services businesses held for sale and exit
costs associated with elimination of the administrative infrastructure
supporting the global telecommunications businesses and investments. These
charges, which reduced net earnings for 2001 by $13 billion $309 per diluted
share, are included in discontinued operations in the Corporation statement
of operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144. In addition, the results of
operations of these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations
in the Corporation consolidated statements of operations for all periods
presented, and excluded from business segment information. Similarly, the assets
and liabilities of these businesses have been separately identified in the
consolidated balance sheet as being held for sale. The Corporation expects to
complete the sale of these businesses by the end of 2002. Depreciation and
amortization expense are no longer being recorded with respect to the assets of
these businesses in accordance with SFAS No. 144. These businesses are recorded
at estimated fair value less cost to sell at December 31, 2001. Changes in the
estimated fair value will be recorded in future periods as determined. The
businesses held for sale are as follows o Satellite Services businesses--includes COMSAT Mobile Communications, COMSAT
World Systems and Lockheed Martin Intersputnik. In the first quarter of 2002,
the Corporation completed the sale of COMSAT Mobile Communications. The
transaction is not expected to have a material impact on the
Corporation consolidated results of operations.
o COMSAT-International formerly Enterprise 
telecommunications network services in Latin America, primarily Argentina
and Brazil.
Of the $14 billion of charges included in discontinued operations,
approximately $12 billion related to impairment of goodwill recorded in the
Global Telecommunications segment. The goodwill was recorded in connection with
the Corporation acquisition of COMSAT as discussed in Note 3--Acquisitions
and Other Divestiture Activities. The write-down of the goodwill was based on
the relationship of its carrying value to the Corporation estimated realizable
value. Approximately $170 million of the $14 billion related to impairment of
certain long-lived assets employed by foreign businesses held for sale,
primarily COMSAT-International. The remainder of the charges included in
discontinued operations are related to costs associated with infrastructure
reductions, including severance and facilities.
In addition, the Corporation completed the sale of Lockheed Martin IMS
Corporation IMS, a wholly-owned subsidiary, for $825 million in cash on August
24, 2001. The transaction resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $476
million and increased net earnings by $309 million $071 per diluted share.
The results of IMS' operations for all periods presented, as well as the gain on
the sale, have been reclassified to discontinued operations in accordance with
SFAS No. 144. IMS' assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2000 have been
reclassified as held for sale.

Other Charges Related to Global Telecommunications
The charges recorded in the fourth quarter also included nonrecurring and
unusual charges, net of state income tax benefits, of approximately $132 million
related to commitments to and impairment in the values of investments in
satellite joint ventures, primarily ACeS and Americom Asia-Pacific, LLC. In
addition, approximately $43 million was recorded for severance and facilities
costs, and impairment of certain fixed assets, associated with the business
units that have been realigned. On a combined basis, these nonrecurring and
unusual charges reduced net earnings for 2001 by $117 million $027 per diluted
share.
Note 3--Acquisitions and Other Divestiture Activities
Business Combination with COMSAT Corporation
In September 1998, the Corporation and COMSAT Corporation COMSAT
announced that they had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to combine
the companies in a two-phase transaction. The Corporation completed a cash
tender offer for 49 percent of the outstanding stock of COMSAT on September 18,
1999. The total value of this phase of the transaction was $12 billion. The
Corporation accounted for its 49 percent investment in COMSAT under the equity
method of accounting.
On August 3, 2000, the second phase of the transaction was completed. The
total amount recorded related to this phase of the transaction was approximately
$13 billion based on the Corporation issuance of approximately 275 million
shares of its common stock at a price of $49 per share. This price per share
represents the average of the price of Lockheed Martin common stock a few days
before and after the announcement of the transaction in September 1998.
The total purchase price for COMSAT, including transaction costs and
amounts related to Lockheed Martin assumption of COMSAT stock options, was
approximately $26 billion, net of $76 million in cash balances acquired. The
COMSAT transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting,
under which the purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on their fair values. Included in these allocations were
adjustments totaling approximately $21 billion to record investments in equity
securities at fair value and goodwill.
The Corporation consolidated the operations of COMSAT with the results of
operations of Lockheed Martin Global Telecommunications, Inc. LMGT, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, from August 1, 2000.
Divestiture Activities
In November 2000, the Corporation sold its Aerospace Electronics Systems
AES businesses for $167 billion in cash the AES Transaction. The
Corporation recorded a nonrecurring and unusual loss of $598 million related to
the AES Transaction which is included in other income and expenses. The loss
reduced net earnings for 2000 by $878 million $218 per diluted share.
In September 2000, the Corporation sold Lockheed Martin Control Systems
Control Systems for $510 million in cash. This transaction resulted in the
recognition of a nonrecurring and unusual gain, net of state income taxes, of
$302 million which is reflected in other income and expenses. The gain increased
net earnings for 2000 by $180 million $045 per diluted share.  
Page 60  
Also in September 2000, the Corporation sold approximately one-third of its
interest in Inmarsat for $164 million. The investment in Inmarsat was acquired
as part of the merger with COMSAT. As a result of the transaction, the
Corporation interest in Inmarsat was reduced from approximately 22% to 14%.
The sale of shares in Inmarsat did not impact the Corporation results of
operations for 2000.
In March 1997, the Corporation repositioned 10 of its non-core business
units as a new independent company, L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. L-3. In
1999, the Corporation sold its remaining interest in L-3 in two separate
transactions. On a combined basis, these transactions resulted in a nonrecurring
and unusual gain, net of state income taxes, of $155 million which increased net
earnings by $101 million $026 per diluted share.
In September 1999, the Corporation sold its interest in Airport Group
International Holdings, LLC which resulted in a nonrecurring and unusual gain,
net of state income taxes, of $33 million in other income and expenses. In
October 1999, the Corporation exited its commercial 3D graphics business through
consummation of a series of transactions which resulted in the sale of its
interest in Real 3D, Inc., a majority-owned subsidiary, and a nonrecurring and
unusual gain, net of state income taxes, of $33 million in other income and
expenses. On a combined basis, these transactions increased net earnings by $43
million $011 per diluted share.
Note 4--Restructuring and Other Charges
In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Corporation recorded a nonrecurring and
unusual pretax charge, net of state income tax benefits, of $233 million related
to actions surrounding the decision to fund a timely non-bankruptcy shutdown of
the business of CalComp Technology, Inc. CalComp, a majority-owned subsidiary.
The financial impacts of actions taken in 1999 to shut down the business were
less than anticipated in the Corporation plans and estimates and, in the
fourth quarter of 1999, the Corporation reversed approximately 10 percent of the
original charge recorded in 1998. Based on management assessment of the
remaining actions to be taken as of December 31, 2000 to complete initiatives
contemplated in the Corporation original plans and estimates, the Corporation
reversed approximately $33 million of the original charge, which increased net
earnings for 2000 by $21 million $005 per diluted share. As of December 31,
2001, the Corporation had substantially completed the shutdown of CalComp
operations and related initiatives.
Under existing U.S. Government regulations, certain costs incurred for
consolidation actions that can be demonstrated to result in savings in excess of
the cost to implement can be deferred and amortized for government contracting
purposes and included as allowable costs in future pricing of the Corporation
products and services. Included in the consolidated balance sheet at December
31, 2001 is approximately $260 million of deferred costs related to various
consolidation actions.
Note 5--Earnings Per Share
Basic and diluted per share results for all periods presented were computed
based on the net earnings or loss for the respective periods. The weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period was used in the
calculation of basic earnings loss per share. In accordance with SFAS No. 128,
Earnings Per Share, the weighted average number of common shares used in the
calculation of diluted per share amounts is adjusted for the dilutive effects of
stock options based on the treasury stock method only if an entity records
earnings from continuing operations i.e., before discontinued operations,
extraordinary items and cumulative effects of changes in accounting, as such
adjustments would otherwise be anti-dilutive to earnings per share from
continuing operations.

Satellite ventures includes the Corporation investments in Space Imaging,
LLC, Astrolink, Americom Asia-Pacific and ACeS. The carrying values of the
Corporation investments in Loral Space and New Skies are marked-to-market.
The carrying value of the Corporation 24 percent investment in Intelsat,
which was acquired in connection with the merger with COMSAT, exceeded the
Corporation share of Intelsat net assets by approximately $700 million as a
result of purchase accounting adjustments to record the investment at fair
value. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, this amount was being amortized
ratably over 30 years; however, as discussed in Note 1--Significant Accounting
Policies, this amount will no longer be amortized beginning January 1, 2002.
The Corporation completed funding of its $400 million investment commitment
to Astrolink, a joint venture in which the Corporation holds a 31 percent
interest, in 2001. Astrolink had received a total of $13 billion in equity
funding from its partners which, in addition to the Corporation, include Liberty
Media, TRW and Telespazio. The Astrolink business plan contemplated obtaining
further funding from a combination of strategic equity, public equity and debt
funding sources.  
Page 63  
In October 2001, the Corporation made the decision and so advised Astrolink
that it did not plan to make any additional investment in the joint venture. In
addition to its equity investment, Lockheed Martin Space Systems segment had
contracts with Astrolink to manufacture four satellites and provide related
launch services, and LMGT had contracts to perform system development and other
services. Those contracts were terminated due to Astrolink funding
considerations. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Corporation recognized a
nonrecurring and unusual charge, net of state income tax benefits, of
approximately $367 million in other income and expenses which reflects the other
than temporary decline in value of its investment in Astrolink based on the
above circumstances. In addition, approximately $20 million of charges were
recorded in cost of sales for certain other costs related to Astrolink. On a
combined basis, these charges reduced net earnings for the year ended December
31, 2001 by approximately $267 million $062 per diluted share.
In the third quarter of 2001, the Corporation recorded a nonrecurring and
unusual charge, net of state income tax benefits, of $361 million in other
income and expenses related to its investment in Loral Space. The charge, which
was recorded due to a decline in the value of the Corporation investment,
reduced net earnings by $235 million $054 per diluted share. The decline in
value of the investment was assessed to be other than temporary due to the
downward trend in the market price of Loral Space stock and the potential impact
of underlying market and industry conditions on Loral Space ability to execute
its current business plans.
In the first quarter of 2001, the Corporation recorded a nonrecurring and
unusual charge, net of state income tax benefits, of $100 million in other
income and expenses related to impairment of its investment in Americom
Asia-Pacific, LLC, a joint venture in which the Corporation holds a 50 percent
interest. The charge reduced net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2001
by $65 million $015 per diluted share. The satellite operated by Americom
Asia-Pacific, which serves Southeast Asia, was placed in commercial operation
late in the fourth quarter of 2000. The decline in value of the investment was
assessed to be other than temporary as a result of lower transponder pricing,
lower than expected demand and overall market conditions. The remaining value of
the investment was written off in the fourth quarter of 2001 in connection with
the Corporation decision to exit the global telecommunications services
business.
In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Corporation recorded a nonrecurring and
unusual charge, net of state income tax benefits, of $117 million related to
impairment of its investment in ACeS due to an other than temporary decline in
the value of the investment. ACeS is a joint venture in which the Corporation
holds a 33 percent interest at December 31, 2001. ACeS operates the Asian
Cellular Satellite System, a geostationary mobile satellite system serving
Southeast Asia which was placed in commercial operation in the fourth quarter of
2000. The spacecraft experienced an anomaly that may reduce the overall capacity
of the system by about 30 to 35 percent. The decline in the value of the
investment was assessed to be other than temporary as a result of the reduced
business prospects due to this anomaly as well as overall market conditions. The
adjustment reduced net earnings by $77 million $019 per share.

In September 2001, the Corporation redeemed approximately $117 million of
7% debentures $175 million at face value due in 2011 which were originally
sold at approximately 54 percent of their principal amount. The debentures were
redeemed at face value, resulting in an extraordinary loss on early
extinguishment of debt, net of $22 million in income tax benefits, of $36
million $008 per diluted share.  
Page 64  
In July 2001, COMSAT, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation,
redeemed $200 million in principal amount of the 8125% Cumulative Monthly
Income Preferred Securities MIPS previously issued by a wholly-owned
subsidiary of COMSAT. The MIPS were redeemed at par value of $25 per share plus
accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date. The redemption did not
result in an extraordinary gain or loss on the early extinguishment of debt.
Also in 2001, the Corporation repaid approximately $126 billion of notes
outstanding which had been issued to a wholly-owned subsidiary of General
Electric Company. The notes would have been due November 17, 2002. The early
repayment of the notes did not result in an extraordinary gain or loss on the
early extinguishment of debt.
In December 2000, the Corporation purchased approximately $19 billion in
principal amount of debt securities included in tender offers for six issues of
notes and debentures. The repurchase of the debt securities resulted in an
extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt, net of $61 million in income
tax benefits, of $95 million.
In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Corporation entered into interest rate
swaps to swap fixed interest rates on approximately $670 million of its
long-term debt for variable interest rates based on LIBOR. At December 31, 2001,
the fair values of interest rate swap agreements outstanding, as well as the
amounts of gains and losses recorded during the year, were not material.
The registered holders of $300 million of 40 year Debentures issued in 1996
may elect, between March 1 and April 1, 2008, to have their Debentures repaid by
the Corporation on May 1, 2008.
A leveraged employee stock ownership plan ESOP incorporated into the
Corporation salaried savings plan borrowed $500 million through a private
placement of notes in 1989. These notes are being repaid in quarterly
installments over terms ending in 2004. The ESOP note agreement stipulates that,
in the event that the ratings assigned to the Corporation long-term senior
unsecured debt are below investment grade, holders of the notes may require the
Corporation to purchase the notes and pay accrued interest. These notes are
obligations of the ESOP but are guaranteed by the Corporation and included as
debt in the Corporation consolidated balance sheet.
At the end of 2001, the Corporation had in place a $10 billion 1-year
revolving credit facility and a $15 billion 5-year revolving credit facility
the Credit Facilities. Borrowings under the Credit Facilities would be
unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at the Corporation option, on the
Eurodollar rate or a bank Base Rate as defined. Each bank obligation to make
loans under the Credit Facilities is subject to, among other things, compliance
by the Corporation with various representations, warranties and covenants,
including, but not limited to, covenants limiting the ability of the Corporation
and certain of its subsidiaries to encumber their assets and a covenant not to
exceed a maximum leverage ratio. No borrowings were outstanding under the Credit
Facilities at December 31, 2001.
The Corporation long-term debt maturities for the five years following
December 31, 2001 are: $89 million in 2002; $780 million in 2003; $142 million
in 2004; $15 million in 2005; $780 million in 2006; and $5,705 million
thereafter.
Certain of the Corporation other financing agreements contain restrictive
covenants relating to debt, limitations on encumbrances and sale and lease-back
transactions, and provisions which relate to certain changes in control.
The estimated fair values of the Corporation long-term debt instruments
at December 31, 2001, aggregated approximately $82 billion, compared with a
carrying amount of approximately $75 billion. The fair values were estimated
based on quoted market prices for those instruments publicly traded. For
privately placed debt, the fair values were estimated based on the quoted market
prices for similar issues, or on current rates offered to the Corporation for
debt with similar remaining maturities. Unless otherwise indicated elsewhere in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the carrying values of the
Corporation other financial instruments approximate their fair values.
In June 2000, the Corporation was notified that Globalstar, L.P.
Globalstar failed to repay borrowings of $250 million under a revolving credit
agreement on which Lockheed Martin was a partial guarantor. In connection with
its contractual obligation under the guarantee, on June 30, 2000, the
Corporation paid $207 million to the lending institutions from which Globalstar
had borrowed, which included applicable interest and fees. On that same date,
Loral Space, under a separate indemnification agreement between the Corporation
and Loral Space, paid Lockheed Martin $57 million. The Corporation is entitled
to repayment by Globalstar of the remaining $150 million paid under the
guarantee, but has not as yet reached agreement with respect to the form and
timing of such repayment. In light of the uncertainty of the situation regarding
the  
Page 65  
amounts due from Globalstar, the Corporation recorded a nonrecurring and unusual
charge in the second quarter of 2000, net of state income tax benefits, of
approximately $141 million in other income and expenses. The charge reduced net
earnings for 2000 by $91 million $023 per diluted share. On February 15,
2002, Globalstar and certain of its affiliates filed a voluntary petition under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
Interest payments were $707 million in 2001, $947 million in 2000 and $790
million in 1999.

Note 13--Stockholders' Equity and Related Items
Capital stock--At December 31, 2001, the authorized capital of the Corporation
was composed of 15 billion shares of common stock approximately 441 million
shares issued, 50 million shares of series preferred stock no shares issued,
and 20 million shares of Series A preferred stock no shares outstanding.
Stock option and award plans--In March 1995, the stockholders approved the
Lockheed Martin 1995 Omnibus Performance Award Plan the Omnibus Plan. Under
the Omnibus Plan, employees of the Corporation may be granted stock-based
incentive awards, including options to purchase common stock, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock or other stock-based incentive awards. Employees may
also be granted cash-based incentive awards, such as performance units. These
awards may be granted either individually or in combination with other awards.
The Omnibus Plan requires that options to purchase common stock have an exercise
price of not less than 100 percent of the market value of the underlying stock
on the date of grant. The Omnibus Plan does not impose any minimum vesting
periods on options or other awards. The maximum term of an option or any other
award is 10 years. The Omnibus Plan allows the Corporation to provide for
financing of purchases of its common stock, subject to certain conditions, by
interest-bearing notes payable to the Corporation.
In 2001, 2000 and 1999, a total of 325,000 shares of restricted common
stock 25,000, 125,000 and 175,000 shares, respectively were awarded under the
Omnibus Plan to certain senior executives of the Corporation. The shares were
recorded based on the market value of the Corporation common stock on the date
of the award. The award requires the recipients to pay the $1 par value of each
share of stock and provides for payment to be made in cash or in the form of a
recourse note to the Corporation. Recipients are entitled to receive cash
dividends and to vote their respective shares, but are prohibited from selling
or transferring shares prior to vesting. The restricted shares generally vest
over four- to five-year periods from the grant date. The impact of these awards
was not material to stockholders' equity or compensation expense in 2001, 2000
or 1999.
In April 1999, the stockholders approved the Lockheed Martin Directors
Equity Plan the Directors Plan. Approximately 50 percent of each director
annual compensation is awarded under the Directors Plan. Directors of the
Corporation may elect to receive such compensation in the form of stock units
which track investment return to changes in value of the Corporation common
stock with dividends reinvested, options to purchase common stock of the
Corporation, or a combination of the two. The Directors Plan requires that
options to purchase common stock have an exercise price of not less than 100
percent of the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Except
in certain circumstances, options and stock units issued under the Directors
Plan vest on the first anniversary of the grant. The maximum term of an option
is 10 years.
The Omnibus Plan and the Directors Plan, as well as the number of shares of
Lockheed Martin common stock authorized for issuance under these plans, have
been approved by the stockholders of the Corporation. At December 31, 2001, the
number of shares of Lockheed Martin common stock reserved for issuance under
these plans totaled 53 million.

-    All stock options granted in 2001, 2000 and 1999 under the Omnibus Plan
have 10-year terms and generally vest over a two-year service period. Exercise
prices of options awarded in those years were equal to the market price of the
stock on the date of grant. Pro forma information regarding net earnings and
earnings per share as required by SFAS No. 123 has been prepared as if the
Corporation had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value
method. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively: risk-free interest rates of
495 percent, 661 percent and 464 percent; dividend yields of 06 percent, 08
percent and 24 percent; volatility factors related to the expected market price
of the Corporation common stock of 366, 342 and 247; and a weighted average
expected option life of five years. The weighted average fair value of each
option granted during 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $1332, $762 and $853,
respectively.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the options' estimated fair values
are amortized to expense over the options' vesting periods. The Corporation

-  Note 14--Post-Retirement Benefit Plans
Defined contribution plans--The Corporation maintains a number of defined
contribution plans which cover substantially all employees, the most significant
of which are the 401k plans for salaried employees and hourly employees. Under
the provisions of these 401k plans, employees' eligible contributions are
matched by the Corporation at established rates. The Corporation matching
obligations were $226 million in 2001, $221 million in 2000 and $222 million in
1999.
The Lockheed Martin Corporation Salaried Savings Plan includes an ESOP
which purchased 348 million shares of the Corporation common stock with the
proceeds from a $500 million note issue which is guaranteed by the Corporation.
The Corporation match consisted of shares of its common stock, which was
partially fulfilled with stock released from the ESOP at approximately 24
million shares per year based upon the debt repayment schedule through the year
2004, with the remainder being fulfilled through purchases of common stock from
terminating participants or in the open market, or through newly issued shares
from the Corporation. Interest incurred on the ESOP debt totaled $13 million 17 million and $20 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Dividends
received by the ESOP with respect to unallocated shares held are used for debt
service. The ESOP held approximately 478 million issued shares of the
Corporation common stock at December 31, 2001, of which approximately 420
million were allocated and 58 million were unallocated. The fair value of the  
Page 68  unallocated ESOP shares at December 31, 2001 was approximately
$270 million. Unallocated common shares held by the ESOP are considered
outstanding for voting and other Corporate purposes, but excluded from weighted
average outstanding shares in calculating earnings per share. For 2001, 2000 and
1999, the weighted average unallocated ESOP shares excluded in calculating
earnings per share totaled approximately 67 million, 90 million and 113
million common shares, respectively.
Certain plans for hourly employees include non-leveraged ESOPs. The
Corporation match to these plans was made through cash contributions to the
ESOP trusts which were used, in part, to purchase common stock from terminating
participants and in the open market for allocation to participant accounts.
These ESOP trusts held approximately 38 million issued and outstanding shares
of common stock at December 31, 2001.
Dividends paid to the salaried and hourly ESOP trusts on the allocated
shares are paid annually by the ESOP trusts to the participants based upon the
number of shares allocated to each participant.
Defined benefit pension plans, and retiree medical and life insurance
plans--Most employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans, and certain
health care and life insurance benefits are provided to eligible retirees by the
Corporation. The Corporation has made contributions to trusts including
Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association trusts and 401h accounts, the
assets of which will be used to pay expenses of certain retiree medical plans
established to pay future benefits to eligible retirees and dependents. Benefit
obligations as of the end of each year reflect assumptions in effect as of those
dates. Net pension and net retiree medical costs for 2001, 2000 and 1999 were
based on assumptions in effect at the end of the respective preceding years.

obligation were 82 percent in 2001 and 78 percent in 2000, and were assumed to
ultimately decrease to 45 percent by the year 2012. An increase or decrease of
one percentage point in the assumed medical trend rates would result in a change
in the benefit obligation of approximately 43 percent and 38 percent,
respectively, at December 31, 2001, and a change in the 2001 post-retirement
service cost plus interest cost of approximately 47 percent and 41 percent,
respectively. The medical trend rate for 2002 is 91 percent.
The Corporation sponsors nonqualified defined benefit plans to provide
benefits in excess of qualified plan limits. The expense associated with these
plans totaled $47 million in 2001, $43 million in 2000 and $40 million in 1999.
Note 15--Leases
Total rental expense under operating leases was $223 million, $232 million
and $260 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Future minimum lease commitments at December 31, 2001 for all operating
leases that have a remaining term of more than one year were approximately $855
million $139 million in 2002, $129 million in 2003, $125 million in 2004, $114
million in 2005, $106 million in 2006 and $242 million in later years. Certain
major plant facilities and equipment are furnished by the U.S. Government under
short-term or cancelable arrangements.
Note 16--Commitments and Contingencies
The Corporation or its subsidiaries are parties to or have property subject
to litigation and other proceedings, including matters arising under provisions
relating to the protection of the environment. In the opinion of management and
in-house counsel, the probability is remote that the outcome of these matters
will have a material adverse effect on the Corporation consolidated results of
operations or financial position. These matters include the following items   Environmental matters--The Corporation is responding to three
administrative orders issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control
Board the Regional Board in connection with the Corporation former Lockheed
Propulsion Company facilities in Redlands, California. Under the orders, the
Corporation is investigating the impact and potential remediation of regional
groundwater contamination by perchlorates and chlorinated solvents. The Regional
Board has approved the Corporation plan to maintain public water supplies with
respect to chlorinated solvents during this investigation, and the Corporation
continues to negotiate with local water purveyors to implement this plan, as
well as to address water supply concerns relative to perchlorate contamination.
The Corporation estimates that expenditures required to implement work currently
approved will be approximately $85 million. The Corporation is also coordinating
with the U.S. Air Force, which is working with the aerospace and defense
industry to conduct preliminary studies of the potential health effects of
perchlorate exposure in connection with several sites across the country,
including the Redlands site. The results of these studies are intended to assist
state and federal regulators in setting appropriate action levels for
perchlorates  
Page 70  in groundwater, and therefore are intended to assist the Corporation in
determining its ultimate clean-up obligation, if any, with respect to
perchlorates. In January 2002, the State of California reduced its provisional
standard for perchlorate concentration in water from 18 parts per billion ppb
to four ppb. This provisional standard may be used by the State in providing
guidelines to water purveyors; however, until such time as it is formally
adopted after a public notice and comment period, it is not a legally
enforceable standard. If formally adopted as a regulation, this change would
lead to increased clean-up costs for the Corporation related to the Redlands
site.
Since 1990, the Corporation has been responding to various consent decrees
and orders relating to soil and regional groundwater contamination in the San
Fernando Valley associated with the Corporation former operations in Burbank,
California. Among other things, these consent decrees and orders obligate the
Corporation to construct and fund the operations of soil and groundwater
treatment facilities in Burbank and Glendale, California through 2018 and 2012,
respectively; however, responsibility for the long-term operation of these
facilities was assumed by the respective localities in 2001. The Corporation has
been successful in limiting its financial responsibility for these activities to
date to its pro rata share as a result of litigation and settlements with other
potentially responsible parties. In addition, under an agreement reached with
the U.S. Government in 2000, the Corporation will continue to be reimbursed in
an amount equal to approximately 50 percent of future expenditures for certain
remediation activities by the U.S. Government in its capacity as a potentially
responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act CERCLA. The Corporation estimates that total expenditures
required over the remaining terms of the consent decrees and orders described
above, net of the effects of the agreement, will be approximately $50 million.
The Corporation is involved in proceedings and potential proceedings
relating to environmental matters at other facilities, including disposal of
hazardous wastes and soil and water contamination. The extent of the
Corporation financial exposure cannot in all cases be reasonably estimated at
this time. In addition to the amounts with respect to the Redlands and Burbank
properties and the city of Glendale described above, a liability of
approximately $165 million for the other properties including current operating
facilities and certain facilities operated in prior years in which an estimate
of financial exposure can be determined has been recorded.
Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government in 1990 and 2000, the
Burbank groundwater treatment and soil remediation expenditures referenced above
are being allocated to the Corporation operations as general and
administrative costs and, under existing government regulations, these and other
environmental expenditures related to U.S. Government business, after deducting
any recoveries from insurance or other potentially responsible parties, are
allowable in establishing the prices of the Corporation products and services.
As a result, a substantial portion of the expenditures are being reflected in
the Corporation sales and cost of sales pursuant to U.S. Government agreement
or regulation.
The Corporation has recorded an asset for the portion of environmental
costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of the Corporation
products and services for U.S. Government business. The portion that is expected
to be allocated to commercial business has been reflected in cost of sales. The
recorded amounts do not reflect the possible future recoveries of portions of
the environmental costs through insurance policy coverage or from other
potentially responsible parties, which the Corporation is pursuing as required
by agreement and U.S. Government regulation. Any such recoveries, when received,
would reduce the allocated amounts to be included in the Corporation U.S.
Government sales and cost of sales.
Waste remediation contract--In 1994, the Corporation was awarded a $180 million
fixed-price contract by the U.S. Department of Energy DoE for remediation of
waste found in Pit 9, located on the Idaho National Engineering and
Environmental Laboratory reservation. The Corporation incurred significant
unanticipated costs and scheduling issues due to complex technical and
contractual matters, which it sought to remedy through submission of a request
for equitable adjustment. To date, the Corporation has been unsuccessful in
reaching any agreements with the DoE on cost recovery or other contract
restructuring matters. In 1998, the management contractor for the project, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, at the DoE direction, terminated
the Pit 9 contract for default. As a result, the Corporation filed a lawsuit
challenging and seeking to overturn the default termination and recover its
costs. Also in  
Page 71  1998, the management contractor, also at the DoE direction, filed suit against
the Corporation seeking, among other things, recovery of approximately $54
million previously paid to the Corporation under the Pit 9 contract. The
Corporation is defending this action in which discovery has been pending since
August 1999. In January 2001, in the Court of Federal Claims, the DoE filed a
motion for summary judgment seeking to dismiss the Corporation complaint on
jurisdictional grounds. On October 16, 2001, the Court of Federal Claims granted
the DoE motion to dismiss, finding that there was no privity of contract
between the Corporation and the United States sufficient to provide the Court
with the jurisdiction over the dispute. The Corporation recently appealed the
Court decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
The Corporation continues to seek resolution of the Pit 9 dispute through
non-litigation means.
Letters of credit and other matters--The Corporation has entered into standby
letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions
primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts.
At December 31, 2001, the Corporation had contingent liabilities on outstanding
letters of credit, guarantees, and other arrangements aggregating approximately
$900 million.
Note 17--Information on Industry Segments and Major Customers
The Corporation operates in four principal business segments. The four
segments include Systems Integration, Space Systems, Aeronautics and Technology
Services. All other activities of the Corporation fall within the Corporate and
Other segment.
Transactions between segments are generally negotiated and accounted for
under terms and conditions that are similar to other government and commercial
contracts; however, these intercompany transactions are eliminated in
consolidation. Other accounting policies of the business segments are the same
as those described in Note 1--Significant Accounting Policies.
As mentioned previously, Lockheed Martin announced in December 2001 its
decision to exit its global telecommunications services business. In connection
with this decision, the Global Telecommunications segment will no longer be
presented as a separate operating segment. Certain of the businesses previously
included in the segment have been classified as discontinued operations;
therefore, financial information related to such businesses has been excluded
from the segment information presented below for all periods. The remaining
businesses and investments previously included in the Global Telecommunications
segment have been realigned with other business segments as discussed more fully
in Note 2--Exit From the Global Telecommunications Services Business.
The following segment descriptions and financial data have been adjusted to
reflect elimination of the Corporation Global Telecommunications segment noted
above for the periods presented. Following is a brief description of the
activities of each business segment Systems Integration--Engaged in the design, development, integration and

Diluted earnings loss per share, differ from amounts previously
reported on Forms 10-Q for the respective periods due to the
reclassification of the results of operations of certain businesses held
for sale to discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of
operations.
b The sum of the diluted earnings loss per share amounts for the four
quarters of 2001 do not equal the related amount included in the
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001
due to the exclusion of the impact of dilutive stock options from the third
quarter calculation of per share amounts.
c Net earnings for the first quarter of 2001 included the following
nonrecurring and unusual items: a gain on the sale of surplus real estate
which increased net earnings by $72 million $017 per diluted share; and
an impairment charge related to the Corporation investment in Americom
Asia-Pacific which reduced net earnings by $65 million $015 per diluted
share.
d Net earnings for the third quarter of 2001 included the following
nonrecurring and unusual items: an impairment charge related to the
Corporation investment in Loral Space which reduced net earnings by $235
million $054 per diluted share; an extraordinary loss on the early
extinguishment of debt which reduced net earnings by $36 million $008 per
diluted share; and divestiture and other portfolio shaping activities
which, on a combined basis, decreased net earnings by $3 million. Net
earnings also includes a gain on the sale of IMS which is included in
discontinued operations and which increased net earnings by $309 million
$071 per diluted share.
e The net loss for the fourth quarter of 2001 included the following
nonrecurring and unusual items: a write-down of the Corporation
investment in Astrolink and related costs which increased the net loss by
$267 million $062 per diluted share; and charges related to the
Corporation exit from its global telecommunications services business
which increased the net loss by $117 million $027 per diluted share. The
net loss also includes other nonrecurring and unusual charges related to
impairment of goodwill and other assets, and other costs associated with
certain global telecommunications businesses held for sale. These charges
are recorded in discontinued operations and increased the net loss by $13
billion $ 309 per diluted share.  
Page 74  f The sum of the diluted earnings loss per share amounts for the four
quarters of 2000 do not equal the related amounts included in the
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000
due to the impact of the issuance of 275 million shares of the
Corporation common stock to consummate the merger with COMSAT. In
addition, the quarterly earnings per share impact of individual items
discussed in notes g through j below may not equal the earnings per
share impact of such items for the year ended December 31, 2000 as
disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report due to the impact of the issuance
of shares to consummate the merger with COMSAT.
g Net earnings for the first quarter of 2000 included gains from sales of
surplus real estate and losses from portfolio shaping activities. On a
combined basis, these nonrecurring and unusual items increased net earnings
for the first quarter by $6 million $002 per diluted share.
h Net earnings for the second quarter of 2000 included the following
nonrecurring and unusual items: a charge related to the Corporation
guarantee of certain indebtedness of Globalstar which reduced net earnings
for the quarter by $91 million $023 per diluted share; a favorable
adjustment of $21 million $005 per diluted share related to the reversal
of a portion of the previously recorded charge for the shutdown of CalComp.
i Net loss for the third quarter of 2000 included the following nonrecurring
and unusual items: an impairment loss related to the Corporation decision
to sell its AES businesses which reduced net earnings by $980 million
$242 per diluted share; a gain from the Corporation sale of its
Control Systems business which increased net earnings by $180 million
$044 per diluted share; and a net loss of $19 million $004 per diluted
share related to portfolio shaping activities and sales of surplus real
estate.
j Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2000 included the following
nonrecurring and unusual items: an adjustment to reduce the impairment loss
recorded related to the sale of the AES businesses which increased net
earnings by $102 million $024 per diluted share; an impairment charge
related to the Corporation investment in ACeS which reduced net earnings
by $77 million $018 per diluted share; an extraordinary loss on the
early extinguishment of debt which reduced net earnings by $95 million
$023 per diluted share and portfolio shaping activities and sales of
surplus real estate which, on a combined basis, increased net earnings by
$2 million.
