results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2003, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these

Pro Forma Financial Information
Unaudited The following unaudited condensed consolidated
pro forma results for the year ended December31, 2001, has
been prepared as if the Merger had occurred on January1,

The pro forma information includes adjustments
for additional revenue based on the fair market value of certain
drilling contracts acquired, additional depreciation based on
the fair market value of drilling rigs and other property and
equipment acquired and related adjustments for income taxes,
reflecting the incremental benefit attributable to the effect of
the Companys tax structure on the earnings of the combined
companies.   
Restructuring Costs In connection with the Merger, the Company
implemented a restructuring program that included the
consolidation of SantaFe Internationals
administrative office in Dallas, Texas, Global Marines
administrative office in Lafayette, Louisiana, and Global
Marines administrative office in Houston, Texas, into a
single administrative office in Houston, the consolidation of
SantaFe Internationals and Global Marines
North Sea administrative offices in Aberdeen, Scotland, and the
separation of 169 employees from the Company. The employee
functions affected were primarily corporate support in nature
and included accounting, information technology, and employee
benefits, among others. Approximately 60% of the affected
positions were located in Dallas, 23% were located in Houston
and Lafayette, and the remaining 17% were located in Aberdeen.
All of the activities related to this restructuring program were
substantially complete as of December31, 2003. Estimated restructuring costs associated with
Global Marine were recorded as a pretax charge in the fourth
quarter of 2001. Changes in estimated costs, consisting mainly
of refinements of cost estimates, including the estimate related
to the closure of Global Marines office discussed below,
and payments related 61 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND

Estimated costs related to the closure of Global
Marine Inc.s former Houston, Texas, office were originally
based on the assumption that this office space would be
subleased to a third party. Based on current Houston commercial
real estate market conditions, the Company now believes it is
probable that it will not be able to sublease this office space
before the end of the lease term. As a result, the Company has
now accrued the entire liability under the lease. Estimated costs associated with SantaFe
Internationals employee severance and closure of its
Dallas and Aberdeen offices were recognized as a liability
assumed in the purchase business combination and included in the
cost of acquisition in accordance with the provisions of
SFASNo141, Business 62 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Combinations. Changes in estimated costs,
consisting primarily of costs associated with employee
terminations and further employee relocation costs, and payments

In addition to the amounts in the above table,
SantaFe International paid $100million in 2001 at
the time of the merger to SFIC Holdings in consideration for
SFIC Holdings consent to the Merger. This consent was
required pursuant to an intercompany agreement with Kuwait
Petroleum Corporation and SFIC Holdings that required the
consent of SFIC Holdings to, among other things, significant
corporate actions by SantaFe International, including the
issuance of equity securities, sale of significant assets or a
change in the corporate domicile of SantaFe International
or any of its subsidiaries see Note14. As of December31, 2003, the Companys
remaining liability related to its merger-related restructuring
activities totaled $169million, consisting of the
following: $132million related to office closures and
consolidation of facilities, which will be relieved over the
remaining terms of the various office leases ranging up to
41/2 years; $17million related to employee
separation costs, which will be paid out pursuant to the terms
of various severance agreements, over terms ranging up to three
years from the date of separation; and $20million related
to special retirement termination costs, which will be satisfied
pursuant to the payment terms of the retirement plans affected.   
Dividends Holders of GlobalSantaFe Ordinary Shares are
entitled to participate in the payment of dividends in
proportion to their holdings. Under Cayman Islands law, the
Company may pay dividends or make other distributions to the
Companys shareholders, in such amounts as the Board of
Directors deems appropriate from the profits of the Company or
out of the Companys share premium account equivalent to
additional paid-in capital if the Company thereafter has the
ability to pay its debts as they come due. Cash dividends, if
any, will be declared and paid in U.S.dollars. The Company
declared cash dividends of $117million that were unpaid
as of December31, 2003.   
Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial
statements and related footnotes are presented in
U.S.dollars and in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current presentation. 63 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Note2
Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies   
Principles of Consolidation The Company consolidates all of its
majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures over which the
Company exercises control through the joint venture agreement or
related operating and financing agreements. The Company accounts
for its interest in other joint ventures using the equity
method. All material intercompany accounts and transactions are
eliminated in consolidation.   
Cash Equivalents and Marketable
Securities Cash equivalents include highly liquid debt
instruments with remaining maturities of three months or less at
the time of purchase. The Companys marketable securities,
consisting of debt securities with maturities of less than
12months, are classified as held-to-maturity. The carrying
value of these securities approximates market value due to the
short-term nature of these securities. In addition, the Company
holds securities in connection with certain nonqualified pension
plans see Note3, which are classified as
available-for-sale. These investments are reported at fair
value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings
and reported as a separate component of shareholders
equity.   
Properties and Depreciation Rigs and Drilling
Equipment. Capitalized costs of rigs
and drilling equipment include all costs incurred in the
acquisition of capital assets including allocations of interest
costs incurred during periods that assets are under construction
or refurbishment. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense as incurred. Costs of property sold or
retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed
from the accounts; resulting gains or losses are included in
income. Jackup drilling rigs and semisubmersibles are
depreciated over lives ranging from 15 to 30years, with
salvage values of $05million and $10million,
respectively, per rig. All land drilling rigs are depreciated
over 15-year lives with no salvage value. Drillships, with the
exception of the Glomar Explorer, are depreciated over
20-year lives, with salvage values of $10million per rig.
The Glomar Explorer is being depreciated over the time
that remained on its 30-year lease as of the date it entered
service following its conversion to a drillship, or
approximately 28years, with no salvage value. Rigs and drilling equipment included
$11billion of assets recorded under capital leases at
December31, 2003, and $10billion at
December31, 2002. Accumulated amortization of assets under
capital leases totaled $1858million and
$1342million at December31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The Company reviews its long-term assets for
impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No144, Accounting for the
Impairment and Disposal of Long-lived Assets.
SFASNo144 requires that long-lived assets and
certain intangibles to be held and used be reported at the lower
of carrying amount or fair value. Assets to be disposed of and
assets not expected to provide any future service potential to
the Company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair
value less cost to sell. The Company recorded no impairment
charges during the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 or
2001. Oil and Gas
Properties. The Company uses the
full-cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and
development costs. Under this method of accounting, the Company
capitalizes all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration
and development of oil and gas properties and amortizes such
costs, together with estimated future development and
dismantlement costs, using the units-of-production method. Costs of offshore unproved properties and
development projects are not amortized until they are fully
evaluated. Unproved oil and gas properties totaled approximately
$29million at December31, 2003. All unproved
properties are reviewed periodically to ascertain if impairment
has occurred. If the results of an 64 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
assessment indicate that the properties are
impaired, the amount of the impairment is added to the
capitalized costs to be amortized. Costs of proved oil and gas
properties that exceed the present value of estimated future net
revenues are charged to expense. Sales of proved and unproved properties are
accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no gain
or loss recognized, unless such adjustments would significantly
alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved
reserves of oil and gas attributable to a cost center, in which
case the gain or loss is recognized in income. Abandonments of
properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs
with no loss recognized.   
Intersegment Turnkey Drilling
Profits The Company defers all turnkey drilling profit
related to wells in which Challenger Minerals Inc.
CMI was the operator and defers turnkey profit up
to the share of CMIs costs in properties in which CMI
holds a working interest. This turnkey profit is credited to the
Companys full cost pool of oil and gas properties and will
be recognized through a lower depletion rate as reserves are
produced.   
Goodwill The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets annually for impairment and in interim
periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying
value of goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets may
be impaired in accordance with the provisions of
SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. The Company has defined reporting units within
its contract drilling segment based upon economic and market
characteristics of these units. All of the goodwill recorded in
connection with the Merger see Note1has been
allocated to the jackup drilling fleet reporting unit, as these
rigs were the primary source of value in the Merger discussions
and negotiations. The estimated fair value of this reporting
unit for purposes of the Companys annual goodwill
impairment testing is based upon the present value of its
estimated future net cash flows, utilizing a discount rate based
upon the Companys cost of capital. The Company has
completed its goodwill impairment testing for 2003 and was not
required to record a goodwill impairment loss. At December31, 2003, Goodwill in the
Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet totaled approximately
$3521million, substantially all of which was recorded in
connection with the Merger see Note1. Goodwill decreased
by $348million from $3869million at
December31, 2002, due primarily to the adjustment during
2003 of certain pre-Merger foreign tax contingencies.   
Revenue Recognition The Companys contract drilling business
provides rigs and rig crews to customers on a dayrate basis.
Dayrate contracts can be for a specified period of time or the
time required to drill a specified well or number of wells.
Revenues and expenses from dayrate drilling operations, which
are classified under contract drilling services, are recognized
on a per-day basis as the work progresses. Lump-sum fees
received as compensation for the cost of relocating drilling
rigs from one major operating area to another, whether received
up-front or upon termination of the drilling contract, are
recognized as earned, which is generally over the term of the
related drilling contract. The Company also designs and executes specific
offshore drilling or well-completion programs for customers at
fixed prices under short-term turnkey contracts.
Revenues and expenses from turnkey contracts, which are
classified under drilling management services, are earned and
recognized upon completion of each contract. The Company recognizes revenue from oil and gas
production at the time title transfers. 65 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
The Company recognizes as revenue reimbursements
received from customers for certain out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Company. Reimbursable revenues have no effect on
operating income.   
Derivative Financial
Instruments From time to time, the Company may make use of
derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to
fluctuations in cash flows, interest rates or foreign currency
exchange rates. The Company accounts for its derivative
financial instruments pursuant to SFASNo133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, as amended by SFASNo138,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities an amendment of FASB Statement
No133, as amended by SFASNo149,
Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities. Derivative instruments held by the
Company at December31, 2003, include dayrate contracts on
two of the Companys drilling rigs that are indexed to
exchange-traded oil futures contracts, various commodity caps,
swaps and floors used to mitigate the Companys exposure to
fluctuations in the fair values of these dayrate contracts, and
certain fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps related to a
portion of the Companys long-term debt see Note7.   
Foreign Currency Transactions The United States dollar is the functional
currency for all of the Companys operations. Realized and
unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses are
recorded in income. The Company may be exposed to the risk of foreign
currency exchange losses in connection with its foreign
operations. Such losses are the result of holding net monetary
assets cash and receivables in excess of payables denominated
in foreign currencies during periods of a strengthening
U.S.dollar. The Company attempts to lessen the impact of
exchange rate changes by requiring customer payments to be
primarily in U.S.dollars, by keeping foreign cash balances
at minimal levels and by not speculating in foreign currencies.   
Income Taxes The Company is a Cayman Islands company. The
Cayman Islands does not impose corporate income taxes.
Consequently, income taxes have been provided based on the tax
laws and rates in effect in the countries in which the
operations are conducted and income is earned. The Company has not provided for deferred taxes
on the unremitted earnings of its U.S. subsidiaries and their
foreign subsidiaries U.S. Subsidiaries that are
permanently reinvested. Should the Company make a distribution
from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries, it would be
required to record additional U.S. and foreign deferred taxes.   
Stock-Based Compensation
Plans The Company accounts for its stock option and
stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic-value method
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board APB
Opinion No25. Accordingly, the Company computes
compensation cost for each employee stock option granted as the
amount by which the quoted market price of the Companys
common stock on the date of grant exceeds the amount the
employee must pay to acquire the stock. The amount of
compensation cost, if any, is charged to income over the vesting
period. No compensation cost has been recognized for options
granted under the Companys Employee Share Purchase Plan or
for any of the Companys outstanding stock options, all of
which stock options have exercise prices equal to the market
price of the stock on the date of grant. The Company does,
however, recognize compensation cost for all grants of
performance-based stock awards see Note8. 66 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Had compensation cost for the Companys
stock-based compensation plans been determined based on fair
values as of the dates of grant, the Companys net income
and earnings per share would have been reported as follows

The pro forma figures in the preceding table may
not be representative of pro forma amounts in future years. The weighted average per share fair value of
stock options as of the grant date was $1081 in 2003, $1568 in
2002 and $1455 in 2001. The weighted average per share fair
value of the outstanding SantaFe International stock
options at November20, 2001 was $494. The value of
options granted under the Employee Share Purchase Plan was
$878per share and $961per share for 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The per share fair value of the Companys
performance-based stock awards as of the grant date was $2392
in 2002 and $2936 in 2001. The Company did not grant any
performance-based stock awards in 2003. Estimates of fair values of stock options,
options granted under the Employee Share Purchase Plan and
performance-based stock awards on the grant dates for purposes
of calculating the pro forma data in the table above were
computed using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on

As of December31, 2003, the Company changed
its assumption as to the expected lives of stock option awards
from a single award method to a tranche-based method. This
method treats an option grant as if it were a series of awards
with separate expected lives rather than a single award. Under
this method, a greater portion of pro forma compensation expense
related to an option award will be recognized in the earlier
years of the option vesting periods because the early years are
also part of the vesting period for later awards in the series.
The Company has revised its pro forma stock-based compensation
disclosures in the table above to reflect the use of this
tranche-based method. 67 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions.
These estimates and assumptions affect the carrying values of
assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of
revenues and expenses recognized during the period. Actual
results could differ from such estimates.   
Note3
Investments At December31, 2003 and 2002, the Company
held various debt securities consisting primarily of commercial
paper, U.S.Treasury notes, money market funds and
Eurodollar time deposits with maturity dates up to
12months that are classified as marketable securities on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company also held
approximately $700million of U.S.Treasury notes
with maturities between 13 and 18months that are included
in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at
December31, 2003. These debt securities have been
designated as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost.
The fair value of these investments approximated their carrying
value at December31, 2003 and 2002. In addition, the Company had other investments in
debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale held
in connection with certain nonqualified pension plans. These
investments, which were included in Other assets at
December31, are disclosed in the table that follows

SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
On February11, 2003, the Company issued
$250million of 5%Notes due 2013 the
5%Notes in a private placement and received
cash proceeds of approximately $2474million after
deduction for discount, underwriting fees and expenses. The
5%Notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company
and rank equally with all other senior unsecured indebtedness of
the Company. The 5%Notes, however, have a junior position
to the claims of holders of the indebtedness and capital lease
obligations of Global Marine and its subsidiaries on Global
Marines assets and earnings. The indenture relating to the
5%Notes contains limitations on the Companys ability
to incur indebtedness for borrowed money secured by certain
liens and on its ability to engage in certain sale/leaseback
transactions. The indenture, however, does not restrict the
Companys ability to incur additional senior indebtedness.
Interest on the 5%Notes is payable on February15 and
August15 of each year. No principal payments are required
with respect to the 5%Notes prior to their final maturity
date. The Company may redeem the 5%Notes in whole
or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a price equal
to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest to the
redemption date, plus a premium relating to the then-prevailing
Treasury Yield and the remaining life of the notes. The Zero Coupon Convertible debentures were
issued at a price of $49960per debenture, which
represents a yield to maturity of 35%per annum to reach
an accreted value at maturity of $1,000per debenture. The
Company has the right to redeem the debentures in whole or in
part on or after June23, 2005, at a price equal to the
issuance price plus accrued original issue discount through the
date of redemption. Each debenture is convertible into 8125103
GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares 4,875,062 total shares at the
option of the holder at any time prior to maturity, unless
previously redeemed. Holders have the right to require the
Company to repurchase the debentures on June23, 2005,
June23, 2010, and June23, 2015, at a price per
debenture of $59425 on June23, 2005, $70682per
debenture on June23, 2010, and $84073per debenture
on June23, 2015. These prices represent the accreted value
through the date of repurchase. The Company may pay the
repurchase price with either cash or shares or a combination
thereof. The Company does not anticipate using stock to satisfy
any such future repurchase obligation. No principal payments are required with respect
to either the 71/8%Notes or the 7%Notes prior
to their final maturity date. The Company may redeem the
71/8%Notes and the 7%Notes in whole at any
time, or in part from time to time, at a price equal to 100% of
the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, if any, to
the date of redemption, plus a premium, if any, relating to the
then-prevailing Treasury Yield and the remaining life of the
notes. The indentures relating to the Zero Coupon
Convertible Debentures, the 71/8%Notes and
7%Notes contain limitations on Global Marines
ability to incur indebtedness for borrowed money secured by
certain liens and to engage in certain sale/leaseback
transactions. The Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures,
71/8%Notes and 7%Notes continue to be
obligations solely of Global Marine and the Company has not
guaranteed any of these obligations. The Company is the sole
obligor under the 5%Notes.   
Note5
Commitments and Contingencies At December31, 2003, the Company had office
space and equipment under operating leases with remaining terms
ranging from approximately one to 10 years. Certain of the
leases may be renewed at the Companys option, and some are
subject to rent revisions based on the Consumer Price Index or
increases in building operating costs. In addition, at
December31, 2003, the Britannia cantilevered jackup
and the Glomar Explorer drillship were held under capital
lease through 2007 and 2026, respectively. Total rent expense
was $798million for 2003, $739million for 2002,
and $1169million for 2001. Included in rent expense was
the rental of offshore drilling rigs used in the Companys
turnkey operations totaling $606million for 2003 550million for 2002, and $1099million for 2001. 69 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND

As of December31, 2003, the Company had
operating leases in place for SantaFe Internationals
offices in Dallas, Texas and Aberdeen, Scotland, and Global
Marines office in Lafayette, Louisiana, which have been
closed as part of the restructuring program described in
Note1. These costs are included in the table above. Costs
associated with the closure of SantaFe
Internationals offices in Dallas and Aberdeen totaling
approximately $115million were recognized as a liability
assumed in the Merger and included in the cost of acquisition in
accordance with SFASNo141, Business
Combinations. Estimated costs related to the closure of
Global Marines Lafayette office along with the
consolidation of the Companys offices in Aberdeen and
Houston totaling approximately $43million were accrued as
part of Restructuring costs in the consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December31, 2001. These
estimated costs assumed that Global Marines Houston office
would be subleased to a third party. The Company, however, has
not yet entered into such a transaction. Consequently, the
Company revised its original estimate of closure costs
associated with Global Marines former office space to
$112million, which represents the Companys entire
liability under the lease. In January 2003, the Company entered into a
lease-leaseback arrangement with a European bank related to the
Companys Britannia cantilevered jackup. Pursuant to
this arrangement, the Company leased the Britannia to the
bank for a five-year term for a lump-sum payment of
approximately $37million, net of origination fees of
approximately $15million. The bank then leased the rig
back to the Company for a five-year term with an effective
annual interest rate based on the 3-month British Pound Sterling
LIBOR plus a margin of 0625%, under which the Company makes
annual lease payments of approximately $80million,
payable in advance. The Company has classified this arrangement
as a capital lease. In March 2002, the Company entered into a
sublease agreement with BP America Inc. for the Companys
current executive offices located at 15375 Memorial Drive,
Houston, Texas. This sublease expires in September 2009. Lease
payments pursuant to this sublease total $23million per
year. In July 2002, the Company also entered into an 11-year
lease for the Companys Aberdeen, Scotland, office.
Payments pursuant to this lease total 597,000
approximately $1million per year. Payments under this
lease may be adjusted every five years beginning in February
2004, subject to a maximum of 650,000per year. 70 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Capital Commitments The Company currently has contracts with PPL
Shipyard PTE, Ltd. of Singapore PPL for
construction of two ultra-deepwater semisubmersibles and one
high-performance cantilevered jackup, with options for two
additional similarly priced semisubmersibles. In June 2003, the
Company took delivery of the GSF ConstellationI,
the first of two high-performance cantilevered jackups ordered
from PPL, at a total cost of $133million, excluding
capitalized interest, capital spares, startup expenses and
mobilization costs. Contractual obligations in connection with
the remaining high-performance cantilevered jackup, the GSF
ConstellationII, excluding capitalized interest,
capital spares, startup expenses and mobilization costs, are
also expected to total approximately $133million, of which
$118million had been incurred as of December31,
2003. Contractual obligations in connection with the two
ultra-deepwater semisubmersibles, excluding capitalized
interest, capital spares, startup expenses and mobilization
costs, are expected to total approximately $570million, or
an average of $285million per rig. Of the
$570million, $436million had been incurred as of
December31, 2003. CMI currently holds a 16% working interest in a
development project in the North Sea. CMIs portion of the
development costs of this project is expected to total
approximately 147million $250million. Of
the $250million, approximately $101million had
been incurred as of December31, 2003.   
Legal Proceedings The Company and two of its subsidiaries are
defendants in a lawsuit filed on July28, 2003, by
Transocean Inc. Transocean in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston
Division. The lawsuit alleges that the dual drilling structure
and method utilized by the Companys two ultra-deepwater
semisubmersibles under construction in Singapore infringe on
United States patents granted to Transocean. The lawsuit seeks
damages, royalties and attorneys fees, together with an
injunction that would prevent the use of the dual drilling
capabilities of the rigs. The Company believes that the lawsuit
is without merit and intends to vigorously defend it. The trial
of this lawsuit has been scheduled for December 2005. The
Company does not expect that the matter will have a material
adverse effect on the Companys business or financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. A subsidiary of the Company filed suit in
February 2004 against its insurance underwriters in the Superior
Court of San Francisco County, California, seeking a declaration
as to its rights to insurance coverage and the proper allocation
among its insurers of liability for claims payments in order to
assist in the future management and disposition of certain
claims described below. The subsidiary is continuing to receive
payment from its insurers for claim settlements and legal costs,
and expects to continue to receive such payments during the
pendency of this action. The insurance coverage in question relates to
lawsuits filed against the subsidiary arising out of its
involvement in the design, construction and refurbishment of
major industrial complexes. The operating assets of the
subsidiary were sold and its operations discontinued in 1989,
and the subsidiary has no remaining assets other than the
insurance policies involved in the litigation. The subsidiary
has been named as a defendant, along with numerous other
companies, in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of
exposure to asbestos. To date, the subsidiary has been named as
a defendant in approximately 2,700 lawsuits, the first of which
was filed in 1990. Of the 2,700 lawsuits, approximately 1,700
have been resolved, with approximately 1,000 currently pending.
Over the course of the past fourteen years approximately $185
million has been expended to settle these claims with the
subsidiary having expended $34 million of that amount due to
insurance deductible obligations, all of which have now been
satisfied. Insurers have funded the balance of the settlement
costs and all legal costs associated therewith. The subsidiary
has in excess of $1billion in insurance limits that it
believes will be available to cover future claims. The Company
does not believe that these claims will have any material impact
on the Companys consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows. 71 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Environmental Matters The Company has certain potential liabilities
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act CERCLA and similar state acts
regulating cleanup of various hazardous waste disposal sites,
including those described below. CERCLA is intended to expedite
the remediation of hazardous substances without regard to fault.
Potentially responsible parties PRPs for each site
include present and former owners and operators of, transporters
to and generators of the substances at the site. Liability is
strict and can be joint and several. The Company has been named as a PRP in connection
with a site located in SantaFe Springs, California, known
as the Waste Disposal,Inc. site. The Company and other
PRPs have agreed with the U.S.Environmental Protection
Agency EPA and the U.S.Department of Justice
DOJ to settle their potential liabilities for this
site by agreeing to perform the remaining remediation required
by the EPA. The form of the agreement is a consent decree, which
has now been entered by the court. The parties to the settlement
have entered into a participation agreement, which makes the
Company liable for an estimated 77% of the remediation costs.
Although the remediation costs cannot be determined with
certainty until the remediation is complete, the Company expects
that its share of the remaining remediation costs will not
exceed approximately $800,000. There are additional potential
liabilities related to the site, but these cannot be quantified,
and the Company has no reason at this time to believe that they
will be material. The Company has also been named as a PRP in
connection with a site in California known as the Casmalia
Resources Site. The Company and other PRPs have entered into an
agreement with the EPA and the DOJ to resolve their potential
liabilities. Under the settlement, the Company is not likely to
owe any substantial additional amounts for this site beyond what
the Company has already paid. There are additional potential
liabilities related to this site, but these cannot be quantified
at this time, and the Company has no reason at this time to
believe that they will be material. The Company has been named as one of many PRPs in
connection with a site located in Carson, California, formerly
maintained by Cal Compact Landfill. On February15, 2002,
the Company was served with a required 90-day notification that
eight California cities, on behalf of themselves and other PRPs,
intend to commence an action against the Company under the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA. On
April1, 2002, a complaint was filed by the cities against
the Company and others alleging that they have liabilities in
connection with the site. However, the complaint has not been
served. The site was closed in or around 1965, and the Company
does not have sufficient information to enable it to assess its
potential liability, if any, for this site. Resolutions of other claims by the EPA, the
involved state agency and/or PRPs are at various stages of
investigation. These investigations involve determinations of   
the actual responsibility attributed to the
Company and the other PRPs at the site;
appropriate investigatory and/or remedial
actions;and
allocation of the costs of such activities among
the PRPs and other site users.
The Companys ultimate financial
responsibility in connection with those sites may depend on many
factors, including   
the volume and nature of material, if any,
contributed to the site for which the Company is responsible;
the numbers of other PRPs and their financial
viability;and
the remediation methods and technology to be used.
It is difficult to quantify with certainty the
potential cost of these environmental matters, particularly in
respect of remediation obligations. Nevertheless, based upon the
information currently available, the 72 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Company believes that its ultimate liability
arising from all environmental matters, including the liability
for all other related pending legal proceedings, asserted legal
claims and known potential legal claims which are likely to be
asserted, is adequately accrued and should not have a material
effect on the Companys financial position or ongoing
results of operations. Estimated costs of future expenditures
for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to
their present value.   
Contingencies and Other Legal
Matters In 1998, the Company entered into fixed-price
contracts for the construction of two dynamically positioned,
ultra-deepwater drillships, the Glomar C.R. Luigs and the
Glomar Jack Ryan, which began operating in April and
December 2000, respectively. Pursuant to two 20-year capital
lease agreements, the Company subsequently novated the
construction contracts for the drillships to two financial
institutions the Lessors, which now own the
drillships and lease them to the Company. The Company has
deposited with three large foreign banks the Payment
Banks amounts equal to the progress payments that the
Lessors were required to make under the construction contracts,
less a lease benefit of approximately $62million the
Defeasance Payment. In exchange for the deposits,
the Payment Banks have assumed liability for making rental
payments required under the leases and the Lessors have legally
released the Company as the primary obligor of such rental
payments. Accordingly, the Company has recorded no capital lease
obligations on its balance sheet with respect to the two
drillships. The Company has interest rate risk in connection
with these fully defeased financing leases for the Glomar
Jack Ryan and Glomar C. R. Luigs. The Defeasance
Payment earns interest based on the British Pound Sterling
three-month LIBOR, which approximated 800% at the time of the
agreement. Should the Defeasance Payment earn less than the
assumed 800% rate of interest, the Company will be required to
make additional payments as necessary to augment the annual
payments made by the Payment Banks pursuant to the agreements.
If the December31, 2003, LIBOR rate of 404% were to
continue over the next nine years, the Company would be required
to fund an additional estimated $57million during that
period. Any additional payments made by the Company pursuant to
the financing leases would increase the carrying value of its
leasehold interest in the rigs and therefore be reflected in
higher depreciation expense over their then-remaining useful
lives. The Company does not expect that, if required, any
additional payments made under these leases would be material to
its financial position, results of operations or cash flows in
any given year. The Company and its subsidiaries are defendants
or otherwise involved in a number of lawsuits in the ordinary
course of business. In the opinion of management, the
Companys ultimate liability with respect to these pending
lawsuits is not expected to have a material adverse effect on
its consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

effect of the unrealized holding gains and losses was immaterial
for all periods presented.   
Note7
Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair
Values of Financial Instruments   
Derivative Instruments Two of the Companys cantilevered jackup
rigs are currently operating under similar dayrate contracts
that expose the Company to commodity price risk. These two-year
agreements, expiring in May 2004 and October 2004, respectively,
each contain a variable-dayrate formula linked to crude oil
prices, whereby dayrates earned under these contracts increase
or decrease in response to increases or decreases in oil prices.
Dayrates under these agreements are calculated using a sliding
scale formula based on the arithmetic average of the daily
closing price of Light Sweet Crude on the NewYork
Mercantile Exchange NYMEX, subject to a maximum of
$2800per barrel and a minimum of $1200per barrel. The variable-dayrate formula contained in these
agreements is comprised of multiple embedded derivative
financial instruments as defined in SFASNo133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. The fair values of these embedded derivatives
fluctuate in response to changes in oil prices. The net fair
values, based upon market price, of the embedded derivatives in
each of these contracts were assets of approximately
$22million and $34million, respectively, at
December31, 2003, or $56million in the aggregate. As part of the Companys overall risk
management strategy, the Company has entered into a number of
commodity caps, swaps and floors designed to mitigate its
exposure to fluctuations in fair values of the embedded
derivatives in these contracts resulting from changes in oil
prices. The fair values of these derivative financial
instruments represented a total liability of $56million
at December31, 2003. These embedded derivative financial instruments
and related commodity caps, swaps and floors have not been
designated as hedges. Accordingly, all changes in the fair
values of these instruments are recognized currently in earnings. The Company manages its fair value risk related
to its long-term debt by using interest rate swaps to convert a
portion of its fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. Under
these interest rate swaps, the Company agrees with other parties
to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between the
fixed-rate and floating-rate amounts, calculated by reference to
an agreed-upon notional amount. In October 2002, the Company entered into a
fixed-for-floating interest rate swap with a notional amount of
$50million, effective October 2002 through September 2007.
This interest rate swap is intended to manage a portion of the
fair value risk related to the Companys
71/8%Notes. Under the terms of this swap, the
Company has agreed to pay the counterparty an interest rate
equal to the six-month LIBOR rate plus 330basis points on
the notional amount, and the Company will receive the fixed
71/8% rate. The estimated fair value of this swap was an
asset of approximately $16million at both
December31, 2003 and 2002. The Company has designated this
swap as a fair value hedge of a portion of the
71/8%Notes. In August 2003, the Company entered into
fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate
notional amount of $100million, effective August 2003
through February 2013. These interest rate swaps are intended to
manage a portion of the fair value risk related to the
Companys 5%Notes. Under the terms of these swaps,
the Company has agreed to pay the counterparties an interest
rate equal to the six-month LIBOR rate less 0247% to 040% on
the notional amounts and the Company will receive the fixed
500% rate. The estimated aggregate fair value of these swaps at
December31, 2003, was an asset of $50million. The
Company has designated these swaps as fair value hedges of a
portion of the 5%Notes. 74 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Fair Values of Financial
Instruments The estimated fair value of the Companys
$300million principal amount 71/8%Notes due
2007, based on quoted market prices, was $3392million at
December31, 2003, compared to the carrying amount of
$3014million. The estimated fair value of the
Companys $300million principal amount 7%Notes
due 2028, based on quoted market prices, was $3315million
at December31, 2003, compared to the carrying amount of
$2969million. The estimated fair value of the
Companys $600million Zero Coupon Convertible
Debentures due 2020, based on quoted market prices, was
$3443million at December31, 2003, compared to the
carrying amount of $3387million. The estimated fair value
of the Companys $250million principal amount
5%Notes due 2013, based on quoted market prices, was
$2506million at December31, 2003, compared to the
carrying amount of $2544million. The fair values of the Companys cash
equivalents, marketable securities, trade receivables, and trade
payables approximated their carrying values due to the
short-term nature of these instruments see Note3.   
Concentrations of Credit Risk The market for the Companys services and
products is the offshore oil and gas industry, and the
Companys customers consist primarily of major integrated
international oil companies and independent oil and gas
producers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of
its customers and has not historically required material
collateral. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit
losses, and such losses have been within managements
expectations. The Companys cash deposits were distributed
among various banks in the areas of the Companys
operations throughout the world as of December31, 2003. In
addition, the Company had commercial paper, U.S.Treasury
notes, money-market funds and Eurodollar time deposits with a
variety of financial institutions. As a result, the Company
believes that credit risk in such instruments is minimal.   
Note8
Stock-Based Compensation Plans The Company has stock-based compensation plans
under which it may grant shares of the Companys ordinary
shares or options to purchase a fixed number of shares. Stock
options and performance-based stock awards granted under the
Companys various stock-based compensation plans vest over
two to four years. Stock options expire ten years after the
grant date. As a result of the Merger, all options to
purchase Global Marine stock outstanding as of November20,
2001, the effective date of the Merger, became immediately
exercisable and were converted into options to purchase
GlobalSantaFe Ordinary Shares. All options to purchase
SantaFe International ordinary shares that were
outstanding as of the Merger date also became immediately
exercisable pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. At December31, 2003, there were a total of
4,498,535shares available for future grants under the
Companys various stock-based compensation plans, including
1,076,586shares reserved for issuance under the
Companys Employee Share Purchase Plan discussed below. 75 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND

Employee Share Purchase Plan On May6, 2003, the Companys
shareholders approved an amendment and restatement to the
GlobalSantaFe Corporation 1997 Employee Share Purchase Plan
the 1997 Plan to increase the authorized shares
from 1,145,000 to 2,145,000 and rename the 1997 Plan the
GlobalSantaFe Employee Share Purchase Plan the Share
Purchase Plan. In December 2003, the Company filed a
registration statement on FormS-8 with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to register an additional 1,000,000 of the
Companys ordinary shares for offering and sale under the
Share Purchase Plan. The Share Purchase Plan is designed to furnish
eligible employees of the Company and designated subsidiaries of
the Company an incentive to advance the best interests of the
Company by providing a formal program whereby they may
voluntarily purchase ordinary shares of the Company at a
favorable price and upon favorable terms. Generally speaking,
substantially all covered employees who are scheduled to work an
average of at least 20hours per week are eligible to
participate in the Share Purchase Plan. Once a year, participants in the Share Purchase
Plan will be granted options to purchase ordinary shares with a
fair market value no greater than the lesser of 10% of the
participants eligible compensation as defined in the
Share Purchase Plan and the amount specified in
Section423b of the Code currently $25,000. The
exercise price of the options is 85% of the fair market value of
the ordinary shares on the date of the grant, or the date of
exercise, whichever is less. Options granted under the Share
Purchase Plan are exercisable on the date one year after the
date of grant. Generally, participants pay option exercise
prices through payroll deductions made ratably throughout the
year. The Company granted options to purchase a total of 250,900
ordinary shares and 263,713 ordinary shares under the Share
Purchase Plan in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The fair value of
options granted under the Share Purchase Plan as of the grant
date was $878per share for 2003 and $961per share
for 2002.   
Performance-Based Stock
Awards From time to time, the Company offers ordinary
shares to certain key employees at nominal or no cost to the
employee. Under the Companys current plan, which covers
grants made in 2002 in the table below, the exact number of
shares that each employee received was dependent on Company
performance over a one-year period as measured against
performance goals with respect to operating performance and cash
flow, among other measures. The performance period applicable to
each offer ended on December31 of the year of the grant,
and the shares received by participants on that date were then
restricted for an additional three-year vesting period, subject
to acceleration upon the occurrence of certain events. Data for
2001 represents shares granted under the Global Marine plan. The
Company did not grant any performance-based stock awards in
2003. A summary of the status of performance-based stock awards
is presented in the table that follows

Retirement Plans Pensions The Company has defined benefit pension plans in
the United States and the United Kingdom covering all of its
U.S.employees and a portion of its
non-U.S.employees. The Companys U.S. qualified plans
are subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 ERISA. The Companys
qualified plans are also designed and operated to be in
compliance with the applicable requirements of the respective
U.S. and U.K. tax codes for qualified plans and, as such, are
not subject to income taxes. For the most part, benefits are
based on the employees length of service and average
earnings for the highest consecutive 60months of
compensation during the last ten years of service. Substantially
all benefits are paid from funds previously provided to
trustees. The Company is the sole contributor to the plans, with
the exception of one of the Companys plans in the U.K.,
and its funding objective is to fund participants benefits
under the plans as they accrue. The Company uses a December31 measurement
date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans. The
following table shows the changes in the projected benefit
obligation and assets for all pension plans for the year ended
December31 and a reconciliation of the plans funded

During 2002, the Company made certain amendments
to its pension plans which changed, among other things,
calculations of retirement benefit formulas, the amount of
compensation included in these calculations and formulas used
for the determination of early retirement benefits. These
amendments were made to conform benefits received under the
Global Marine and SantaFe International plans. Benefits
paid for 2003 and 2002 included approximately $48million
and $114million, respectively, of lump-sum termination
payments made as a result of the Merger. The following table provides information related
to those plans that were underfunded, including the nonqualified
plans discussed below, as of December31. In the table
below, the projected benefit obligation PBO is the
actuarially computed present value of earned benefits based on
service to date and includes the estimated effect of future
salary increases. The accumulated benefit obligation
ABO is the actuarially computed present value of
earned benefits based on service to date, but differs from the
PBO in that it is based on current salary levels.

The discount rate used to calculate the net
present value of future benefit obligations is based on the
average of current rates earned on long-term bonds that receive
a Moodys rating of Aa or better. The Company employs third-party consultants for
its U.S.plans who use a portfolio return model to assess
the initial reasonableness of the expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets assumption. Using asset class return,
variance and correlation assumptions, the model produces both
the expected return and the distribution of possible returns at
every fifth percentile for the chosen portfolio. Return
assumptions developed by these consultants are forward-looking
gross returns. The building block approach used by the portfolio
return model begins with the current Treasury yield curve,
recognizing that expected returns on bonds are heavily
influenced by the current level of yields. The model then adds
corporate bond spreads and equity risk premiums, based on
current conditions, to develop the return expectations for each
asset class based on the investment mix for the Companys
pension plans. The volatility and correlation assumptions are
also forward-looking: they take into account historical
relationships, but are adjusted by the Companys
consultants to reflect expected capital market trends.   
Plan Assets The Companys objective with regard to its
allocation of pension assets is to limit the variability of its
pension funding requirements, while maintaining funding at
levels that will ensure the payment of obligations as they come
due. The Companys strategy in achieving this objective is
to allocate its pension assets in a mix that will achieve an
optimal rate of return considering the anticipated timing of its
pension benefit obligations. The Company determines its asset allocations by
performing an asset/ liability analysis for its various pension
plans based on the demographics of plan participants, including
compensation levels and estimated remaining service lives, to
determine the timing and amounts of its benefit obligations
under the various plans. This consultant then recommends the
optimal asset allocations for the pension trust assets within
the guidelines set by the Company. The Companys weighted-average asset
allocations for its various pension plans at December31,
2003, and 2002, by asset category are as follows

The Company expects the long-term target asset
allocations for its pension plan assets to average 70% for
equity securities and 30% for fixed-income securities for the
Companys U.S.plans. The Company expects its
long-term target asset allocations for pension assets for its
U.K. plans to average 90% for equity securities and 10% for
fixed-income securities.   
Funding As noted previously, the Companys funding
objective is to fund participants benefits under the plans
as they accrue. Although the Company expects that there will be
no minimum pension contribution required under ERISA guidelines
to the Companys qualified plans for 2004, the Company has
funded the plans in the past on a regular basis. Accordingly,
the Company may make discretionary contributions, which will be
determined after the 2004 actuarial valuations are complete. 81 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Other Postretirement Benefits The Company provides health care benefits to all
retirees who are U.S.citizens and to certain
non-U.S.citizen employees who were participants in a
U.S.based health care plan at the time of their retirement
and elect to enroll for continued coverage. Generally, employees
who have reached the age of 55 and have rendered a minimum of
five years of service are eligible for postretirement health
care benefits. For the most part, health care benefits require a
contribution from the retiree. Prior to July1, 2002, the
Company also provided term life insurance to certain retirees,
both U.S.citizens and non-U.S.citizens. Liabilities
for postretirement health care and life insurance benefits were
$154million and $139million at December31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. The weighted-average annual assumed rate of
increase in the per capita cost of covered postretirement
medical benefits was 10% for 2003 and 11% for 2002 and 2001.
This 10% rate is expected to decrease ratably to 5% in 2009 and
remain at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend rate
assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For
example, as of and for the year ended December31, 2003,
increasing or decreasing the assumed health care cost trend
rates by one percentage point each year would change the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately
$06million and $05million, respectively, and the
aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net
periodic postretirement benefit by approximately $35,000 and
$32,000, respectively. The Company does not consider its postretirement
benefits costs and liabilities to be material to its results of
operations or financial position.   
Defined Contribution Plan The Company has a defined contribution
401k savings plan in which substantially all of
the Companys U.S.employees are eligible to
participate. Company contributions to the 401k savings plan
are based on the amount of employee contributions. The Company
matches 100% of each participants first six percent of
compensation contributed to the plan. Charges to expense with
respect to this plan totaled $74million for both 2003 and
2002 and $52million for 2001.

The 2001 amount is comprised of the net change in
the valuation allowance for the year of $1059million less
$254million of valuation allowance acquired from
SantaFe International at the time of the Merger. The 2003
amount does not include a foreign currency exchange adjustment
of $51million which had no effect on earnings.
The Company intends to permanently reinvest all
of the unremitted earnings of its U.S.Subsidiaries in
their businesses. As a result, the Company has not provided for
U.S.deferred taxes on $14billion of cumulative
unremitted earnings at December31, 2003. Should the
Company make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of its
U.S.Subsidiaries, it would be required to record
additional U.S.deferred taxes. It is not practicable to
estimate the amount of deferred tax liability associated with
these unremitted earnings. In certain circumstances, management expects
that, due to the changing demands of the offshore drilling
markets, certain of the Companys mobile assets are more
likely than not to be redeployed to other locations before those
assets operate in certain jurisdictions long enough to give rise
to future tax consequences. As a result, no deferred tax
liability has been recognized on the earnings from these assets.
During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company revised its
expectations regarding the deployment of certain foreign-owned
assets in the U.S., determining that such assets would operate
predominantly in the U.S.for the remainder of their
expected useful lives and therefore giving rise to future
U.S.tax consequences. As a result, the Company recorded a
$241million deferred tax charge in the fourth quarter of
2003, representing the expected tax consequences of such assets
as of December31, 2003. 83 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND

Based upon anticipated market conditions in the
United States as of December31, 2003 and 2002, the Company
did not adjust the valuation allowance against the U.S.NOL
carryforwards of Global Marine in 2003 or 2002. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance
against its net deferred tax assets in certain foreign
jurisdictions. The net valuation allowance decreased by
approximately $181million in 2003 and increased by
approximately $211million in 2002. The 2003 net decrease
was comprised of the following: a $210million decrease
due to revised earnings projections in the U.K., where the
Company now expects to fully utilize its remaining NOL
carryforward; a $124million decrease due to current year
activity in Trinidad and Tobago, and a $08million
decrease due to activity in various other foreign jurisdictions.
The above decreases were partially offset by a $95million
increase in the valuation allowances in Norway and Venezuela due
to an increase in net operating losses that the Company believes
will more likely than not expire before they are utilized, a
$15million increase due to activity in other foreign
jurisdictions and a $51million increase resulting from
foreign currency translation effects. The 2002 valuation
allowance change reflects a $211million increase in net
deferred tax assets in certain of the Companys foreign
jurisdictions, wherein the respective valuation allowances
changed accordingly. At December31, 2003, the Company had
$6791million of U.S.NOL carryforwards. In addition,
the Company has $152million of non-expiring
U.S.alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards. The
Company has recorded an asset for an interest expense
carryforward in the amount of $61million which is carried
forward indefinitely. The NOL carryforwards, interest expense
carryforward and the U.S.alternative 84 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
minimum tax credit carryforward can be used to
reduce the Companys U.S.federal income taxes payable
in future years. The NOL carryforwards subject to expiration
expire as follows in millions

Includes $1297million of NOL carryforward
amounts from the GSFC.R.Luigs, which
was made part of the U.S.group.
In addition, the Company also had
$426million, $705million and $09million of
non-expiring NOL carryforwards in the United Kingdom, Trinidad
and Tobago and Kuwait, respectively. The Companys ability to realize the benefit
of its deferred tax asset requires that the Company achieve
certain future earnings levels prior to the expiration of its
NOL carryforwards. The Company has established a valuation
allowance against the future tax benefit of a portion of its NOL
carryforwards and could be required to further adjust that
valuation allowance if market conditions change materially and
future earnings are, or are projected to be, significantly
different from its current estimates. The Companys NOL
carryforwards are subject to review and potential disallowance
upon audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where the
loss was incurred. 85 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND

The computation of diluted earnings per share
excludes outstanding stock options with exercise prices greater
than the average market price of the Companys ordinary
shares for the year, because the inclusion of such options would
have the effect of increasing diluted earnings per ordinary
share i.e., their effect would be antidilutive.
The number of antidilutive options that were excluded from
diluted earnings per ordinary share and could potentially dilute
basic earnings per ordinary share in the future were
15,635,120shares in 2003, 9,401,866shares in 2002,
and 4,668,834shares in 2001. Diluted earnings per share for 2003 and 2002 also
excludes 4,875,062 potentially dilutive shares issuable upon
conversion of the Companys Zero Coupon Convertible
Debentures because the inclusion of these shares would be
antidilutive given the level of net income for these periods. As discussed in Note4, holders of the Zero
Coupon Convertible Debentures have the right to require the
Company to repurchase the debentures on June23, 2005,
June23, 2010, and June23, 2015. The Company may pay
the repurchase price with either cash or stock or a combination
thereof. The Company does not anticipate using stock to satisfy
any such future repurchase obligation.

Note13
Segment and Geographic Information The Company has three lines of business, each
organized along the basis of services and products and each with
a separate management team. The Companys three lines of
business are reported as separate operating segments and consist
of contract drilling, drilling management services and oil and
gas. The Companys contract drilling business provides
fully crewed, mobile offshore and land drilling rigs to oil and
gas operators on a daily rate basis and is also referred to as
dayrate drilling. The Companys drilling management
services business provides offshore oil and gas drilling
management services on either a dayrate or completed-project,
fixed-price turnkey basis, as well as drilling
engineering and drilling project management services. The
Companys oil and gas business participates in exploration
and production activities, principally in order to facilitate
the acquisition of turnkey contracts for the Companys
drilling management services operations. The Company evaluates and measures segment
performance on the basis of operating income. Segment operating
income is inclusive of intersegment revenues. Such revenues,
which have been eliminated from the consolidated totals, are
recorded at transfer prices, which are intended to approximate
the prices charged to external customers. Segment operating
income consists of revenues less the related operating costs and
expenses and excludes interest expense, interest income,
restructuring costs and corporate expenses. Segment assets
consist of all current and long-lived assets, exclusive of
affiliate receivables and investments. 87 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND

Transactions with Affiliates In connection with its initial public offering,
SantaFe International entered into an intercompany
agreement with Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and SFIC Holdings,
which agreement was amended in 89 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
connection with the Merger. The intercompany
agreement, as amended, provides that, as long as Kuwait
Petroleum Corporation and its affiliates, in the aggregate, own
at least 10% of the Company, the consent of SFIC Holdings is
required to change the jurisdiction of any existing subsidiary
of the Company or incorporate a new subsidiary in any
jurisdiction in a manner materially adversely affecting the
rights or interests of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and its
affiliates or reincorporate the Company in another jurisdiction.
The intercompany agreement, as amended, also provides SFIC
Holdings the right to designate up to three representatives to
the Companys Board of Directors based on SFIC
Holdings ownership percentage in the Company and provides
SFIC Holdings rights to access certain information concerning
the Company. SFIC Holdings currently holds approximately 186%
of the outstanding ordinary shares of the Company. The Company provides contract drilling services
in Kuwait to the Kuwait Oil Company, K.S.C. KOC, a
subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, and it also provides
contract drilling services to a partially owned affiliate of KOC
in the Kuwait-Saudi Arabian Partitioned Neutral Zone. Such
services are performed pursuant to drilling contracts containing
terms and conditions and rates of compensation that materially
approximate those customarily included in arms-length
contracts of a similar nature. In connection therewith, KOC
provides the Company rent-free use of certain land and
maintenance facilities and has committed to providing same,
subject to the availability of the maintenance facilities,
through the current term of the drilling contracts and
extensions thereof as may be agreed. In relation to its drilling
business in Kuwait, the Company has an agency agreement with a
subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation that obligates the
Company to pay an agency fee based on a percentage of revenues.
The Company believes the terms of this agreement are more
favorable than those which could be obtained with an unrelated
third party in an arms-length negotiation, but the value
of such terms is currently immaterial to the Companys
results of operations. During the year ended December31, 2003, the
Company earned revenues from KOC and its affiliate for
performing contract drilling services in the ordinary course of
business totaling $456million and paid $444,000 of agency
fees pursuant to the agency agreement. During the year ended
December31, 2002, the Company earned revenues from KOC and
its affiliate for performing contract drilling services in the
ordinary course of business totaling $627million and paid
$586,000 of agency fees, and, during the period following the
Merger until December31, 2001, the Company earned revenues
from KOC and its affiliate totaling $69million and paid
$80,000 of agency fees. At December31, 2003 and 2002, the
Company had accounts receivable from affiliates of Kuwait
Petroleum Corporation of $68million and
$111million, respectively.

Summarized Financial Data Global
Marine Inc. and Subsidiaries Global Marine Inc. Global Marine, a
wholly owned subsidiary of GlobalSantaFe Corporation, is a
domestic and international offshore drilling contractor. Global
Marine, through its subsidiaries, provides offshore drilling
services on a dayrate basis in the U.S.Gulf of Mexico and
internationally, with a fleet of 13 mobile offshore drilling
rigs. In addition, Global Marine co-owns a non-U.S. subsidiary
with GlobalSantaFe Corporation which owns 55mobile
offshore and land drilling rigs. Global Marine also provides
drilling management services on a turnkey basis, and engages in
oil and gas exploration, development and production activities,
principally in order to facilitate the acquisition of turnkey
contracts for its drilling management services operations. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company
commenced an internal restructuring to integrate its
non-U.S.operations. In connection with this restructuring,
certain of SantaFe Internationals operations were
combined with those of Global Marines previously wholly
owned non-U.S.subsidiary discussed above. As a result,
Global Marines interest in the combined operations of this
subsidiary was reduced to less than 50% as of December31,
2003. The balance of the interest in this subsidiary is now held
by GlobalSantaFe Corporation. 90 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND

Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2002, the FASB issued
SFASNo148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure, which
amends SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. SFASNo148 provides three
alternative methods of transition and disclosure requirements
for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation: 1the
prospective method, 2the modified prospective method,
and 3the retroactive restatement method. In addition to
providing compensation cost recognition methods,
SFASNo148 also requires certain disclosures,
including the accounting method used for each period presented,
a description of the method used to report the change in
accounting principle and continuing tabular presentation of
proforma net income and earnings per share effects for any
awards outstanding under the intrinsic value method of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25.
SFASNo148 is effective for fiscal years ending
after December15, 2002. The Company has reflected the
disclosure provisions of SFASNo148 in Note2
of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and
currently accounts for stock-based compensation using the
intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No25. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation
No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,
an Interpretation of ARB No51
FIN46. This interpretation provides guidance
on the identification of, and financial reporting for, entities
over which control is achieved through means other than voting
rights, or variable-interest entities VIEs.
FIN46 originally became effective for public entities with
VIEs created before February1, 2003, at the beginning of
the first interim or annual reporting period starting after
June15, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued
FIN46-R, which amended FIN46 to extend its effective
date until the first quarter of 2004 for all types of entities
except special purpose entities. In addition, FIN46-R also
limited the scope of FIN46 to exclude certain joint
ventures or other entities that meet the characteristics of
businesses. Upon the applicable effective date, FIN46 will
become the guidance that determines whether consolidation is
required and whether the variable-interest accounting model must
be used to account for 91 Table of Contents GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
existing and new entities. The Company does not
believe that it currently has any VIEs within the scope of
FIN46. In April 2003, the FASB issued
SFASNo149, Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This
statement amends and clarifies accounting for derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging
activities under SFASNo133. This statement is
effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June30, 2003, with certain exceptions, and for hedging
relationships designated after June30, 2003. The adoption
of SFAS149 did not have a material effect on the
Companys financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. In May 2003 the FASB issued
SFASNo150, Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity. This statement establishes standards for how an
issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial
position certain financial instruments with characteristics of
both liabilities and equity. In accordance with the standard,
financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer are
required to be classified as liabilities. SFAS150 is
effective for such financial instruments, except for those that
apply to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests,
entered into or modified after May31, 2003, and otherwise
was effective for such financial instruments, except for those
that apply to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests,
at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after
June15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS150 did not have a
material effect on the Companys financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision of
SFASNo132, Employers Disclosures about
Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. This revision
the revised SFASNo132 retains some of
the disclosure requirements of SFASNo132 and
requires additional pension and postretirement disclosures,
including, among others, the types of securities included in
plan assets, a description of investment policies and strategies
related to the investment of plan assets, and methods used to
determine assumptions for calculating pension and postretirement
benefit liabilities and costs. In addition, the revised
SFASNo132 requires certain disclosures about net
periodic benefit cost and funding information to be included in
interim reports. The revised SFASNo132 is effective
for fiscal years ending after December31, 2003, and for
interim periods beginning after December31, 2003. The
disclosures related to the Companys pension plans included
in Note9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
include all relevant disclosures required by the revised
SFASNo132. 92 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA

The Company filed a claim in 1993 with the United
Nations Compensation Commission UNCC for losses
suffered as a result of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
The claim was for the loss of four rigs and associated
equipment, lost revenue and miscellaneous expenditures. During
the first quarter of 2003, the Governing Council of the UNCC
awarded the Company compensation in the amount of
$221million in a final, non-appealable, adjudication of
the claim.

Controls and Procedures The Company carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of the Companys
management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of
December31, 2003, pursuant to Rule13a-15b of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in timely alerting them to material information
relating to the Company including its consolidated
subsidiaries required to be included in the Companys
periodic Securities and Exchange Commission filings. There have
been no changes in the Companys internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the Companys last
fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Companys control over
financial reporting. PARTIII
