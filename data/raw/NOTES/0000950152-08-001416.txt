Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors
Allegheny Technologies Incorporated We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Allegheny Technologies Incorporated
and subsidiaries as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2007. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Allegheny Technologies Incorporated and
subsidiaries at December31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As described in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company changed its accounting for
income tax uncertainties in 2007. As described in Note 8 to the financial statements, in 2006 the
Company changed its method of accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits. As
described in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 2005 the Company changed its methods of
accounting for stock-based compensation and conditional asset retirement obligations. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Allegheny Technologies Incorporateds
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated February21, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon. s/ Ernst Young LLP Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements. 53 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Allegheny Technologies Incorporated
and its subsidiaries, including the Chinese joint venture known as Shanghai STAL Precision
Stainless Steel Company Limited STAL, in which the Company has a 60% interest. The remaining
40% interest in STAL is owned by Baosteel Group, a state authorized investment company whose equity
securities are publicly traded in the Peoples Republic of China. The financial results of STAL are
consolidated into the Companys operating results with the 40% interest of the Companys minority
partner recognized on the statement of income as other income or expense, and on the balance sheet
in other long-term liabilities. Investments in which the Company exercises significant influence,
but which it does not control generally a 20% to 50% ownership interest, are accounted for under
the equity method of accounting. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. Unless the context requires otherwise, Allegheny Technologies, ATI and the
Company refer to Allegheny Technologies Incorporated and its subsidiaries. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the
reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Management believes that the estimates are reasonable. Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments valued at cost, which approximates fair value,
acquired with an original maturity of three months or less. The Companys investments in debt and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale
and are reported at fair values, with net unrealized appreciation and depreciation on investments
reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are presented net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of $63million at
December31, 2007, and $57million at December31, 2006. The Company markets its products to a
diverse customer base, principally throughout the United States. Trade credit is extended based
upon evaluations of each customers ability to perform its obligations, which are updated
periodically. Accounts receivable reserves are determined based upon an aging of accounts and a
review for collectibility of specific accounts. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of
sales in 2007. Accounts receivable from Uniti were $125million at December31, 2007. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost last-in, first-out LIFO, first-in, first-out FIFO,
and average cost methods or market, less progress payments. Costs include direct material, direct
labor and applicable manufacturing and engineering overhead, and other direct costs. Most of the
Companys inventory is valued utilizing the LIFO costing methodology. Inventory of the Companys
non-U.S. operations is valued using average cost or FIFO methods. The Company evaluates product lines on a quarterly basis to identify inventory values that
exceed estimated net realizable value. The calculation of a resulting reserve, if any, is
recognized as an expense in the period that the need for the reserve is identified. It is the
Companys general policy to write-down to scrap value any inventory that is identified as obsolete
and any inventory that has aged or has not moved in more than twelve months. In some instances this
criterion is up to twenty-four months. 54 Table of Contents Long-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including capitalized interest, and includes
long-lived assets acquired under capital leases. The principal method of depreciation adopted for
all property placed into service after July1, 1996 is the straight-line method. For buildings and
equipment acquired prior to July1, 1996, depreciation is computed using a combination of
accelerated and straight-line methods. Significant enhancements that extend the lives of property
and equipment are capitalized. Costs related to repairs and maintenance are charged to expense in
the year incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired
or disposed of are removed from the accounts and any related gains or losses are included in
income. The Company monitors the recoverability of the carrying value of its long-lived assets. An
impairment charge is recognized when the expected net undiscounted future cash flows from an
assets use including any proceeds from disposition are less than the assets carrying value and
the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of by sale are stated at
the lower of their fair values or carrying amounts and depreciation is no longer recognized. Cost in Excess of Net Assets Acquired At December31, 2007, the Company had $2098million of goodwill on its balance sheet. Of the
total, $716million related to the High Performance Metals segment, $1121million related to the
Flat-Rolled Products segment, and $261million related to the Engineered Products segment.
Goodwill increased $33million during 2007 as a result of the impact of foreign currency
translation on goodwill denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The
Company accounts for goodwill under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets FAS 142. Under FAS 142, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets are reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. The
impairment test for goodwill requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit that
has goodwill associated with its operations with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If this
comparison reflects impairment, then the loss would be measured as the excess of recorded goodwill
over its implied fair value. Implied fair value is the excess of the fair value of the reporting
unit over the fair value of all recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities. The evaluation of goodwill for possible impairment includes estimating the fair market value
of each of the reporting units which have goodwill associated with their operations using
discounted cash flow and multiples of cash earnings valuation techniques, plus valuation
comparisons to recent public sale transactions of similar businesses, if any. These valuation
methods require the Company to make estimates and assumptions regarding future operating results,
cash flows, changes in working capital and capital expenditures, selling prices, profitability, and
the cost of capital. Although the Company believes that the estimates and assumptions used were
reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. The Company performs
the required annual goodwill impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of each year. No
impairment of goodwill was determined to exist for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. Environmental Costs that mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination or extend the life, increase the
capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of property utilized in current operations are
capitalized. Other costs that relate to current operations or an existing condition caused by past
operations are expensed. Environmental liabilities are recorded when the Companys liability is
probable and the costs are reasonably estimable, but generally not later than the completion of the
feasibility study or the Companys recommendation of a remedy or commitment to an appropriate plan
of action. The accruals are reviewed periodically and, as investigations and remediations proceed,
adjustments of the accruals are made to reflect new information as appropriate. Accruals for losses
from environmental remediation obligations do not take into account the effects of inflation, and
anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value. The accruals are not reduced by
possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties, but do reflect allocations
among potentially responsible parties PRPs at Federal Superfund sites or similar state-managed
sites after an assessment is made of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their
obligations at such sites and after appropriate cost-sharing or other agreements are entered. The
measurement of environmental liabilities by the Company is based on currently available facts,
present laws and regulations, and current technology. Such estimates take into consideration the
Companys prior experience in site investigation and remediation, the data concerning cleanup costs
available from other companies and regulatory authorities, and the professional judgment of the
Companys environmental experts in consultation with outside environmental specialists, when
necessary. 55 Table of Contents Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging As part of its risk management strategy, the Company, from time-to-time, utilizes derivative
financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in raw material prices, energy costs,
foreign currencies, and interest rates. The Company accounts for all of these contracts as hedges
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities FAS 133. In general, hedge effectiveness is determined by examining the
relationship between offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the item being
hedged, and the financial instrument being used for the hedge. Effectiveness is measured utilizing
regression analysis and other techniques to determine whether the change in the fair market value
or cash flows of the derivative exceeds the change in fair value or cash flow of the hedged item.
Calculated ineffectiveness, if any, is immediately recognized on the statement of income. For the
years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, calculated ineffectiveness was not material to the
results of operations. The Company sometimes uses futures and swap contracts to manage exposure to changes in prices
for forecasted purchases of raw materials, such as nickel, and natural gas. Generally under these
contracts, which are accounted for as cash flow hedges, the price of the item being hedged is fixed
at the time that the contract is entered into and the Company is obligated to make or receive a
payment equal to the net change between this fixed price and the market price at the date the
contract matures. Foreign currency exchange contracts are used, from time-to-time, to limit transactional
exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. The Company sometimes purchases foreign currency
forward contracts that permit it to sell specified amounts of foreign currencies expected to be
received from its export sales for pre-established U.S. dollar amounts at specified dates. The
forward contracts are denominated in the same foreign currencies in which export sales are
denominated. These contracts are designated as hedges of the variability in cash flows of a portion
of the forecasted future export sales transactions which otherwise would expose the Company to
foreign currency risk. In addition, the Company may also designate cash balances held in foreign
currencies as hedges of forecasted foreign currency transactions. The majority of the hedge contracts mature within one year. Changes in the fair value of these
contracts are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income lossin stockholders
equity until the hedged item is recognized in the statement of income. If a contract or portion of
a contract no longer qualifies as a hedge due to changes in forecasted quantities, the change in
fair value related to this ineffective portion is immediately recognized as income or expense in
the statement of income. The Company may enter into derivative interest rate contracts to maintain a reasonable balance
between fixed- and floating-rate debt. There were no unsettled derivative financial instruments
related to debt balances for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 or 2005, although previously
settled contracts remain a component of the recorded value of debt. See Note 3. Debt, for further
information. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of international operations are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end
exchange rates, while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the
period. The resulting net translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income lossin stockholders equity. Sales Recognition Sales are recognized when title passes or as services are rendered. Research and Development Company funded research and development costs were $140million in 2007, $96million in 2006, and
$84million in 2005 and were expensed as incurred. Customer funded research and development costs
were $05million in 2007 and in 2006, and $17million in 2005. Customer funded research and
development costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in accordance with
revenue recognition policies. Stock-based Compensation Effective January1, 2005, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123R, Share-Based Payment FAS 123R, using the modified prospective method in which effect
of the standard is recognized in the period of adoption and in
56 Table of Contents future periods. Under FAS 123R, companies are required to account for stock-based compensation
transactions, such as stock options, restricted stock, and potential payments under programs such
as the Companys Total Shareholder Return Program TSRP awards, using an approach in which the
fair value of an award is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as an expense over the
requisite service period. Compensation expense is adjusted for equity awards that do not vest
because service or performance conditions are not satisfied. However, compensation expense already
recognized is not adjusted if market conditions are not met, such as the Companys total
shareholder return performance relative to a peer group under the Companys TSRP awards, or for
stock options which expire out-of-the-money. Income Taxes The provision for, or benefit from, income taxes includes deferred taxes resulting from temporary
differences in income for financial and tax purposes using the liability method. Such temporary
differences result primarily from differences in the carrying value of assets and liabilities.
Future realization of deferred income tax assets requires sufficient taxable income within the
carryback, carryforward period available under tax law. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis whether, based on all available evidence, it is
probable that the deferred income tax assets are realizable. Valuation allowances are established
when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the deferred tax asset
will not be realized. The evaluation, as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, includes the consideration of all available evidence, both
positive and negative, regarding historical operating results including recent years with reported
losses, the estimated timing of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences,
estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, and
potential tax planning strategies which may be employed to prevent an operating loss or tax credit
carryforward from expiring unused. It is the Companys policy to classify interest and penalties recognized on underpayment of
income taxes as income tax expense. Net Income Per Common Share Basic and diluted net income per share are calculated by dividing the net income available to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted amounts assume the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive share equivalents
outstanding. The calculation of diluted net loss per share, if any, excludes the potentially
dilutive effect of dilutive share equivalents since the inclusion in the calculation of additional
shares in the net loss per share would result in a lower per share loss and therefore be
anti-dilutive. New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In the 2007 first quarter, as required, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB Staff Position FSP titled Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities FSP
PMMA. This FSP amends an AICPA Industry Audit guide and is applicable to all industries that
accrue for planned major maintenance activities. The FSP PMMA prohibits the use of the
accrue-in-advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities, which was the
policy the Company previously used to record planned plant outage costs on an interim basis within
a fiscal year, and also to record the costs of major equipment rebuilds which extend the life of
capital equipment. The FSP PMMA was effective as of the beginning of the Companys 2007 fiscal
year, with retrospective application to all prior periods presented. Under the FSP PMMA, the
Company reports results using the deferral method whereby major equipment rebuilds are capitalized
as costs are incurred and amortized to expense over the estimated useful lives, and planned plant
outage costs are fully recognized in the interim period of the outage. The adoption of the FSP PMMA
on January1, 2007, resulted in an increase to previously reported retained earnings of $103
million, net of related taxes. As required by the FSP PMMA, the financial statements have been
restated to reflect this FSP as if this standard had been applied to the earliest period presented.
As a result, net income for 2006 and 2005 increased $22million and $26million, respectively,
or approximately $002 per share for each year. Retained earnings at December31, 2004 increased
by $55million. In the 2007 first quarter, the Company also adopted FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48, an interpretation of FASB Statement No109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes recognition and measurement standards for a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position in
accordance with FIN 48 is a two step process. The first step is the determination of whether a tax
position should be recognized in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, the benefit of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is to be recognized only if we determine
that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the tax
authorities based upon the technical merits of the position. In step two, for those tax positions
which should be recognized, the measurement of a tax position is 57 Table of Contents determined as being the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being
realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 was effective for the beginning of ATIs 2007 fiscal
year, with adoption treated as a cumulative-effect type reduction to retained earnings of $56
million as of the beginning of 2007. In September2006, the FASB issued an amendment to its standards for defined benefit pension
and other postretirement benefit plans accounting. The new standard, Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans FAS 158, requires that the net funded position of the plans, as measured
by the difference between plan assets and the projected benefit obligation in the case of pension
plans, and by the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation in the case of other postretirement
benefit plans, be recognized as an asset or liability in the employers balance sheet. This change
was effective for year-end 2006, and is more fully discussed in Note 8. Pension Plans and Other
Postretirement Benefits. As required under the accounting rules which existed prior to adoption of
the new standard, the Company recognized an increase to stockholders equity of $3898million at
year-end 2006 primarily as a result of the improved funded position of the U.S. defined benefit
pension plan. The adoption of FAS 158 resulted in a reduction to stockholders equity of $3426
million, which was recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The net
effect of both of these adjustments was an increase in stockholders equity of $472million. In
addition, the new standard will require assets and benefits to be measured at the date of the
employers statement of financial position, which in our case is December31 of each year, rather
than our measurement date of November30, as currently permitted. This change will be effective for
the Companys year ending December31, 2008. In March2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No47, Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations FIN 47, an interpretation of FAS 143. FIN 47 clarifies that the term
conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FAS 143 refers to a legal obligation to
perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and ormethod of settlement are
conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. An entity is
required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation
if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated, even if conditional on a future
event. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December15, 2005,
and ATI adopted the standard in the 2005 fourth quarter, as required. The adoption of FIN 47
resulted in recognizing a charge of $20million, net of income taxes of $13million, and is
reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
See Note 14. Asset Retirement Obligations, for additional
information. Pending Accounting Pronouncements In September2006, the FASB issued FAS 157, Fair Value Measurements. This Standard defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair
value measurements. This statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or
permit fair value measurements, but does not require any new fair value measurements. The Standard
covers financial assets and liabilities, as well as any other assets and liabilities that are
carried at fair value on a recurring basis in financial statements. FAS 157 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November15, 2007 for financial assets and liabilities, and for fiscal years
beginning after November15, 2008 for other nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The Company does
not expect that the adoption of FAS 157 will have a material impact on its financial statements. In February2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No159 FAS
159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities. FAS 159 permits entities to
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. If the fair
value option is elected, unrealized gains and losses will be recognized in earnings at each
subsequent reporting date. FAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting FAS 159 but does not expect the adoption
to have a material impact on its financial statements. In December2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No160 FAS
160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. FAS 160 changes the
classification of noncontrolling minorityinterests on the balance sheet and the accounting for
and reporting of transactions between the reporting entity and holders of such noncontrolling
interests. Under the new standard, noncontrolling interests are considered equity and are to be
reported as an element of stockholders equity rather than within the mezzanine or liability
sections of the balance sheet. In addition, the current practice of reporting minority interest
expense or benefit also will change. Under the new standard, net income will encompass the total
income before minority interest expense. The income statement will include separate disclosure of
the attribution of income between the controlling and noncontrolling interests. Increases and
decreases in the noncontrolling ownership interest amount are to accounted for as equity
transactions. FAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008 and earlier
application is prohibited. Upon adoption, the balance sheet and the income statement will be recast
retrospectively for the presentation of noncontrolling interests. The other accounting provisions
of the statement are required to be adopted prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact
of 58 Table of Contents adopting FAS 160, including the reporting of the minority interest in our STAL joint venture,
will have on our financial statements. As of December31, 2007, other long-term liabilities
included $557million for minority interest in our STAL joint venture. Note 2. Inventories Inventory at December31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows

Inventories, before progress payments, determined on the last-in, first-out LIFO method
were $6515million at December31, 2007, and $5367million at December31, 2006. The remainder of
the inventory was determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO and average cost methods, and
these inventory values do not differ materially from current cost. The effect of using the LIFO
methodology to value inventory, rather than FIFO, decreased cost of sales in 2007 by $921million,
and increased cost of sales in 2006 and 2005 by $1970million and $458million, respectively. During 2007, 2006, and 2005, inventory usage resulted in liquidations of LIFO inventory
quantities. These inventories were carried at the lower costs prevailing in prior years as compared
with the cost of current manufacturing cost and purchases. The effect of these LIFO liquidations
was to decrease cost of sales by $352million in 2007, $25million in 2006 and $28million in
2005. Note 3. Debt Debt at December31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows

Includes fair value adjustments for interest rate swap contracts of $87million and $105
million for deferred gains on settled interest rate swap contracts at December31, 2007 and
2006, respectively. Interest expense was $308million in 2007, $383million in 2006, and $470million in 2005.
Interest expense was reduced by $98million, $45million, and $02million in 2007, 2006, and
2005, respectively, from interest capitalization on capital projects. Interest and commitment fees
paid were $429million in 2007, $476million in 2006, and $448million in 2005. Interest
payments in 2006 included $49million related to litigation settlements. Net interest expense
includes interest income of $260million in 2007, $150million in 2006, and $84million in 2005. Scheduled maturities of borrowings during the next five years are $209million in 2008, $114
million in 2009, $231million in 2010, $3114million in 2011 and $11million in 2012. The
promissory note for the JL asset acquisition bears interest at a floating rate capped at 6 payable in installments with a final maturity of July1, 2011, and is secured by the property,
plant and equipment acquired. In December2001, the Company issued $300million of 8375% Notes due December15, 2011, which
are registered under the Securities Act of 1933. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually, on
June15 and December15, and is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. These Notes
contain default provisions with respect to default for the following, among other conditions 59 Table of Contents nonpayment of interest on the Notes for 30days, default in payment of principal when due, or
failure to cure the breach of a covenant as provided in the Notes. Any violation of the default
provision could result in the requirement to immediately repay the borrowings. These Notes are
presented on the balance sheet net of unamortized issuance costs of $33million, which are being
amortized over the term of the Notes. The Company has deferred gains on settled interest rate swap contracts that are recognized as
reductions to interest expense over the remaining life of the Notes, which is approximately four
years. At December31, 2007, the deferred settlement gain was $87million, and recognition of a
portion of the deferred settlement gain decreased interest expense by $18million, $17million,
and $15million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, compared to
the fixed interest expense of the Notes. Effective July31, 2007, the Company replaced its then-existing $325million senior secured
domestic revolving credit facility with a new five-year $400million senior unsecured domestic
revolving credit facility. The unsecured facility includes a $200million sublimit for the
issuance of letters of credit. Under the terms of the unsecured facility, the Company may increase
the size of the credit facility by up to $100million without seeking the further approval of the
lending group. The unsecured facility requires the Company to maintain a leverage ratio
consolidated total indebtedness divided by consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and
depreciation and amortization of not greater than 325, and maintain an interest coverage ratio
consolidated earnings before interest and taxes divided by interest expense of not less than 20. Borrowings or letter of credit issuance under the unsecured facility bear interest at the
Companys option at either: 1the one-, two-, three- or six-month LIBOR rate plus a margin
ranging from 0625% to 125% depending upon the value of the leverage ratio as defined by the
unsecured facility agreement; or 2a base rate announced from time-to-time by the lending group
i.e., the Prime lending rate. In addition, the unsecured facility contains a facility fee of
015% to 030% depending upon the value of the leverage ratio, and a letter of credit issuance fee
of 0125%. The Companys overall borrowing costs under the unsecured facility are not affected by
changes in the Companys credit ratings. As of December31, 2007, there had been no borrowings made under the unsecured credit
facility, although a portion was used to support approximately $43million in letters of credit. In August2007, STAL, the Companys Chinese joint venture company in which ATI has a 60%
interest, entered into a five-year revolving credit facility with a group of banks. Under the
credit facility, STAL may borrow up to 741million renminbi approximately $99million based on
December2007 exchange rates at an interest rate equal to 90% of the applicable lending rate
published by the Peoples Bank of China. The credit facility is supported solely by STALs
financial capability without any guarantees from the joint venture partners, and is intended to be
utilized in the future for the expansion of STALs operations, which are located in Shanghai,
China. The credit facility requires STAL to maintain a minimum level of shareholders equity, and
certain financial ratios. As of December31, 2007, there had been no borrowings made under the
STAL credit facility. STAL had approximately $21million in letters of credit outstanding as of December31, 2007.
These letters of credit are supported solely by STALs financial capability without any guarantees
from the joint venture partners. The Companys subsidiaries also maintain other credit agreements with various foreign banks,
which provide for borrowings of up to approximately $77million, including capacity for $17million
of short-term financing of trade accounts payable at the STAL joint venture in China. At December
31, 2007, the Company had approximately $59million of available borrowing capacity under these
foreign credit agreements. These agreements provide for annual facility fees of up to 020%. The
weighted average interest rate of foreign credit agreements in 2007 was 46%. The Company has no off-balance sheet financing relationships with variable interest entities,
structured finance entities, or any other unconsolidated entities. At December31, 2007, the
Company had not guaranteed any third-party indebtedness. 60 Table of Contents Note 4. Supplemental Financial Statement Information Cash and cash equivalents at December31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows

Includes fair value adjustments for settled interest rate swap contracts of $87million at
December31, 2007, and $105million at December31, 2006. The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating the fair value of
its financial instruments Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount on the balance sheet approximates fair value. Short-term and long-term debt: The fair values of the Allegheny Technologies 8375% Notes and
the Allegheny Ludlum 695% debentures were based on quoted market prices. The carrying amounts of
the other short-term and long-term debt approximate fair value. Accounts receivable are presented net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of $63million at
December31, 2007, and $57million at December31, 2006. During 2007, the Company recognized
expense of $10million to increase the reserve for doubtful accounts and wrote off $04million of
uncollectible accounts, which decreased the reserve. During 2006, the Company wrote off $17
million of uncollectible accounts, which decreased the reserve, and also reduced expense by $07
million due to decreasing the reserve for doubtful accounts. During 2005, the Company recognized
expense of $17million to increase the reserve for doubtful accounts and wrote off $20million of
uncollectible accounts, which reduced the reserve. Accrued liabilities included salaries and wages of $975million and $831million at December
31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Property, plant and equipment at December31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows

preferences as shall be designated by the Board of Directors. At December31, 2007, there were no
shares of preferred stock issued. Common Stock On November1, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of $500
million. As of December31, 2007, 674,800 shares had been purchased in open market transactions
under this program at a cost of $612million. Per share amounts for 2007 reflect the effect of
the shares repurchased on a weighted average basis for the periods presented. Share-based Compensation The Company sponsors three principal share-based incentive compensation programs. During 2007, the
Company adopted the Allegheny Technologies Incorporated 2007 Incentive Plan the Incentive Plan.
Awards earned under share-based incentive compensation programs are generally paid with shares held
in treasury, if sufficient treasury shares are held, and any additional required share payments are
made with newly issued shares. At December31, 2007, approximately 25million shares of common
stock were available for future awards under the Incentive Plan. The general terms of each
arrangement granted under the Incentive Plan, and predecessor plans, the method of estimating fair
value for each arrangement, and award activity is reported below. Stock option awards: The Company has not granted any stock options, other than grants to
non-employee directors, since 2003. During 2006, the Company granted options to purchase 9,000
shares of Common Stock to non-employee directors, which vested in one year. In December2006, the
Companys Board of Directors determined that no new director options would be granted. 62 Table of Contents As of December31, 2007, there were no unvested stock option awards. Options granted to
employees vested in one-third increments over three years, based on term of service. Options have
been granted at not less than market prices on the dates of grant. Options granted under the
Incentive Plan have a maximum term of 10years. Compensation expense under FAS 123R is recognized
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the entire grant. Compensation expense related
to stock option awards was $03million in 2006 and $26million in 2005. The fair values of prior
years option grants were estimated on the dates of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton
option-pricing model, with the following weighted average assumptions

Nonvested stock awards: Awards of nonvested stock are granted with either performance and/or
service conditions. In certain grants, nonvested shares participate in cash dividends during the
restriction period. In other grants, dividends are paid in the form of additional shares of
nonvested stock, subject to the same vesting conditions and dividend treatment as the underlying
shares. The fair value of nonvested stock awards is measured based on the stock price at the grant
date, adjusted for non-participating dividends, as applicable, based on the current dividend rate.
For nonvested stock awards in 2007, 2006, and 2005, one-half of the nonvested stock performance
shares vests only on the attainment of an income target, measured over a cumulative three-year
period. The remaining nonvested stock vests over a service period of five years, with accelerated
vesting to three years if the performance shares vesting criterion is attained. Expense for each
of these awards is recognized based on estimates of attaining the performance criterion. As of
December31, 2007, the income statement metrics for the 2007 and 2006 awards were expected to be
attained for the performance shares, and expense for both portions of the awards was recognized on
a straight line basis based on a three-year vesting assumption. The performance metric for the 2005
award, comprising 152,070 shares, including dividend shares, was met as of December31, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Compensation expense related to all nonvested stock awards was $76million in 2007, $42
million in 2006 and $26million in 2005. Approximately $98million of unrecognized fair value
compensation expense relating to nonvested stock awards is expected to be recognized through 2009
based on estimates of attaining performance vesting criteria.

Total shareholder return incentive compensation program TSRP awards: Awards under the TSRP
are granted at a target number of shares, and vest based on the measured return of the Companys
stock price and dividend performance at the end of three-year periods compared to the stock price
and dividend performance of a group of industry peers. In 2007, the Company initiated a 2007-2009
TSRP, with 107,347 shares as the target award level. The actual number of shares awarded may range
from a minimum of zero to a maximum of three times target. Fair values for the TSRP awards were
estimated using Monte Carlo simulations of stock price correlation, projected dividend yields and
other variables over three-year time horizons matching the TSRP performance periods. Compensation
expense was $102million in 2007, $57million in 2006 and $42million in 2005 for the fair value
of TSRP awards. The estimated fair value of each TSRP award, including the projected shares to be awarded, and
future compensation expense to be recognized for TSRP awards, including estimated forfeitures, was

An award was earned for the 2005-2007 TSRP performance period based on the Companys stock
price performance for the three-year period ended December31, 2007, which resulted in the issuance
of 472,478 shares of stock to participants in the 2008 first quarter. Undistributed Earnings of Investees Stockholders equity includes undistributed earnings of investees accounted for under the equity
method of accounting of approximately $35million at December31, 2007. Stockholders Rights Plan Under the Companys stockholder rights plan, each share of Allegheny Technologies common stock is
accompanied by one right to purchase two one-hundredths of a share of preferred stock for $100.
Each two one-hundredths of a share of preferred stock would be entitled to dividends and to vote on
an equivalent basis with one share of common stock. The rights are neither exercisable nor
separately transferable from shares of common stock unless a party acquires or effects a tender
offer for more than 15% of Allegheny Technologies common stock. If a party acquired more than 15%
of the Allegheny Technologies common stock or acquired the Company in a business combination, each
right other than those held by the acquiring party would entitle the holder to purchase common
stock or preferred stock at a substantial discount. The rights are scheduled to expire on March12,
2008, and the Companys Board of Directors can amend certain provisions of the plan or redeem the
rights at any time prior to their becoming exercisable. 64 Table of Contents Note 7. Income Taxes Income tax provision benefitwas as follows

Results of operations for 2007 benefited from a $231million reduction of a deferred tax
valuation allowance with respect to certain state tax credits and operating losses expected to be
realized in future periods. Results of operations for 2005 included an income tax benefit of $533
million principally caused by the reversal of the remaining valuation allowance for the Companys
U.S. Federal net deferred tax assets, partially offset by accruals for U.S. Federal, foreign and
state income taxes. From the 2003 fourth quarter through the third quarter of 2005, the Company
maintained a valuation allowance for a major portion of its U.S. Federal deferred tax assets in
accordance with FAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, due to uncertainty regarding full
utilization of its net deferred tax asset, including the 2003 and 2004 unutilized U.S. Federal net
operating losses of approximately $140million. In the 2003 fourth quarter, the Company recorded a
$1385million valuation allowance for the majority of its net deferred tax asset, based upon the
results of its quarterly evaluation concerning the estimated probability that the net deferred tax
asset would be realizable in light of the Companys history of annual reported losses in the years
2001 through 2003. In 2005, the Company generated taxable income which exceeded the 2003 and 2004
net operating losses, allowing full realization of these tax benefits. This realization of tax
benefits, together with the Companys improved profitability, allowed the Company to reverse the
remaining valuation allowance for U.S. Federal deferred taxes in the 2005 fourth quarter. The following is a reconciliation of income taxes computed at the statutory U.S. Federal
income tax rate to the actual effective income tax provision benefit

In general, the Company is responsible for filing consolidated U.S. Federal, foreign and
combined, unitary or separate state income tax returns. The Company is responsible for paying the
taxes relating to such returns, including any subsequent adjustments resulting from the
redetermination of such tax liability by the applicable taxing authorities. No provision has been
made for U.S. Federal, state or additional foreign taxes related to undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries which have been permanently re-invested. Income before income taxes for the Companys U.S. and non-U.S. operations was as follows

Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and
expense for financial and income tax reporting purposes, and differences between the fair value of
assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases for financial reporting
purposes and their corresponding tax bases. Deferred income taxes represent future tax benefits or
costs to be recognized when those temporary differences reverse. The categories of assets and
liabilities that have resulted in differences in the timing of the recognition of income and
expense at December31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows

The Company had $86million and $364million in deferred tax asset valuation allowances at
December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to state deferred tax assets. The valuation
allowance at December31, 2007 includes $57million for state net operating loss tax carryforwards
and $29million for state temporary differences since the Company has concluded, based on current
state tax laws, that it is more likely than not that these tax benefits would not be realized. For
these state net operating loss tax carryforwards, expiration will generally occur in 20years and
utilization of the tax benefit is limited to $3million per year or 125% of apportioned income,
which ever is greater. In the 2007 first quarter, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48, an interpretation of FASB Statement No109, Accounting
for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes recognition and measurement standards for a tax position taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48
is a two step process. The first step is the determination of whether a tax position should be
recognized in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, the benefit of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return is to be recognized only if the Company determines that it is
more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the tax
authorities based upon the technical merits of the position. In step two, for those tax positions
which should be recognized, the measurement of a tax position is determined as being the largest
amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN
48 was effective for the beginning of ATIs 2007 fiscal year, with adoption treated as a cumulative
effect type reduction to retained earnings. As a result of implementing FIN 48, the Company
recognized a $194million increase in the long-term liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and a
$138million increase in deferred tax assets for tax positions for which the ultimate
deductibility is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such
deductibility. Interest and penalties recognized at the FIN 48 adoption date were $35million.
Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the
disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but
would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. The net result
of these recognized assets and liabilities was a reduction to beginning retained earnings of $56 66 Table of Contents million. Including liabilities recognized in the FIN 48 adoption, the Companys total
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits at January1, 2007 were $263million. Changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits following FIN 48 adoption for the year
ended December31, 2007 were as follows

For the year ended December31, 2007, the Companys income tax provision included $118
million of expense related to uncertain tax positions, including $19million related to interest
and penalties, which increased the long-term liability to $381million which included $54million
of potential interest and penalties. Including tax positions for which the Company determined that the tax position would not meet
the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold upon examination by the tax authorities based upon
the technical merits of the position, the total estimated unrecognized tax benefit that, if
recognized, would affect our effective tax rate was approximately $20million. At this time, the
Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $2million of the estimated
unrecognized tax benefits as of December31, 2007 will be recognized within the next twelve months
based on the expiration of statutory review periods. The Company, and/or one of its subsidiaries, files income tax returns in the U.S. Federal
jurisdiction and in various state and foreign jurisdictions. A summary of tax years that remain

2005 67 Table of Contents Note 8. Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits The Company has defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans covering substantially all
employees. Benefits under the defined benefit pension plans are generally based on years of service
and/or final average pay. The Company funds the U.S. pension plans in accordance with the
requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the Internal
Revenue Code. The Company also sponsors several postretirement benefit plans covering certain salaried and
hourly employees. The plans provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees.
In most plans, Company contributions towards premiums are capped based on the cost as of a certain
date, thereby creating a defined contribution. For the non-collectively bargained plans, the
Company maintains the right to amend or terminate the plans at its discretion. Components of pension expense for the Companys defined benefit plans and components of other

assumptions. 68 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the funded status for the Companys pension and postretirement benefit

2006 includes a $56million noncurrent liability for the U.S. qualified defined benefit
plan, representing the difference between the projected benefit obligation of the plan and the
fair value of plan assets at the plan measurement date, and a $302million noncurrent
liability related to U.S. nonqualified defined benefit plans, which are not funded. As discussed in Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans FAS 158, as of fiscal year-end 2006. FAS 158 requires
that the net funded position of the plans, as measured by the projected benefit obligation PBO
in the case of pension plans, and by the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation APBO in
the case of other postretirement benefit plans, be recognized as an asset or liability in the
employers balance sheet. In addition, the new standard will require assets and benefits to be
measured at the date of the Companys statement of financial position, which is December31, rather
than the Companys measurement date of November30, as currently permitted. This change will be
effective for the Companys year ending December31, 2008. Prior to the adoption of FAS 158, the funded status of pension plans was measured by the
difference between plan assets and the accumulated benefit obligation ABO. At the November30,
2006 measurement date, the Companys U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan was overfunded on
an ABO basis, and the Company reversed the previously-recorded minimum pension liability and
accumulated other comprehensive income lossassociated with this plan when it had been in an ABO
underfunded position, recorded a prepaid pension cost asset of $5699million, and increased
stockholders equity by $3898million, net of related deferred tax effects. However, on a PBO
basis, which is the funded status measure required by FAS 158, the Companys U.S. qualified defined
benefit pension plan was underfunded by $56million at the 2006 measurement date. For the
Companys U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, the adoption of FAS 158 in 2006 eliminated
the $5699million prepaid pension cost, established a $56million noncurrent liability, and
reduced stockholders equity by $3453million, net of related deferred tax effects. The Company
sponsors other non-qualified defined benefit pension plans in the U.S., a defined benefit pension
plan in the U.K., and also sponsors several postretirement benefit plans. Including these other
pension and postretirement benefit plans, the aggregate effect of adopting FAS 158 in 2006 reduced
stockholders equity by $3426million, net of related deferred tax effects, as a component of
accumulated other 69 Table of Contents comprehensive income loss. The net effect of these adjustments was an increase in
stockholders equity of $472million at December31, 2006. These charges and adjustments did not
affect the Companys results of operations and do not have a cash impact. In the first quarter 2007, the Company entered into new labor agreements with the United
Steelworkers represented employees at ATI Allegheny Ludlum and at ATI Allvacs Albany, OR Oremet
operations. The new agreements expire on June30, 2011. The ATI Allegheny Ludlum agreement
provides for profit sharing above specified minimum pre-tax annual profit for the Companys
Flat-Rolled Products business segment, with any profit sharing payments to be contributed to a new,
independently administered VEBA Voluntary Employee Benefit Association trust. The Company
expects to contribute $10million to this VEBA in 2008. Benefits changes as a result of the new
labor agreements increased the pension and other postretirement obligations by $75million, and
$457million, respectively. Changes to accumulated other comprehensive income lossrelated to pension and other
postretirement benefit plans in 2007, net of related deferred tax effects, were as follows

The plan invests in a diversified portfolio consisting of an array of asset classes that
attempts to maximize returns while minimizing volatility. These asset classes include U.S. domestic
equities, developed market equities, emerging market equities, private equity, global high quality
and high yield fixed income, and real estate. The Company continually monitors the investment
results of these asset classes and its fund managers, and explores other potential asset classes
for possible future investment. The plan assets for the defined benefit pension plan at December31, 2007 and 2006 included
13million shares of Allegheny Technologies Incorporated common stock with a fair value of $1123
million and $1179million, respectively. Dividends of $07million and $06million were received
by the plan in 2007 and 2006, respectively, on the Allegheny Technologies common stock held by the
plan. The Company is not required to make cash contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension
plan for 2008 and, based upon current regulations and actuarial studies, does not expect to be
required to make cash contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan for at least the next
several years. However, the Company may elect, depending upon the investment performance of the
pension plan assets and other factors, to make voluntary cash contributions to this pension plan in
the future. For 2008, the Company expects to fund benefits of approximately $4million for its U.S.
nonqualified benefit pension plans, and fund contributions of approximately $2million to its U.K.
defined benefit plan. The Company contributes on behalf of certain of union employees to a pension
plan, which is administered by the USW and funded pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement.
Pension expense and contributions to this plan were $13million in 2007, $11million in 2006, and
$08million in 2005. In accordance with labor agreements, the Company funds certain retiree health care benefits
for ATI Allegheny Ludlum using plan assets held in an existing Company-administered VEBA trust.
During 2007, 2006, and 2005, the Company was able to fund $308million, $281million, and $247
million, respectively, of retiree medical costs using the assets of the Company-administered VEBA
trust. The Company may continue to fund certain retiree medical benefits utilizing the plan assets
held in the Company-administered VEBA trust. The value of the assets held in this VEBA was
approximately $76million as of the November30, 2007 measurement date. For 2008, the Company
expects to fund $19million of expected benefit payments not paid by the Company-administered VEBA
trust. Pension costs for defined contribution plans were $204million in 2007, $158million in
2006, and $150million in 2005. Company contributions to the defined contribution plans are funded
with cash. The following table summarizes expected benefit payments from the Companys various pension
and other postretirement benefit plans through 2017, and also includes estimated Medicare PartD

aComprises assets held by the Companys European Treasury Center operation. Note 10. Restructuring Costs and Other Charges Restructuring Costs There were no restructuring costs or curtailment gains recorded for the years ended December31,
2007 or 2006. For the year ended December31, 2005, the Company recorded net charges of $239
million, due primarily to asset impairments, which are presented as restructuring costs in the
consolidated statement of income. The charges were comprised of $243million of asset impairment
charges, and $15million of related environmental costs, net of a $19million reserve reversal
for previously accrued lease termination costs. Based on an analysis of existing and projected business conditions, at the 2005year-end date,
the Company decided to indefinitely idle the West Leechburg, PA finishing facility in the Companys
Flat-Rolled Products segment. This action resulted in an asset impairment charge of $158million,
representing the excess of the facilitys net book value over estimated fair value based on
expected future cash flows. In conjunction with the indefinite idling, a liability for $15million
in environmental exit costs was recognized. Additionally, based on revised fair value cash flow
estimates, the Company recorded $85million of asset impairment charges associated with previously
idled assets in the Flat-Rolled Products segment at the Washington Flat-Roll coil facility located
in Washington, PA, and the stainless steel plate facility located in Massillon, OH, partially
offset by a $19million reversal of lease termination charges. Reserves for restructuring charges recorded in prior years involving future payments were
approximately $2million at December31, 2007. Other Gains and Charges In 2007, the Company recorded $102million in other charges primarily related to closed companies,
including $54million for environmental costs, $29million for legal matters, and $19million
for real estate and other costs. In 2006, the Company recorded $152million in other charges,
including $71million for legal matters and $81million for environmental and other closed
company costs. In 2005, the Company recorded $338million in other charges, including $268
million for legal matters and $70million for environmental and other closed company costs. 74 Table of Contents Note 11. Financial Information for Subsidiary Guarantors The payment obligations under the $150million 695% debentures due 2025 issued by Allegheny Ludlum

Weighted average shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options which were antidilutive,
and thus not included in the calculation, were 05million in 2005. Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies Rental expense under operating leases was $191million in 2007, $203million in 2006, and $210
million in 2005. Future minimum rental commitments under operating leases with non-cancelable terms
of more than one year at December31, 2007, were as follows: $169million in 2008, $149million
in 2009, $136million in 2010, $129million in 2011, $48million in 2012 and $36million
thereafter. Future minimum payments under capital leases for long-lived assets are $04million in
2008, $02million in 2009, $02million in 2010, and $01million in 2011. Commitments for
expenditures on property, plant and equipment at December31, 2007 were approximately $145million. The Company is subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and
regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants, and disposal of wastes, and which may require
that it investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites
associated with past and present operations. The Company could incur substantial cleanup costs,
fines, and civil or criminal sanctions, third party property damage or personal injury claims as a
result of violations or liabilities under these laws or noncompliance with environmental permits
required at its facilities. The Company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation
of a number of its current and former sites, as well as third party sites. Environmental liabilities are recorded when the Companys liability is probable and the costs
are reasonably estimable. In many cases, however, the Company is not able to determine whether it
is liable or, if liability is probable, to reasonably estimate the loss or range of loss. Estimates
of the Companys liability remain subject to additional uncertainties, including the nature and
extent of site contamination, available remediation alternatives, the extent of corrective actions
that may be required, and the number, participation, and financial condition of other potentially
responsible parties PRPs. The Company expects that it will adjust its accruals to reflect new
information as appropriate. Future adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the
Companys results of operations in a given period, but the Company cannot reliably predict the
amounts of such future adjustments. Based on currently available information, the Company does not believe that there is a
reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding the amount already accrued for any of the sites with
which the Company is currently associated either individually or in the aggregate will be an
amount that would be material to a decision to buy or sell the Companys securities. Future
developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters, however,
could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. 80 Table of Contents At December31, 2007, the Companys reserves for environmental remediation obligations totaled
approximately $20million, of which $8million were included in other current liabilities. The
reserve includes estimated probable future costs of $7million for federal Superfund and comparable
state-managed sites; $7million for formerly owned or operated sites for which the Company has
remediation or indemnification obligations; $4million for owned or controlled sites at which
Company operations have been discontinued; and $2million for sites utilized by the Company in its
ongoing operations. The Company continues to evaluate whether it may be able to recover a portion
of future costs for environmental liabilities from third parties. The timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors that vary by site. The Company
expects that it will expend present accruals over many years and that remediation of all sites with
which it has been identified will be completed within thirty years. In June2003, the San Diego Unified Port District Port District commenced an action in
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against TDY Industries, Inc. TDY
asserting federal, state and common law claims related to alleged environmental contamination on
property located in San Diego and formerly leased by TDY. The complaint seeks unspecified damages
and a declaratory judgment as to TDYs liability for contamination on the property. TDY asserted a
counterclaim as well as claims against neighboring property owners and former and current operators
related to the environmental condition of the San Diego facility. The San Diego International
Airport Airport, the current operator of the San Diego Property, asserted a cross claim against
TDY alleging federal, state and common law claims relating to the alleged environmental
contamination and seeking losses relating to the Airports alleged inability to redevelop the
property. In December2006, General Dynamics Corporation, a former neighboring property operator,
commenced a separate but related action against TDY. General Dynamics alleges federal claims
relating to alleged environmental contamination emanating from the San Diego property that has
allegedly impacted General Dynamics property. The parties finalized a settlement of these matters
in the second quarter 2007. Separately, the Port District requested that the California Department of Toxic Substances
Control evaluate whether the San Diego property is regulated as a hazardous waste transportation,
storage, or disposal facility under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and similar state
laws. The Company will close four solid waste management units at the facility, in connection with
other work that is being done at the Site. TDY has conducted an environmental assessment of the San Diego facility pursuant to an October
2004 Order from the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board Regional Board. TDY will
perform remediation activities to address various areas of the Site. At December31, 2007, the
Company had adequate reserves for these matters. While the outcome of these environmental matters cannot be predicted with certainty, an
adverse resolution of the matters relating to the San Diego facility could have a material adverse
affect on the Companys results of operations and financial condition. TDY and another wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, among others, have been identified by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPAas PRPs at the Li Tungsten Superfund Site in Glen
Cove, New York. The Company believes that most of the contamination at the site resulted from work
done while the U.S. Government either owned or controlled operations at the site, or from processes
done for various governmental agencies, and that the U.S. Government is liable for a substantial
portion of the remediation costs at the site. In November2000, TDY filed a cost recovery and
contribution action against the U.S. Government. In March2003, the Court ordered the parties to
the action to fund a portion of the remediation costs at the site. In July2004, TDY, the U.S.
Government and the EPA entered into an Interim Agreement, under which the U.S. Government funded
$209million and TDY funded $1million of the remediation costs at the site. In November2005, TDY
sued other PRPs at the site seeking contribution to the response costs that have been and will
continue to be incurred at the site. TDY, the other PRPs and the U.S. Government reached a
resolution of this matter and a consent judgment was entered by the court in November2007. Under
the consent judgment, TDY will complete the remediation of the remaining portions of the site and
will receive contribution from other PRPs. Based on information presently available, the Company
believes its reserves on this matter are adequate. An adverse resolution of this matter could have
a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Since 1990, TDY has been operating under a Corrective Action Order from the EPA for a facility
that TDY owns and formerly operated in Hartville, Ohio. TDY commenced implementation of additional
remediation activities in 2007. The Company believes its reserves for the continued operation of
the interim system and for costs it expects to incur for the additional remediation activities are
adequate. A number of other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against the
Company relating to the conduct of its currently and formerly owned businesses, including those
pertaining to product liability, patent infringement, commercial 81 Table of Contents government contract work, employment, employee benefits, taxes, environmental, health and
safety and occupational disease, and stockholder matters. While the outcome of litigation cannot be
predicted with certainty, and some of these lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be determined
adversely to the Company, management does not believe that the disposition of any such pending
matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or
liquidity, although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could
have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations for that period. Note 14. Asset Retirement Obligations The Company maintains reserves where a legal obligation exists to perform an asset retirement
activity and the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. These asset retirement
obligations ARO include liabilities where the timing and ormethod of settlement may be
conditional on a future event, that may or may not be within the control of the entity. In the 2005
fourth quarter, the Company recognized $33million of liabilities for estimable conditional AROs
as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. At December31, 2007, the Company had
recognized AROs of $60million related to landfill closures and conditional AROs associated with
manufacturing activities using what may be characterized as potentially hazardous materials. Estimates of AROs are evaluated annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if material
new information becomes known. Accounting for asset retirement obligations requires significant
estimation and in certain cases, the Company has determined that an ARO exists, but the amount of
the obligation is not reasonably estimable. The Company may determine that additional AROs are
required to be recognized as new information becomes available. Changes in asset retirement obligations for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 were as

Item 5. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the Companys disclosure
controls and procedures as of December31, 2007, and they concluded that these controls and
procedures are effective. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule13a-15f 
and 15d-15f promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or
under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and
effected by the companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
includes those policies and procedures that Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving
financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial
reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in
judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting
can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations,
there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by
internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features
of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards
to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2007. In making this assessment, the Companys management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the Treadway
Commissions Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, management has concluded that, as of December31, 2007, the Companys
internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial
statements included in this Annual Report issued an attestation report on the Companys internal
control over financial reporting. Managements Certifications The certifications of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required by
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are included as Exhibits 31 and 32 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In
addition, in 2007 the Companys Chief Executive Officer provided to the New York Stock Exchange the
annual CEO certification pursuant to Section303A regarding the Companys compliance with the New
York Stock Exchanges corporate governance listing standards. 83 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Allegheny Technologies Incorporated We have audited Allegheny Technologies Incorporateds internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria.
Allegheny Technologies Incorporateds management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Allegheny Technologies Incorporated maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on the COSO
criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Allegheny Technologies
Incorporated as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31,
2007 and our report dated February21, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ Ernst Young LLP Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
