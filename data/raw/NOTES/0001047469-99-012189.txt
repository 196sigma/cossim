REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
LJL BioSystems, Inc.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity deficit and of
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
LJL BioSystems, Inc. and its subsidiary at December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
THE COMPANY
LJL BioSystems, Inc. the Company was incorporated in Delaware on January
19, 1993 and is the surviving corporation of three commonly controlled
companies, two of which were merged into the third, the Company, on January 1,
1994. Both of these predecessor entities and the Company were all formed and
wholly owned by the Company two S corporation stockholders. In March 1998, the
Company established a wholly owned subsidiary, LJL BioSystems, Ltd. in the
United Kingdom. The Company designs, produces, and markets to pharmaceutical and
biotechnology firms products and services that accelerate and enhance the drug
discovery process. The Company proprietary technology platform is designed to
address many of the limitations associated with current products for the HTS
market, allowing its customers to expedite the identification and optimization
of compounds for development into new medicines. The Company operates in one
business segment.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
In April 1998, the Company completed an initial public offering of 2,088,000
shares of its Common Stock, raising net cash proceeds of $128 million. In
connection with the offering, all outstanding shares of mandatorily redeemable
convertible preferred stock were converted into 3,621,503 shares of the
Company Common Stock.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenues from product sales are generally recognized upon shipment.
Development agreements are performed on a best efforts basis and revenues are
recognized based on work performed using the percentage-of-completion method,
completion being measured using costs incurred to total estimated costs at
completion. Amounts received in advance of services rendered are recorded as
customer deposits. Research and development expenses under development
agreements were $316,000 and $1,663,000 in 1997 and 1996, respectively.
CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments, principally money
market accounts and marketable debt securities, with maturities of three months
or less at the time of purchase.
37
LJL BIOSYSTEMS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
NOTE 1 THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: CONTINUED
INVESTMENTS
The Company short and long-term investments consist of marketable
securities classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are
carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax,
included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity
deficit. Gains and losses on securities sold are based on the specific
identification method and are included in the results of operations.
Fair values of marketable securities are based on quoted market values at
December 31, 1998. At December 31, 1998, the difference between the fair value
and amortized cost of marketable securities was not significant. As of December
31, 1998, marketable securities consisted of U.S. government securities and
corporate securities maturing within eighteen months or less.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130
SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, during 1998. Under SFAS 130, the
Company is required to display comprehensive income and its components as part
of the Company consolidated financial statements. The measurement and
presentation of net income loss did not change. Comprehensive income is
comprised of net income loss and other comprehensive income. Other
comprehensive income includes certain changes in the equity of the Company that
are excluded from net income loss. Specifically, SFAS 130 requires unrealized
gains and losses on the Company available-for-sale securities and foreign
currency translation adjustments, which otherwise would have been reported
separately in stockholders' equity deficit, to be included in accumulated
other comprehensive income. Comprehensive income for the years ended December
31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 has been reflected in the Consolidated Statement of
Stockholders' Equity Deficit.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash, cash equivalents, marketable
securities, a loan receivable from a related party and accounts receivable. The
Company deposits cash with high credit quality financial institutions. The
Company cash equivalents and marketable securities are primarily invested in
federal government agency obligations and corporate securities that have various
maturities during 1999 and 2000. The Company has issued a loan to an executive
officer as part of the terms of his employment agreement. The loan is secured by
the executive home and shares of the Company Common Stock.
The Company accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from
customers located in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Japan. Generally, the
Company requires no collateral on trade receivables. The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and provides
for expected losses; however, such amounts have not been significant. At
December 31, 1998, amounts due from one customer represented 25% of gross trade
receivables and amounts due from four other customers each represented 13% of
gross trade receivables. At December 31, 1997, amounts due from one customer
represented 100% of gross trade receivables. As a percentage of total revenues,
product sales
38

and revenues recognized under development agreements from individual customers
in excess of 10% of total revenues were as follows:

INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined using the first-in,
first-out method, or market.
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS
Software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of
technological feasibility are capitalized in accordance with Statement of
Financial Standards No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be
Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. Amortization of capitalized software
development costs is the greater of the amount computed using a the ratio of
current revenues to the total of current and anticipated future revenues or b
the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the product. No
amounts have been capitalized to date.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization
are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets, generally ranging from three to five years, or the lease term of the
respective assets. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company identifies and records impairment losses on long-lived assets
when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. No
such events have occurred with respect to the Company long-lived assets, which
consist primarily of property and equipment and leasehold improvements.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist of costs
incurred for internally funded research and development activities and
development agreements. These amounts include direct costs and research-related
overhead expenses.
INCOME TAXES
Prior to June 6, 1997, the Company elected to be treated as an S corporation
for federal and California income tax purposes. As a result, little or no
federal or state income taxes were payable at the corporate level. Rather, the
Company stockholders included their respective portions of the Company
39
LJL BIOSYSTEMS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
NOTE 1 THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: CONTINUED
taxable income in their individual income tax returns. On June 6, 1997, in
connection with the preferred stock financing, the Company became subject to the
C corporation provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, any earnings
after this date will be taxed at federal and state corporate income tax rates.
Upon termination of the Company S corporation status, the S corporation
accumulated deficit of $742,000 was transferred to additional paid-in capital.
The Company uses the asset and liability approach for accounting for income
taxes which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for
the expected future tax consequences of events recognized in the Company
consolidated financial statements or income tax returns. Deferred tax assets are
recognized, net of any valuation allowance, for deductible temporary
differences, net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards when their
realization is considered more likely than not. Deferred tax expense represents
the change in the deferred tax asset and liability balances.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The Company UK subsidiary uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the
end-of-period exchange rates except for property and equipment, which is
translated at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are translated at
average exchange rates in effect during each period. Gains or losses from
foreign currency transactions are included in net income loss and were not
material.
SEGMENT REPORTING
In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
131 SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information. SFAS 131 requires use of the management approach, which
designates the internal organization that is used by management for making
operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company
reportable segments. SFAS 131 also requires disclosures about products and
services, geographic areas, and major customers. The adoption of SFAS 131 did

December 31, 1998, 98% of the Company total assets were held domestically and
the Company earned 91% of its fiscal 1998 revenues from domestic customers.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has adopted the pro forma disclosure requirements of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. As permitted, the Company continues to recognize
stock-based compensation under the intrinsic value method of accounting as
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. The pro forma effects
of applying SFAS 123 are shown in Note 7 to the consolidated financial
statements.
BASIC AND DILUTED NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,
Earnings per Share, during the year ended December 31, 1997 and retroactively
restated all prior periods. Basic earnings per share is computed using the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and
potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares
consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon conversion of outstanding
convertible preferred stock using the if-

converted method and shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and
warrants using the treasury stock method. Potential common shares are excluded
from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive, as was the case for the
years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997. For the years ended December 31, 1998
and 1997, the net loss available to common stockholders includes $254,000 and
$636,000, respectively, to reflect accretion of the mandatorily redeemable
convertible preferred stock redemption value.
PRO FORMA BASIC AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER SHARE
Pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share for the year ended December
31, 1998 is computed using the net loss and the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period adjusted for the assumed conversion
as of January 1, 1998 of all outstanding shares of mandatorily redeemable
convertible preferred stock into 3,621,503 shares of Common Stock.

NOTE 3 LONG-TERM DEBT:
In September 1995, September 1996 and June 1997, the Company entered into
equipment loan agreements with a bank related to the purchase of equipment and
software. The loans, which were secured by the related equipment and software
and by personal guarantees by the Company stockholders, bore interest at
1020% to 1185% per annum and were repaid in full in March 1998.
In February 1998, the Company entered into a $1,300,000 master equipment
line of credit financing agreement with a leasing company. The line of credit,
which is secured by the related equipment and software, is due and payable in
monthly installments over four years, bears interest at 121% to 122% per annum
and, as amended, expires on July 31, 1999. At December 31, 1998, $590,000 was
available for future borrowings under this line of credit. Future principal
payments under this line of credit are as follows:

NOTE 4 INCOME TAXES:
The historical provisions for income taxes for the years ended December 31,
1997 and 1996 reflect S corporation taxes imposed in California at the statutory
rate of 15% of taxable income, adjusted for nondeductible items. On June 6,
1997, the Company became subject to the C corporation provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code. No provision for income taxes has been recognized for periods
subsequent to June 6, 1997, as the Company incurred net operating losses for
income tax purposes and has no carryback potential.
The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities at
December 31, 1998 and 1997 were as follows:
DECEMBER 31,
1998      1997
Net operating loss and tax credit  $  4,788,000 $  1,087,000
Nondeductible reserves and     288,000     82,000
Gross deferred tax    5,076,000   1,169,000
Valuation    5,076,000  1,169,000
Net deferred tax  $     -- $                                                                            
Due to the Company change in strategy and recent operating losses,
management believes that there is sufficient uncertainty regarding the
realization of deferred tax assets such that a full valuation allowance is
appropriate.
At December 31, 1998, the Company had a federal net operating loss
carryforward of approximately $114 million available to reduce future taxable
income, which expires from 2013 to 2014. The Company ability to utilize net
operating loss and tax credits carryforwards may be subject to limitation as set
forth in

applicable federal and state tax laws. As specified in the Internal Revenue
Code, an ownership change of more than 50% during any three-year period would
result in certain annual limitations on the Company ability to utilize its net
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
NOTE 5 MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK:
In May and June 1997, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation
to authorize a total of 7,400,000 shares of Preferred Stock for future issuance.
In June 1997, the Company completed a private placement of 3,621,503 shares of
Series A Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock the Series A for
$260 per share, resulting in proceeds of $8,672,000, net of issuance costs of
$744,000.
The Series A stockholders were entitled to annual dividends at a rate of
$0312 per share subject to adjustment for dilution or stock splits. Such
dividends were noncumulative and were payable when and if declared by the Board
of Directors provided, however, that such dividends would be deemed to be
accrued and cumulatively payable upon the redemption of the Series A shares or a
liquidation or dissolution of the Company. Accordingly, such amounts were
accreted to the carrying value of the Series A shares with a corresponding
charge to accumulated deficit. The Series A shares carried a liquidation
preference of $260 per share subject to adjustment for dilution and stock
splits plus all declared but unpaid dividends, and were convertible at any time
at the option of the holder on a one-for-one basis subject to adjustment for
antidilution into shares of the Company Common Stock. The Series A
stockholders had one vote for each share of Common Stock into which such shares
could be converted.
NOTE 6 STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY DEFICIT:
In December 1997, the Board of Directors increased the authorized number of
shares of the Company Common Stock to 50,000,000, which was approved by the
stockholders in March 1998. The Company has the right to repurchase, at the
original issuance price, certain of the shares of Common Stock issued to
employees and directors under restricted stock agreements. The Company
repurchase right lapses over four years based on the length of the individual
continual service with the Company. At December 31, 1998, 45,000 shares of
Common Stock were subject to repurchase by the Company.
In connection with the Company initial public offering, the Board of
Directors authorized, and the stockholders approved in February 1998, a
one-for-two reverse stock split of the Company Common and Series A Stock. All
share and per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.
In connection with the Series A private placement in June 1997, the Company
issued to the placement agent two warrants to purchase a total of 65,653 shares
of Series A at an exercise price of $520 per share. The warrants originally
were to expire on the earlier of June 6, 2002, the closing of an initial public
offering of the Company Common Stock pursuant to a registration statement
under the Securities Act of 1993 or a merger or sale of substantially all of the
Company assets and were exercisable immediately. On March 12, 1998, the terms
of the warrants were amended such that the warrants are now exercisable to
purchase 65,653 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $700 per share
and expire in 2001. The Company determined the value of the amended warrants to
be de minimus.

NOTE 6 STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY DEFICIT: CONTINUED
In connection with the Company entering into a line of credit agreement with
a leasing company in February 1998, the Company issued a warrant to purchase up
to 13,290 shares of the Company Common Stock at $538. The actual number of
shares to be issued under the warrants will be based on 55% of the borrowings
against the line of credit divided by the exercise price of $538. As of
December 31, 1998, the leasing company is entitled under the warrant to purchase
up to 8,025 shares of the Company Common Stock at an exercise price of $538,
none of which were exercised as of December 31, 1998. The warrant will expire in
February 2002. The Company determined the value of the warrant to be de minimus.
At December 31, 1998, the Company had 20 million shares of Preferred Stock
authorized, of which no shares were issued and outstanding.
NOTE 7 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS:
On January 10, 1994, the Company adopted the 1994 Equity Incentive Plan the
1994 Plan under which 499,500 shares of the Company Common Stock were
reserved for issuance to employees, directors and consultants of the Company, as
approved by the Board of Directors. On March 14, 1997, the Company reduced the
number of shares reserved for issuance under the 1994 Plan to 479,250. The 1994
Plan, which expires in 2004, provides for the grant of incentive as well as
nonstatutory stock options, stock bonuses, stock appreciation rights and
restricted stock purchase rights.
In March 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Stock Plan the 1997 Plan
under which 820,750 shares of the Company Common Stock including 20,250
shares originally reserved under the 1994 Plan have been reserved for issuance
to employees, directors and consultants of the Company, as approved by the Board
of Directors. The 1997 Plan, which expires in 2007, provides for the grant of
incentive as well as nonstatutory stock options and restricted stock purchase
rights.
Options granted under the 1994 Plan and the 1997 Plan are for terms not to
exceed ten years. If the option is granted to a stockholder who owns more than
10% of outstanding stock of the Company, the term may not exceed five years and
the exercise price of the stock option must be at least 110% of the fair market
value of the stock at the date of grant. Exercise prices of incentive stock
options granted to all other persons are generally equal to at least 100% of the
fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. For nonstatutory stock
options granted to all other persons, the exercise price under the 1994 Plan and
the 1997 Plan is generally equal to at least 50% or 85%, respectively, of the
fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. Options under the plans
generally vest over a five year period.
The term of restricted stock purchase rights granted under the 1997 Plan is
thirty days, after which unaccepted stock purchase rights expire. If the stock
purchase right is granted to a stockholder who owns stock representing more than
10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company,
the exercise price is generally at least equal to 100% of the fair market value
of the stock on the date of grant. The exercise price of stock purchase rights
granted to all other persons is generally equal to at least 85% of the fair
market value of the stock on the date of grant. There were no unaccepted
restricted stock purchase rights outstanding at December 31, 1998 or 1997.
On December 16, 1997, the Board of Directors adopted the 1998 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan the 1998 Purchase Plan and the 1998 Directors' Plan and
reserved 300,000 and 150,000 shares of Common Stock, respectively, for issuance
under these plans. The 1998 Purchase Plan, which is intended to qualify under
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code, permits eligible employees to purchase
Common Stock through payroll deductions at a purchase price equal to 85% of the
fair market value of the Company

Common Stock at the beginning or end of the offering period, whichever is less.
During 1998, 15,387 shares were issued under the 1998 Purchase Plan. The 1998
Directors' Plan provides for certain automatic grants of nonstatutory stock
options to nonemployee directors of the Company. Options granted under the 1998
Directors' Plan vest over four years, have a term of ten years and are granted
at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company Common Stock
on the date of grant.
On December 16, 1997, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the
1997 Plan to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance by 1,250,000

Deferred compensation is recorded when the exercise price of an option is
less than the deemed fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
From inception through June 1997, all stock options were granted at exercise
prices which equaled the estimated fair value of the underlying stock on the
respective grant dates. In August 1997, the Company granted options to purchase
a total of 75,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $100 per
share. Deferred compensation of approximately $56,000 was recorded on these
options, based on the deemed fair value of the Common Stock on the date of grant
of $175 per share. In October 1997, the Company granted options to purchase
24,500 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $100 per share.
Additional deferred compensation of approximately $123,000 was recorded based on
a deemed fair value of $600 per share on the date of grant. Additionally, in
October 1997 the Company granted to a consultant options to purchase 7,500
shares of the Company Common Stock at an exercise price of $100 per share,
resulting in additional deferred compensation of $40,000 based on the estimated
fair value of the options granted. In December 1997, the Company granted rights
to purchase 45,000 shares of restricted Common Stock at an exercise price of
$200 per share and options to purchase 30,250 shares of Common Stock at an
exercise price of $200 per share. Additional deferred compensation of
approximately $553,000 related to these grants was recorded based on a deemed
fair value of the Common Stock of $935 per share on the date of grant. On March
10, 1998, the Company granted an option to an employee to purchase 15,000 shares
of the Company Common Stock at a price 15% below fair market value at the date
of the grant. Deferred compensation of $33,600 was recorded based on the
estimated fair value of the options granted. Deferred compensation is amortized
over the vesting period of the options, generally four to five years.
In December 1997, the Company also granted fully vested options to employees
to purchase 75,000 shares of Common Stock at exercise prices of $200 to $220
per share, in lieu of cash bonuses. Compensation expense of $547,000 related to
these options, based on a deemed fair value of the Common Stock on the date of
grant of $935 per share, was recognized in 1997.
At December 31, 1998, the Company had 2,329,112 shares of Common Stock
reserved for future issuance upon the exercise of stock options and Common Stock
purchase warrants.
The Company accounts for its stock option plans in accordance with the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. Had compensation cost
for the Company option plans been determined based on the fair value of the
options at the dates of grant, as prescribed in SFAS 123, the Company pro
forma net income loss for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996
would have included additional stock compensation expense of $286,000, $10,000
and $2,000, respectively. The fair value of each option has been estimated on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for all options
granted after the effective date of the Company initial public offering on
March 13, 1998 and using the minimum value method for options granted prior to
the initial public offering. The following assumptions were used in computing
the fair value of options granted: dividend yield of 00% for 1998, 1997 and
1996; risk-free interest rates of 440% to 565% for 1998, 63% to 65% for 1997
and 55% to 68% for 1996; volatility of 84% for options granted after the
effective date of the Company initial public offering on March 13, 1998; and a
weighted average expected option term of four years for 1998 and 1997 and six
years for 1996.
Additional option grants are expected to be made beyond 1998. Accordingly,
pro forma disclosures may differ significantly from the reported results of
operations in the future.

as certain facility operating expenses incurred by the lessor. In July 1997, the
Company entered into a second lease agreement for a laboratory facility and the
use of certain laboratory equipment. During 1998, the lease was amended to
extend the lease term to May 1999, at which time the lease may be continued on a
month-to-month basis. In April 1998, the Company entered into a lease agreement
for a facility in the United Kingdom with a lease term to April 1999, at which
time the lease may be continued on a quarter-to-quarter basis. In May 1998, the
