Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.. 26              INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Hello Direct, Inc.     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Hello Direct, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December
31, 1999. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Hello
Direct, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.                 KPMG LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997 1  Summary of the Company and Significant Accounting Policies
The Company. Hello Direct, Inc. the Company is a leading developer
and direct marketer of desktop telephony products and equipment interface
solutions to business end users. The Company designs and sells its own
products and also offers a wide variety of products and accessories from
other manufacturers. The Company markets its products through various
sales channels which include full-color catalogs, the internet and
outbound telemarketing efforts aimed at current and prospective customers.
The Company wholly owned subsidiary, PhoneZone.com, Inc. PhoneZone,
was acquired on January 20, 1999 and is an influential source of
comparative research, analysis, and purchase information on telecom and
networking solutions for small- and medium-size companies.
Basis of Accounting. The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, PhoneZone. All intercompany transactions have been
eliminated.
Cash Equivalents. The Company considers all highly liquid investments
purchased with an original maturity date of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of government agency
obligations, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and money market
funds and amounted to $4,409,000 and $2,878,000 as of December 31, 1999
and 1998, respectively.
Short-Term Investments. Short-term investments consist of high quality
money market instruments, primarily commercial paper with original
maturities greater than three months and less than twelve months.
Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method.
Catalog Costs. Catalog costs are deferred and amortized over the
expected revenue stream, generally nine months.
Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. Amortization of leasehold improvements is
calculated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated
useful life of the asset or the term of the respective lease. The
estimated useful lives are presented below       Comptuer equipment and software     5
Furniture and fixtures        3 - 7
Production tooling and equipment    5
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. The Company periodically reviews
its long-lived assets for impairment. If events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the
Company will reduce the carrying amount of the asset by the amount
determined not to be recoverable. Recoverability of property and
equipment is measured by comparing to its carrying amount to future net
cash flows the property and equipment are expected to generate. If such
assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property and
equipment exceeds its fair market value. Recoverability of goodwill is
assessed by determining whether the unamortized goodwill balance can be
recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the acquired
operation. The amount of goodwill impairment, if any, is measured based
on projected discounted future net cash flows using a discount rate
reflecting the Company average cost of funds. To date, no adjustments
to the carrying value of the Company long-lived assets have been
required.
Income Taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and
liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate
is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue at the time
of the product shipment. Appropriate provisions are provided for customer
returns, warranty, and exchanges.
Goodwill. Goodwill is amortized using the straight-line method
over the expected life of the asset.
Net Income Per Share.  There were no adjustments to net income for
purposes of the calculation of diluted net income per share. The table
below reconciles basic weighted average shares outstanding to diluted
weighted average shares outstanding                        1999     1998     1997
Basic weighted shares outstanding      5,167,000  5,108,000  5,036,000

Diluted weighted shares outstanding     5,352,000  5,199,000  5,117,000
Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
Stock Option and Stock Purchase Plan Accounting. Compensation
expense associated with stock option grants and stock purchase plan
purchases made subsequent to 1994 is disclosed in the footnotes to the
financial statements. The effect on net income and net income per share
is reflected in pro forma - net income, pro forma - basic net income per
share, and pro forma - diluted net income per share amounts.
Concentration of Credit Risk. The Company offers credit terms to
customers after an evaluation of a customer financial condition. No one
customer accounts for a substantial part of sales or receivables. The
Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the
creditworthiness of its customers as well as general economic conditions.
Consequently, an adverse change in those factors could affect the
Company estimate of its bad debts.
2 Acquisition of PhoneZone.com, Inc.
On January 20, 1999, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock
of PhoneZone, a privately held company for $1,500,000 in cash, 50,000
shares of common stock valued at $500,000 and the assumption of $50,000 of
outstanding debt. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting, and the purchase price was allocated to assets
acquired based on their estimated fair values. This treatment resulted in
$2,000,000 of cost in excess of net assets, to be amortized on a straight-
line basis over a five-year period.
Proforma results of operations, as if PhoneZone had been acquired as of
January 1, 1999 and 1998, are not presented as PhoneZone had no
significant operations prior to the acquisition and the assets and
liabilities acquired were not material to the financial statements of the
Company.
3  Other Current Assets
A summary of other current assets as of December 31, 1999 and 1998
follows                        1999     1998
Deferred catalog costs.  $1,258,000  $1,972,000
Other..   646,000   502,000
$1,904,000  $2,474,000
4  Note Receivable
In 1996 the Company entered into a loan agreement with a developer
for the construction of the Company corporate facility. Through 1997, the
Company had loaned $5,000,000 under this loan agreement. The borrowings
under this loan agreement are secured by the building and land, bear
interest at 75% with principal and interest due in monthly installments
of $53,000 over 12 years. The fair value of the loan as of December 31,
1999 is estimated to approximate its face value which was calculated by
discounting the future cash flows using the current interest rate at which
a similar loan would be made to the developer for the same remaining
maturity. The note contains a provision that if the developer defaults on
the monthly payment, the Company can offset the non-payment against their
monthly rent payment. The lease agreement contains a similar provision
for non-payment.
In connection with the loan agreement, the Company entered into a
15-year lease agreement. The present value of the total future minimum lease
payments under the lease is approximately $5,818,000 as of December 31,
1999, which approximates the fair value of the lease using rates currently
available to the Company for a lease with similar terms note 8.

bank to provide a $7,000,000 unsecured revolving line of credit for both
working capital and letters of credit. As of December 31, 1999 7,000,000 was available under the agreement. Any borrowings bear interest
at the bank prime rate 85% as of December 31, 1999. The line of
credit will expire on May 15, 2000, at which time the Company intends to
renew. The agreement contains various financial covenants, including
profitability and financial ratios such as, quick ratio and debt-to-net-
worth. As of December 31, 1999, there were no direct borrowings under the
credit facility, and the Company was not liable for issued and open
letters of credit.

The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 in
accounting for its various stock option plans and Employee Stock Purchase
Plan the stock plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been
recognized for the stock plans. However, if the Company had determined
compensation costs pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
SFAS No. 123 for its stock plans, the Company net income and net
income per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts
indicated below for the years noted                        1999     1998     1997
Pro forma - net income..  $2,908,000  $2,084,000  $1,483,000
Pro forma - basic net income
per share..    $056    $041    $029
Pro forma - diluted net income
per share..    $054    $040    $029     Pro forma net income reflects only options granted after December 31,
1994. Accordingly, the full impact of calculating compensation cost for
the Company stock plans under SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in the pro
forma net income amounts presented above, as compensation cost is captured
over a stock option vesting period, and compensation cost for options
granted prior to January 1, 1995 is not considered.
