the Company sold a 50%
tenancy-in-common
interest in the property to a third party and reflected its
remaining interest in the property as an equity method
investment. In December 2006, the Company increased its
ownership in the property to 100%. From that date forward, the
property was again consolidated.   The financial statements include an equity method investment in
a 199% owned real estate venture, as well as certain cost
method investments in various entities included as other assets,
over which the Company does not exercise significant influence.
In addition, the Company hold a 3% common interest in Red Lion
Hotels Capital Trust the Trust that is considered
a variable interest entity under FIN-46R Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities, as revised. The Company is
not the primary beneficiary of the Trust; thus, it is treated as
an equity method investment.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   Principles
of Consolidation   The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America GAAP, and include all
accounts and wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries
accounts. All significant inter-company transactions and
accounts have been eliminated upon consolidation. In addition,
certain other amounts disclosed in prior period statements have
been reclassified to

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   conform to the current period presentation; however, this
reclassification had no effect on net income loss or retained
earnings as previously reported.   Cash
and Cash Equivalents   All highly liquid investments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash
equivalents. At times, cash balances at banks and other
financial institutions may be in excess of federal insurance
limits.   Investments   At December31, 2006, the Company included variable rate
demand notes as current investments on the consolidated balance
sheet. Variable rate demand notes are highly liquid short-term
investments with maturities of less than one year, and were all
liquidated during the first quarter of 2007. The variable rate
demand notes were recorded at cost, which approximated fair
value at December31, 2006. Gross realized gains and losses
were immaterial in all periods presented.   Restricted
Cash   In accordance with the Companys various borrowing
arrangements, at December31, 2007 and 2006, cash of
approximately $44million and $28million,
respectively, was held in escrow for the future payment of
insurance, property taxes, repairs and furniture and fixtures.   Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts   The ability to collect individual accounts receivable is
reviewed on a routine basis. Allowances for doubtful accounts
are recorded based on specifically identified amounts believed
to be uncollectible and for those accounts past due beyond a
certain date, generally 90days. If actual collection
experience changes, revisions to the allowance may be required
and if all attempts to collect a receivable fail, it is recorded
against the allowance. The estimate of the allowance for
doubtful accounts is impacted by, among other things, national
and regional economic conditions.   The following schedule summarizes the activity in the allowance
account for trade accounts receivable for the past three years

Held for Sale   Assets held for sale are accounted for in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Number
SFASNo. 144 Accounting for the
Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, and are
recorded at the lower of their historical cost less accumulated
depreciation or market value less costs to sell. In accordance
with SFASNo144, depreciation is suspended when the
asset is determined to be held for sale. If the assets are
ultimately not sold, depreciation would be recaptured. For
additional information with regard to assets held for sale, as
well as discontinued operations, see Note3 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.   Property
and Equipment   Property and equipment are stated at cost. The cost of
improvements that extend the life of property and equipment are
capitalized. Interest costs are capitalized as incurred during
the construction period for qualifying assets. During 2006 and
2005, the Company capitalized approximately $173,000 and
$32,000, respectively. No interest was capitalized in 2007.
Repairs and maintenance charges are expensed as incurred.   Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful life of each asset, which range as follows   	
Buildings   25 to 39years   Equipment   2 to 20years   Furniture and fixtures   5 to 15years   Landscaping and improvements   15years   Valuation
of Long-Lived Assets   Management reviews the carrying value of property, equipment and
other long-lived assets at least annually, or upon the
occurrence of other events or changes in circumstances that
indicate the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
Estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared with the
assets current carrying value. Reductions to the carrying
value, if necessary, are recorded to the extent the net book
value of the asset exceeds the greater of estimated future
discounted cash flows or fair value less selling costs, in
accordance with SFASNo144. During 2005, the Company
recorded impairment charges in connection with the sale of
certain discontinued operations, as discussed in Note3 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. No asset impairment
charges were recorded during 2007 or 2006.   Goodwill
and Intangible Assets   Goodwill represents the excess of the estimated fair value of
the net assets acquired during business combinations over the
net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, or when
circumstances dictate, and is not otherwise amortized.   The Red Lion brand name is an identifiable, indefinite life
intangible asset that represents the separable legal right to a
trade name acquired in a business combination the Company
entered into in 2001. Remaining intangible assets consist
primarily of the net amortized cost of lease, management and
franchise contracts acquired in business combinations, including
the one in 2001. The costs of these contracts are amortized over
the weighted-average remaining term of the related agreements.

consolidated balance sheet. At December31, 2007, the cash
balance remaining undisbursed in that account was
$22million.   Cost method investments are carried at their original purchase
price, less any impairment recognized to date. Equity method
investments are carried at cost, adjusted for the Companys
proportionate share of earnings and any investment
disbursements. At each of December31, 2007 and 2006, the
Company had a $03million note receivable that bore
interest at 705% related to its investment in a real estate
venture. The note was originally due in August 2007, and was
later amended for payment due in February 2011.   Income
Taxes   Deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax expenses and
benefits are recognized for the expected future income tax
consequences of events that have been recognized in the
consolidated financial statements. The deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences
between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in
which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Certain
wholly or partially-owned entities, including RLHLP, do not
directly pay income taxes. Instead, their taxable income either
flows through to the Company or to the other respective owners
of the entities. A valuation allowance against the deferred tax
assets has not been established as its more likely than
not that these assets will be realized.   Revenue
Recognition and Receivables   Revenue is generally recognized as services are provided. When
payments from customers are received before services have been
performed, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue
until the service has been completed. The Company recognizes
revenue from the following sources   
Hotels Room rental and food and beverage
sales from owned and leased hotels. Revenues are recognized when
services have been performed, generally at the time of the hotel
stay or guests visit to the restaurant.   
Franchise and Management Fees received in
connection with the franchise of the Red Lion brand name,
management fees earned from managing third-party owned hotels
and termination fees. Franchise and management revenues are
recognized as earned in accordance with the contractual terms of
the franchise or management agreements, while termination fees
are recorded as revenues as if the agreements were terminated at
that date when the provisions of the franchise or management
agreements provide for receipt of incentive fees upon
termination.   
Entertainment Computerized event ticketing
services and promotion of Broadway-style shows and other special
events. Where the Company acts as an agent and receives a net
fee or commission, it is recognized as revenue in the period the
services are performed. When the Company is the promoter of an
event and is at-risk for the production, revenues and expenses
are recorded in the period of the event performance.   In June 2006, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF
No06-03,
How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
Statement That is, Gross versus Net Presentation
EITF
No06-03.
EITF
No06-03
provides that the presentation of taxes assessed by a
governmental authority that is directly imposed on a
revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer on
either a gross basis included in revenues and costs or on a
net basis excluded from revenues is an accounting policy
decision that should be disclosed. The provisions of EITF
No06-03
became effective as of December31, 2006, and did not
change the Companys accounting policy of net presentation,
nor have an effect on the Companys financial position or
results of operations.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Advertising
and Promotion   Costs associated with advertising and promotional efforts are
generally expensed as incurred. During the years ended
December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company incurred
approximately $21million, $19million and
$19million, respectively, in advertising expense for
continuing operations. In addition, the Company incurred
advertising expenses associated with discontinued operations of
approximately $01million and $02million,
respectively, during 2006 and 2005, and a deminimus amount in
2007. These amounts are exclusive of advertising and promotion
spent by the Red Lion Central Program Fund discussed below.   Central
Program Fund   In 2002, the Company established the Central Program Fund
CPF in accordance with the Companys various
domestic franchise agreements. The CPF is responsible for
certain advertising services, frequent guest program
administration, reservation services, national sales promotions
and brand and revenue management services intended to increase
sales and enhance the reputation of the Red Lion brand. CPF
contributions for company owned and managed hotels and those
made by the franchisees, based on the individual franchise
agreements, total up to 45% of room revenue or in some cases
are based on reservation fees, frequent guest program dues and
other services. The net assets and transactions of the CPF are
not included in the accompanying financial statements in
accordance with SFASNo45, Accounting for
Franchise Fee Revenue.   For the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the
Company recorded operating expenses of $70million,
$62million, and $64million, respectively, based on
contributions for the period to the CPF. At December31,
2007 and 2006, the Company had a net current receivable from the
CPF of approximately $15million and $16million,
respectively.   Basic
and Diluted Earnings Loss Per Share   Basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing income
loss by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings loss per share gives
effect to all dilutive potential shares that are outstanding
during the period and includes outstanding stock options and
other outstanding employee equity grants, as well as the effect
of minority interests related to operating partnership units of
RLHLP OPUnits, by increasing the
weighted-average number of shares outstanding by their effect.   Use of
Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could
materially differ from those estimates.   New
Accounting Pronouncements   In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an
interpretation of FASB Statement No109
FIN48. FIN48 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes by establishing minimum
standards for the recognition and measurement of tax positions
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under the
requirements of FIN48, a company must review all of its
uncertain tax positions and make a determination as to whether
its position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon
examination by regulatory authorities. If a position meets the
more-likely-than-not criterion, then the related tax benefit is
measured based on the cumulative probability analysis of the
amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate
settlement. FIN48 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December15, 2006. The adoption of the provisions of
FIN48 did not have an impact on the Companys
financial condition or results of operations.

Compensated Absences. Under EITF
No06-2,
the compensation cost associated with a sabbatical or other
similar benefit arrangement should be accrued over the requisite

SFASNo43 for arrangements in which the individual
continues to be a compensated employee and is not required to

No06-2
was effective for the Company on January1, 2007, and the
adoption of the provisions of EITF
No06-2
did not materially impact its financial condition or results of
operations.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo157,
Fair Value Measurements
SFASNo157. SFASNo157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements.
SFASNo157 does not require any new fair value
measurements itself. However, this statement applies under other
accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value
measurements and may therefore change current practice if an
alternative measure of fair value has been used.
SFASNo157 applies an exchange price notion for fair
value consistent with previously preferred practice, with a
focus on exit price and market-based measurements as compared to
entry price and entity-specific measurements.
SFASNo157 is effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007.
However, in December 2007, the FASB issued proposed FSP
FAS157-b,
which would delay the effective date of SFASNo157
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except
those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually.
This proposed FSP partially defers the effective date of
SFASNo157 to fiscal years beginning after
November15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal
years for items within the scope of this FSP. Effective
January1, 2008, the Company adopted SFASNo157
except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities as noted in proposed FSP
FAS157-b.
The partial adoption of SFASNo157 did not
materially impact its financial condition or results of
operations.   In February 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo159,
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement
No115 SFASNo159.
SFASNo159 permits entities to choose to measure
many financial instruments and certain other items at fair
value, the objective of which is to improve financial reporting
by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate
volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related
assets and liabilities differently without having to apply
complex hedge accounting provisions. This statement is expected
to expand the use of fair value measurement, which is consistent
with FASBs long-term measurement objectives for accounting
for financial instruments. SFASNo159 is effective
as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that
begins after November15, 2007. The adoption of
SFASNo159 on January1, 2008, did not
materially impact the Companys financial condition or
results of operations.   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo141
revised 2007, Business Combinations
SFASNo141R and
SFASNo160, Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of Accounting
Research BulletinNo51
SFASNo160. SFASNo141R
will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will
impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in
subsequent periods. SFASNo160 will change the
accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be
recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a
component of equity. SFASNo141R and
SFASNo160 are effective for annual periods
beginning after December15, 2008, and early adoption is
not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
that the adoption of SFASNo141R and
SFASNo160 could have on its consolidated financial
statements.

Assets
Held For Sale and Discontinued Operations   In November 2004, the Company announced its plan to divest
non-strategic assets, including eleven of its owned hotels,
certain commercial office buildings and certain other non-core
properties including condominium   
62 Table of Contents   RED LION
HOTELS CORPORATION
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   units and certain parcels of excess land collectively referred
to as the divestment properties. Each of the
divestment properties met the criteria to be classified as an
asset held for sale. The activities of the hotels and commercial
office buildings were considered discontinued operations under
generally accepted accounting principles and have been
separately disclosed on the consolidated statement of
operations, comparative for all periods presented when they
existed. Likewise, the assets and liabilities of the business
units have been segregated and separately stated on the
consolidated balance sheet for all periods presented when they
existed. Depreciation of these assets, if previously
appropriate, was suspended.   During 2005, the Company sold seven of the eleven hotels
included under the November 2004 divestment plan and one
commercial building, and during 2006 the Company sold three
additional hotels. During the second quarter of 2007, the
Company sold the remaining hotel located in Kalispell, Montana
for gross proceeds of $39million. In 2006 and 2005, the
Company received gross proceeds of approximately
$158million and $528million, respectively, and
recognized a loss on the disposition of discontinued operations
of $01million in 2006 and a gain of $37million in
2005, both net of income tax expense. Proceeds from the sales
have been used to finance the company-wide hotel renovation
program, to repay $200million in debt and for general
corporate purposes. The net impact on consolidated earnings from
the activities of these operations resulted in income from
discontinued operations of $08million in 2007, compared
to a loss of $01million in 2006 and income of
$55million in 2005, net of income tax expense.   The 2005 gain on the sale accounted for $66million, net
of tax expense, of net income from discontinued operations,
offset by the recording of an impairment loss of
$29million, net of tax expense, for the four hotel
properties. The Company evaluated the divestment properties for
potential impairment in accordance with the provisions of
SFASNo144 Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-lived Assets. The impairment amounts were
calculated using expected sales prices, less expected
transaction costs, as compared to the carrying value at the date
of the evaluation. No impairment loss was recorded during 2007
or 2006.   The Company holds undeveloped land that had been classified as
held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet in 2006. While
continuing to pursue the disposition of the assets, the Company
determined the land no longer meets the accounting criteria for
such classification. During June 2007, approximately
$07million was reclassified to property and equipment for
all periods presented.   During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company listed for sale a
commercial office and retail complex located in Spokane,
Washington that was included as a component of discontinued
operations on the consolidated financial statements, comparative
for all periods presented. In June 2007, the Company borrowed an
additional $39million available on an existing
construction loan collateralized by the commercial office
complex. In September 2007, the Company sold the complex to
Barbieri Real Estate Company, which is owned by a former
executive who is also the brother of two members of the
Companys board of directors, for $133million in a
tax advantaged transaction as a result of the surrender of
operating partnership units of RLHLP OP units. The
consideration for the sale was provided through a combination of
a payment of $42million in cash, the exchange for
redemption of 97,826 OPUnits for further information, see
Note10, and the assumption of $76million of debt.
The Company recognized a gain on the sale of $19million.
The structure of the sale allowed a portion of the tax on the
gain to be deferred, further enhancing the economic return to
the Company. The sale was approved by the independent members of
the Companys board of directors.

Real
Estate Management Business   On April30, 2006, the Company divested on a tax-free basis
the real estate management portion of its real estate division
for $11million, to an existing company executive and a
former company executive who is also the brother of two members
of the Companys board of directors. The sale was in
exchange for 94,311shares of unrestricted Red Lion Hotels
Corporation common stock that was subsequently retired. The
transaction resulted in a gain on sale of approximately
$10million. The new entity continues to manage the
Companys office and retail real estate assets through
specific management agreements. For the full year 2005, the real
estate management business contributed $23million and
$01million to the Companys revenue and operating
income, respectively.

long-term leasehold interest in a 310-room hotel in Anaheim,
California for $83million, including costs of the
acquisition. As required under the terms of the assumed
leasehold agreement, the Company will pay $18million per
year for five years in lease payments, to be adjusted every five
years thereafter based on the terms of the agreement and tied
directly to the Consumer Price Index. The Company plans to spend
approximately $100million on extensive renovations to
guest rooms and public areas and reposition the hotel to meet
Red Lion brand standards, of which approximately
$50million will be spent in 2008.   In July 2005, the Company sold a 50% interest in its Kalispell
Center retail and hotel complex to an unrelated third party for
$63million, resulting in a net gain of $03million
included in continuing operations. The Company continued to
manage the retail component of the complex and leased back the
WestCoast Kalispell Center Hotel, which was re-branded the Red
Lion Kalispell Hotel after undergoing expansion and renovation.
The Companys remaining 50% ownership interest of
$61million was reflected as an equity method investment
from the date of the sale, as discussed in Note1. In
December 2006, the Company increased its ownership to 100% for
approximately $20million in cash and a $33million
note payable due in 2008.   In 2003, the Company sold one of its hotels to an unrelated
party in a sale-operating leaseback transaction. The pre-tax
gain on the transaction of approximately $70million was
deferred and is being amortized into income over the period of
the lease term, which expires in November 2018 and is renewable
for three, five-year terms at the Companys option. During
2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized income of
approximately $05million each year for the amortization
of the deferred gain. The remaining balance at December31,
2007, was $51million.   In 2002, the Company sold an 801% interest in its corporate
office building, retaining a lease of office space and the
remaining ownership interest. A portion of the gain on sale was
deferred over the six-year lease term, which concluded
amortization at December31, 2007. The 199% interest in
the partnership is accounted for under the equity method of
accounting and is included as an investment in other noncurrent
assets on the consolidated balance sheet, as discussed in
Note6 below. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company
recognized income of approximately $03million each year
for the amortization of the deferred gain, with no amount
outstanding at December31, 2007.

Other
Investments   As of December31, 2007 and 2006, aggregate investments
recorded as noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet
totaled $13million and $14million, respectively.
During 2007, the Company recorded income from investments of
$40,000, compared to losses of $152,000 and $63,000 in 2006 and
2005, respectively.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   As of December31, 2007, the Company holds more than a 99%
interest in RLHLP. Partners who hold operating partnership units
OPUnits have the right to put those units to
RLHLP, in which event either iRLHLP must redeem the
units for cash, or iithe Company, as general partner,
may elect to acquire the OPUnits for cash or in exchange
for a like number of shares of its common stock. In September
2007 and as a component of a commercial office complex discussed
above in Note3, the Company accepted 97,826 OPUnits
held by limited partners for a fair market value of $927 per
OPUnit, based upon the trading price for the
Companys common stock during the five days before the
sale. The redemption resulted in a non-cash adjustment of the
minority interest balance of $03million and an increase
of $06million to property and equipment as a result of
the step-up
in value of the Companys investment in RLHLP. At
December31, 2007, 44,837 OPUnits held by limited
partners remained outstanding.   During the first quarter of 2006, the Company elected to issue
143,498shares of its common stock in exchange for a like
number of OPUnits that then certain limited partners put
to RLHLP. The exchange resulted in a non-cash adjustment of the
minority interest balance of $22million, with a
corresponding increase to common stock and additional
paid-in-capital.   Beginning March 2002, the Company owned a 199% partnership
interest in its corporate office building as discussed above in
Note5. At both December31, 2007 and 2006, the
Companys investment balance was approximately
$07million. Summarized unaudited financial information

all of the common ownership of the Trust. The Trust is
considered a variable interest entity under FIN-46R and the
Company is not considered its primary beneficiary. At
December31, 2007 and 2006, the Companys equity

$06million and $07million, respectively, after
adjusting for trust earnings and operating expenses.

Debentures
of Red Lion Hotels Capital Trust   Together with the Trust, the Company completed a public offering
of $460million of trust preferred securities in 2004. The
securities are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and entitle
holders to cumulative cash distributions at a 95% annual rate
with maturity in February 2044. The cost of the offering totaled
$23million, which the Trust paid through an advance by
the Company. The advance to the Trust is included with other
noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet.   The Company borrowed all of the proceeds from the offering,
including the Companys original 3% trust common investment
of $14million, on the same day through
95%debentures that are included as a long-term liability
on the consolidated balance sheet. The payment terms mirror the
distribution terms of the trust securities and mature in 2044.
The debenture agreement required the mandatory redemption of 35%
of the then outstanding trust securities at 105% of issued value
if the Company completed an offering of common shares with gross
proceeds of greater than $50million. In accordance
therewith and in connection with the offering of common stock

approximately $166million of the debentures due the
Trust. The Trust then redeemed 35% of the outstanding trust
preferred securities and trust common securities at a price of
$2625 per share, a 5% premium over the issued value of the
securities. Of the $166million, approximately
$05million was received back by the Company for its trust
common securities and was reflected as a reduction of its
investment in the Trust. The $08million premium paid to

Notes
Payable to Bank   In September 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit
facility for up to $50million with a syndication of banks
led by Calyon New York Branch. Subject to certain conditions,
including the provision of additional collateral acceptable to
the lenders, the size of the facility may be increased at the
Companys request to up to $100million. The initial
maturity date for the facility is September13, 2009, but
the Company has the right to extend the maturity for two
additional one year terms. Borrowings under the facility may be
used to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures, for
working capital and for other general corporate purposes. The
obligations under the facility are collateralized by a company
owned hotel, including a deed of trust and security agreement
covering all of its assets, as well as by unsecured guaranties
of the Company and certain of its other subsidiaries. In
connection with this transaction, the Company paid loan fees and
related costs of approximately $09million, which have
been deferred and are being amortized over the initial term of
the facility.   Outstanding borrowings under the facility accrue interest as
Eurodollar loans with rates ranging from 150 to 225basis
points over LIBOR, with an option for base rate loans based upon
the federal funds rate or prime rate. The credit facility
requires the Company to comply with certain customary
affirmative and negative covenants, the most restrictive of
which are financial covenants dealing with leverage, interest
coverage and debt service coverage. At December31, 2007
and 2006, no amounts were outstanding and the Company was in
compliance with all of its covenants.   Up to the date of the new revolving credit facility, the Company
maintained a revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association Wells Fargo. No amounts were
borrowed under any portion of the credit facility with Wells
Fargo, which was terminated in September 2006.

Stock Offering   In May 2006, the Company completed a public offering of
5million shares of common stock at $1100 per share,
resulting in net proceeds of $516million after an
underwriting discount and other offering costs totaling
approximately $34million. In June 2006, the underwriter
of the offering exercised its over-allotment option and an
additional 845,302shares of common stock were issued at
$1100 per share, resulting in additional net proceeds of
approximately $88million net of an underwriting discount.
The proceeds were primarily used to retire existing long-term
debt, pay related defeasance costs and to fund the retirement of
debentures. All remaining proceeds were used for general working
capital purposes. An additional 635,344shares were sold in
the May 2006 offering by certain shareholders; however, the
Company received no proceeds from sale of these shares.   Stock
Incentive Plans   The 1998 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan
the Plans authorize the grant or issuance of
various option or other awards including stock appreciation
rights SARs, restricted stock grants and other
stock-based compensation. The plans were approved by the common
shareholders of the Company. The 2006 plan allows awards up to a
maximum number of 10million shares, subject to
adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and similar
events. The 1998 plan allowed for a maximum number of
14million shares, although as a condition to the approval
of the 2006 plan, the Company will no longer grant or issue
awards under this plan. The compensation committee of the board
of directors administers the 2006 plan and establishes to whom,
and the type and terms and conditions, including the exercise
period, of the awards that may be granted. As of

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   2007, there were 619,697shares of common stock available
for issuance pursuant to future stock option grants or other
awards under the 2006 plan.   Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted the
provisions of SFAS123R Share Based Payments
for accounting for stock based compensation, including options
and other awards issued under its stock incentive plan and
shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan. Stock
options issued are valued based upon the Black-Scholes option
pricing model and the Company recognizes this value as an
expense over the periods in which the options vest. Use of the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires that the Company
make certain assumptions, including expected volatility,
forfeiture rate, risk-free interest rate, expected dividend
yield and expected life of the options, based on historical
experience. Volatility is based on historical information with
terms consistent with the expected life of the option. The risk
free interest rate is based on the quoted daily treasury yield
curve rate at the time of grant, with terms consistent with the
expected life of the option. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the
following weighted-average assumptions were used

expense reflects the fair value of stock based awards measured
at grant date, including an estimated forfeiture rate, and is
recognized over the relevant service period. The Company elected
to use the modified prospective transition method and has
applied the provisions of SFASNo123R to new
awards and to awards modified, repurchased or cancelled after
January1, 2006. In accordance with the modified
prospective transition method, the consolidated financial
statements for 2005 have not been restated to reflect, and do
not include, the impact of SFASNo123R.
Stock-based compensation expense recognized under
SFASNo123R during 2007 and 2006 was approximately
$08million and $06million, respectively. In
addition, the Company recognized tax benefits related to the
exercise of stock options of $02million and
$03million. As options and units vest, the Company
expects to recognize approximately $20million in
additional compensation expense as required by
SFASNo123R, including $09million during
2008.   All options granted prior to 2003 were designated as
nonqualified options, with an exercise price equal to or in
excess of fair market value on the date of grant, and for a term
of ten years. For substantially all options granted, fifty
percent of each recipients options will vest on the fourth
anniversary of the date of grant and the remaining 50% will vest
on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant. For options
issued prior to 2004, the vesting schedule will change if,
beginning one year after the option grant date, the stock price
of the common stock reaches the following target levels
measured as a percentage increase over the exercise price for
60 consecutive trading days. During 2007, 12,293 and 400 options

The aggregate intrinsic value is before applicable income taxes
and represents the amount option recipients would have received
if all options had been available to be exercised on the last
trading day of 2007, or December31, 2007, based upon the
Companys closing stock price of $995.   As permitted by SFASNo123 Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by Statement
SFASNo148 Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure,
through December31, 2005, the Company chose to measure
compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation plans
using the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25 Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and to provide the
disclosure only requirements of SFASNo123. Had
compensation costs been recorded on the consolidated statements
of operations, reported net income and earnings per share during
2005 would have been changed to the amount indicated below in
thousands, except per share amounts

granted 18,670, 18,389 and 18,535 restricted shares of common
stock, respectively, to members of senior management as
compensation. The Company did not grant restricted shares of
common stock in 2005. While all of the shares are considered
granted, they are not considered issued or outstanding until
vested. The 2007 and 2006 awards vests 25% on each anniversary
of the grant date. The 2004 award vested 20%, or
3,707shares, upon grant and vests an additional 20% at
each subsequent anniversary date. Since grant, less than 1% of
total shares have been forfeited.   During December 2007, 8,304 restricted shares were issued and
are outstanding. Under the terms of the plan and upon vesting,
the Company authorized a net settlement of distributable shares
to employees after consideration of individual employees
tax withholding obligations, at the election of each employee.
In December 2007, we repurchased 193shares for
approximately $968 per share to cover the participants
tax liability.   As of December31, 2007 and 2006, there were 36,169 and
25,657 unvested shares outstanding, respectively. The shares
awarded had a fair value of $02million, $02million

STATEMENTSContinued   on grant date prices of $1300 for the May 2007 awards, $1221
for the November 2006 awards and $504 for the November 2004
awards. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized
approximately $110,000, $23,000 and $19,000, respectively, in
compensation expense related to these grants, and will record an
additional $04million over the remaining vesting periods.   During the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, 9,234
and 6,288shares of common stock, respectively, were issued
in aggregate to non-management directors as compensation for
service. During 2005, 17,994 options to purchase common stock
and included in the tables above were issued to non-management
directors. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized
compensation expense of approximately $01million each
year. In 2005, the options were issued at an exercise price of
$001, compared to the fair market value of $688 per share on
the date of grant, and were immediately exercised by each of the
recipients.   Employee
Stock Purchase Plan   In 1998, the Company adopted an employee stock purchase plan
the ESPP to assist its employees in acquiring a
stock ownership interest in the Company. Under this ESPP,
300,000shares of common stock were authorized for
purchase, of which 73,508shares remained available at the
time the ESPP terminated on December31, 2007, in
accordance with its terms. During the years ended
December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, 19,246, 22,400 and
31,456shares, respectively, were issued out of the ESPP.
During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded compensation
expense of approximately $18,000, $85,000 and $152,000,
respectively, determined by the difference between the fair
value on the day the shares were issued and cash price paid
under the ESPP for those shares granted prior to January1,
2006. Compensation expense for shares granted subsequent to
January1, 2006, were based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the provisions of
SFASNo123R.   Due to the expiration of the current ESPP and subject to
shareholder approval in May 2008, the Company has adopted the
2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the 2008 ESPP.
The terms of the 2008 ESPP will remain essentially the same as
its predecessor, with 300,000shares of common stock
authorized for purchase. The common stock will be offered during
twenty consecutive six-month periods, the first of which began
on January1, 2008 and will end on June30, 2008.
Thereafter, the purchase periods will begin on the first day and
end on the last day of each subsequent six-month period. The
2008 ESPP will permit eligible employees to purchase common
stock at a discount through payroll deductions, with no employee
purchasing more than $25,000 worth in any calendar year. As
allowed under the 2008 ESPP, a participant may elect to withdraw
from the plan, effective for the purchase period in progress at
the time of the election, with all of the participants
accumulated payroll deductions returned to them at the time of
withdrawal. In the event the 2008 ESPP is not approved by the
shareholders, all participants accumulated payroll deductions
will promptly be returned to them.   Minority
Interest and Operating Partnership Units   As discussed in Note6, the Company is a general partner of
RLHLP and at December31, 2006, the Company held an
approximate 99% interest in that entity. Partners who hold
operating partnership units OPUnits have the
right to put those OPUnits to RLHLP, in which event either
iRLHLP must redeem the units for cash, or iithe
Company, as general partner, may elect to acquire the
OPUnits for cash or in exchange for a like number of
shares of its common stock. At December31, 2007, 44,837
OPUnits held by limited partners were outstanding.   In September 2007 and as a component of the sale of a commercial
office complex discussed in Note3 above, the Company
accepted 97,826 OPUnits held by limited partners for a
fair market value of $927 per share, based upon the trading
price five days before the sale. The redemption resulted in a
non-cash adjustment of the minority interest balance of
$03million and an increase of $06million to
property and equipment as a result of the
step-up in
value of the Companys investment in RLHLP. During the
first quarter of 2006, the Company elected to issue
143,498shares of its common stock in exchange for a like
number of OPUnits that then certain limited partners put
to RLHLP. The exchange resulted in a non-cash adjustment of the
minority interest balance of $22million, with a
corresponding increase to common stock and additional
paid-in-capital.

Operating
Lease Income   The Company leases commercial retail and office space to various
tenants over terms ranging through 2017. The leases generally
provide for fixed minimum monthly rent as well as tenants
payments for their pro rata share of taxes and insurance and
common area maintenance and expenses. Rental income for the
years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, from
continuing operations was approximately $28million
$13million and $20million, respectively, which
included contingent rents of approximately $03million,

Lease Commitments   Total future minimum payments due under all current term

income to be earned annually through 2020. Total rent expense
from continuing operations, net of sublease income under the
leases for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively, was $70million, $70million and
$71million, respectively, which included
$65million, $64million and $66million of
hotel facility and land lease expense, as presented on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.   	
2008     7,971   2009   7,097   2010   7,329   2011   5,646   2012   5,203   Thereafter   36,339     69,585   In 2001, the Company assumed a master lease agreement for 17
hotel properties, including 12 which were part of the Red Lion
acquisition. Subsequently, the Company entered into an agreement
with Doubletree DTWC Corporation whereby Doubletree DTWC
Corporation is subleasing five of these hotel properties from
Red Lion. The master lease agreement requires minimum monthly
payments of $13million plus contingent rents based on
gross receipts from the 17 hotels, of which approximately
$08million per month is paid by a sub-lease tenant. The
lease agreement expires in December 2020, although the Company
has the option to extend the term on a
hotel-by-hotel
basis for three additional five-year terms.   Through June 2007, the Company operated a leased hotel property,
the Red Lion Hotel Sacramento, which is included under the
master lease agreement discussed in the above paragraph. In July
2007, the Company entered into an agreement to turnover
operations and sublease the Red Lion Hotel Sacramento to an
unrelated third party with an initial lease term expiring in
2020. The sublease agreement provides for annual sublease
payments to the Company of $14million, which will
effectively reduce the Companys consolidated annual hotel
facility and land lease expense by that amount. In addition as
part of the agreement, the Company received deferred lease
income of $30million, which will be recognized over the
life of the sublease agreement. For 2006 and through
July25, 2007, the date of transition from an owned/leased
property to a franchise, the Company recorded revenues from the
hotel of $86million and $46million, respectively.   The third-party subleasing the hotel has entered into a
franchise agreement and committed to make a multi-million dollar
investment to further improve and reposition the hotel. As part
of the agreement, the Company committed to $30million in
tenant improvements and as of December31, 2007, had spent
approximately $08million of that amount. Also, the
sublease provides the third party a two-year option to purchase
the property.   As discussed in Note5, in October 2007 the Company
completed an acquisition of a
100-year
including extension periods leasehold interest in a
hotel in Anaheim, California for $83million, including
costs of the acquisition. As required under the terms of the
leasehold agreement, the Company will pay $18million per
year in lease payments through April 2011, the amounts of which
have been reflected in the above table. At the Companys
option, the lease term may be extended for 19 additional terms
of five years each, with the increases in lease payments tied
directly to the Consumer Price Index. Beyond the monthly
payments through April 2011, the Company has not been included
any additional potential further lease commitments related to
the Anaheim property in the table above.

Related-Party
Transactions   The Company conducted various business transactions during 2007,
2006 and 2005 in which the counterparty was considered a related
party due to common ownership by its directors
and/or
shareholders. The nature of the transactions was limited to
performing certain management and administrative functions for
the related entities, commissions for real estate sales, leased
office space and purchased product for use in the hotels and
restaurants from related entities. The total aggregate value of
these transactions in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $03million,
$05million and $03million, respectively.   During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company held certain cash and
investment accounts in a bank and had notes payable to the same
bank. The banks chairman and chief executive officer is a
member of Red Lions board of directors. At
December31, 2007 and 2006, total cash and investments held
were approximately $09million and $05million,
respectively, with outstanding notes payable totaling
approximately $28million and $34million,
respectively. Net interest expense of $02million,
$05million and $02million, respectively, related
to an outstanding note payable to this bank was recorded during
2007, 2006 and 2005. Additionally, up until the sale of the real
estate management business in April 2006, as discussed further
in Note4, the Company managed the banks corporate
office building under the terms of a management agreement.
Aggregate management fees received from this agreement during
2006 and 2005 were approximately $43,000 in 2006 and $127,000 in
2005.

Employee
Defined Contribution Plan   The Company maintains the Red Lion Hotels Corporation Amended
and Restated Retirement and Savings Plan, the Companys
401k plan, to which it and substantially all employees may
contribute. The Company makes contributions of up to 3% of an
employees compensation based on a vesting schedule and
eligibility requirements set forth in the plan document. During
2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company made contributions to the plan
of approximately $04million, $04million and

Business
Segments   As of December31, 2007, the Company had three operating
segments hotels, franchise and management and
entertainment. The other segment consists primarily
of miscellaneous revenues and expenses, cash and cash
equivalents, certain receivables and certain property and
equipment which are not specifically associated with an
operating segment. Management reviews and evaluates the
operating segments exclusive of interest expense; therefore, it
has not been allocated to the segments.   The Company has historically owned certain commercial properties
and has also engaged in traditional real estate related
services, including developing, managing and acting as a broker
for sales and leases of commercial and
multi-unit
residential properties collectively referred to as the real
estate management business. Together, these operations
comprised the real estate segment. Effective April30,
2006, the Company divested the real estate management business.
In addition, consistent with company strategy of divesting
non-core assets, during the fourth quarter of 2006 the Company
listed one of its two remaining wholly-owned commercial real
estate properties for sale and classified its results of
operations within discontinued operations for all periods
presented. As discussed above in Note3, the Company sold
the commercial office building in September 2007. The remaining
operations of that segment have been reclassified to
Other for 2006 and for all comparative periods,
where appropriate.   The franchise and management segment had intra-segment revenues
with the hotels segment for management fees which were
eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Likewise,
the entertainment segment had inter-segment revenues which were
eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Management
reviews and evaluates the operations of all of its segments
including the inter-segment and intra-segment revenues. All
balances have been presented after the elimination of
inter-segment and intra-segment revenues and expenses. Selected

Subsequent
Events   In February 2008, the President and Chief Executive Officer of
the Company, who was also a director, retired. In connection
therewith, the Company entered into a written retirement
agreement with the executive that includes separation payments
and benefits of $22million in value. Under the terms of
the agreement, all of the former executives 545,117 stock
options and 12,990 restricted stock units immediately vested,
resulting in expense of $09million and $01million,
respectively, in 2008. In addition, under the terms of the
retirement agreement, the exercise period for 414,191 of the
options was extended to be exercisable until February 2011 or
until the earlier expiration of their original
10-year
term. The remaining 130,926 stock options will expire in March
2008. The modification to the terms of the previously granted
equity awards resulted in additional stock based compensation
expense of $04million. In total, the Company will
recognize $37million in expense during the first quarter
of 2008.   Also in February 2008, the board of directors granted 5,769
restricted shares of common stock and 52,734 options to purchase
common stock in connection with the appointment of the
Companys new President, Chief Executive Officer and
director.

Controls
and Procedures   Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   As of December31, 2007, we carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer CEO and CFO, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our
management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that
material information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports filed or submitted by us under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within time periods specified in Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and forms.   There were no changes in internal control over financial
reporting, as defined in Exchange Act
Rules13a-15f
and
15d-15f,
during the fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
controls over financial reporting.   Managements
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting   Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over our financial reporting, which is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America.   Because of its inherent limitations, any system of internal
controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed,
may not prevent or detect misstatements due to the possibility
that a control can be circumvented or overridden or that
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur that are not
detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal
control effectiveness may vary over time.   Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, using
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO and concluded that we
have maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2007, based on these criteria.   For purposes of evaluating internal controls over financial
reporting, management determined that the internal controls over
financial reporting of the Anaheim Maingate Hotel, of which Red
Lion Hotels Corporation acquired a leasehold interest in October
2007, would be excluded from the internal control assessment as
of December31, 2007, as permitted by the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In
October 2007, the Company acquired the leasehold interest in the
310-room, full service hotel in Anaheim, California, for
$83million, including costs of the acquisition. During
the fourth quarter of 2007, the Anaheim Maingate Hotel
contributed approximately 07% of the Companys total
revenue during 2007 and accounted for approximately 28% of
total assets at December31, 2007.   Our internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2007, of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007,
have been audited by BDO Seidman, LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in the report which is
included herein.   There have been no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   
82 Table of Contents   Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   Board of Directors and Stockholders   Red Lion Hotels Corporation   Spokane, Washington   We have audited Red Lion Hotels Corporations internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007,
based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria.
Red Lion Hotel Corporations management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, including in the accompanying
Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   As indicated in the accompanying Managements Annual
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting,
managements assessment of and conclusion on the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did
not include the internal controls of the Anaheim Maingate Hotel,
which was acquired in October 2007 and which is included in the
consolidated balance sheets of Red Lion Hotels Corporation as of
December31, 2007, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the
year then ended. The Anaheim Maingate Hotel constituted 28% of
total assets as of December31, 2007, and 07% of total
revenues for the year then ended. Management did not assess the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of
the Anaheim Maingate Hotel because of the timing of the
acquisition which was completed in October 2007. Our audit of
internal control over financial reporting of Red Lion Hotels
Corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal
control over financial reporting of the Anaheim Maingate Hotel.   In our opinion, Red Lion Hotels Corporation maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2007, based on the COSO
criteria.

statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2007 and our report dated March12, 2008
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.   /s/BDO
