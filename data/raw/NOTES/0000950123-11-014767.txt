Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   The Board of Directors and Stockholders   P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company as of January2, 2011 and January3, 2010,
and the related consolidated statements of income, equity, and
cash flows for the years ended January2, 2011,
January3, 2010, and December28, 2008. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of January2, 2011 and January3,
2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for the years ended January2, 2011, January3, 2010,
and December28, 2008, in conformity with
U.S.generally accepted accounting principles.   As discussed in Note1 to the consolidated financial
statements, effective December29, 2008, the Company has
changed its method of accounting and reporting for minority
interests such that they are recharacterized as noncontrolling
interests and classified as a component of equity.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
January2, 2011, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, and our report dated February16, 2011
expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting.   signed KPMG LLP   Phoenix, Arizona   February16, 2011

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   Organization
and Nature of Operations   P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc. the Company or
PFCB operates two restaurant concepts consisting of
restaurants throughout the United States under the names P.F.
Changs China Bistro Bistro and Pei Wei Asian
Diner Pei Wei. The Company was formed in 1996 and
became publicly traded in 1998. Additionally, the Company has
extended its brand to international markets and retail products,
with both businesses operating under licensing agreements.   Fiscal
Year   The Companys fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to the
end of December. Fiscal years 2010 and 2008 were each comprised
of 52weeks and fiscal year 2009 was comprised of
53weeks.   Use of
Estimates   The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting
principles GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.   Principles
of Consolidation and Presentation   The Companys consolidated financial statements include the
accounts and operations of the Company and its majority-owned
subsidiaries. All material balances and transactions between the
consolidated entities have been eliminated. Beginning fiscal
2009, noncontrolling interests previously shown as minority
interest are reported below net income under the heading
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests
in the consolidated statements of income and shown as a
component of equity in the consolidated balance sheets.   Cash
and Cash Equivalents   The Companys cash and cash equivalent balances are not
pledged or restricted. The Companys policy is to invest
cash in excess of operating requirements in income-producing
investments. Income-producing investments with maturities of
three months or less at the time of investment are reflected as
cash equivalents. Amounts receivable from credit card processors
are also considered cash equivalents because they are both
short-term and highly liquid in nature and are typically
converted to cash within three days of the sales transaction.
Cash equivalents as of January2, 2011 and January3,
2010 consisted primarily of money market fund investments and
amounts receivable from credit card processors.   Other
Current Assets   Other current assets consist primarily of receivables, current
portion of deferred tax asset, income taxes receivable and
prepaid rent. Receivables consist primarily of amounts due from
third-party gift card sales and amounts due from landlords for
tenant incentives. Management believes outstanding receivable
amounts to be collectible.   Inventories   Inventories consist of food and beverages and are stated at the
lower of cost or market using the
first-in,
first-out method.

NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Property
and Equipment   Property and equipment is stated at cost, which includes
capitalized interest during the construction and development
period. Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful service lives of
the related assets, which approximate seven years. The
Companys home office building is depreciated on a
straight-line basis over 30years, and building
improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over
20years. Leasehold improvements and buildings under
capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the useful life
of the asset or the length of the related lease term. The term
of the lease includes renewal option periods only in instances
in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably
assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an
economic penalty. China and smallwares are generally depreciated
over two years up to 50percent of their original cost and
replacements are recorded as operating expenses as they are
purchased.   Depreciation
and Amortization   Depreciation and amortization expense included in continuing
operations includes the depreciation and amortization of fixed
assets, gains and losses on disposal of assets and the
amortization of intangible assets, capitalized software costs
and non-transferable liquor license fees and totaled
$775million, $744million and $687million
for the years ended January2, 2011, January3, 2010,
and December28, 2008, respectively.   During the years ended January2, 2011, January3,
2010, and December28, 2008, the Company incurred gross
interest expense of $17million, $31million, and
$48million, respectively. Of these amounts,
$01million, $03million, and $07million,
respectively, were capitalized during the years ended
January2, 2011, January3, 2010, and
December28, 2008.   Goodwill
and Intangible Assets   Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment
tests. Intangible assets deemed to have definite lives are
amortized over their estimated useful lives, which is generally
fifteen years for Bistro restaurants and ten years for Pei Wei
restaurants.   Goodwill   Goodwill represents the residual purchase price after allocation
of the purchase price of assets acquired and relates to the
Companys purchase of interests in various restaurants at
the formation of the Company. Impairment tests are performed
with respect to goodwill at the segment level of reporting. On
an annual basis, the Company reviews the recoverability of
goodwill based primarily on a multiple of earnings analysis
which compares the estimated fair value of the reporting segment
to the carrying value. As a secondary review, the Company also
compares the market value of its common stock to the total
Company carrying value. Generally, the Company performs its
annual assessment for impairment during the fourth quarter of
its fiscal year and performs the analysis more frequently if
there are any impairment indicators identified during the year.
As of January2, 2011, management determined there was no
impairment of goodwill. There can be no assurance that future

Assets   Intangible assets were historically recognized upon the
Companys buyout of noncontrolling interests when the
Companys purchase price exceeded the imputed fair value at
the time of the partners original investment. Beginning
fiscal 2009 upon the adoption of new accounting guidance, an
intangible asset is no longer recognized upon buyout of
noncontrolling interests. Instead, any excess of the
Companys purchase price over the imputed fair value is
recognized as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in
equity.   Impairment

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets
might be impaired, but at least quarterly. An analysis is
performed at the individual restaurant level and primarily
includes an assessment of historical cash flows and other
relevant facts and circumstances. For restaurants open greater
than two years, negative restaurant-level cash flows over the
previous twelve-month period is considered a potential
impairment indicator. In these situations, the Company evaluates
future restaurant cash flow projections in conjunction with
qualitative factors and future operating plans. Based on this
assessment, the Company either acontinues to monitor
these restaurants over the near-term for evidence of improved
performance or bimmediately recognizes an impairment
charge based on the amount by which the asset carrying value
exceeds fair value, which is based on discounted future cash
flows.   In the past, restaurants under monitoring have typically
achieved cash flow improvements in a timely fashion such that no
impairment charge was deemed necessary and the restaurant was
removed from active monitoring. During the year ended
December28, 2008, the Company recognized non-cash asset
impairment charges of $75million $46million net
of tax related to the write-off of the carrying value of the
long-lived assets associated with the closure of ten Pei Wei
stores. See Note 2 for further discussion. No other impairment
of long-lived assets was recognized by the Company during the
year ended December28, 2008. There were no impairments
recognized by the Company during the years ended January2,
2011 and January3, 2010. There can be no assurance that
future impairment tests will not result in additional charges to
earnings.   The Companys impairment assessment process requires the
use of estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and
operating outcomes, which are subject to a significant degree of
judgment based on experience and knowledge. These estimates can
be significantly impacted by changes in the economic
environment, real estate market conditions and overall operating
performance. At any given time, the Company is actively
monitoring a small number of restaurants and impairment charges
could be triggered in the future if individual restaurant
performance does not improve or if management decides to close
that location. Also, if current economic conditions worsen,
additional restaurants could be placed on active monitoring and
potentially trigger impairment charges in future periods.   Other
Assets   Other assets consist primarily of transferable and
nontransferable liquor licenses, capitalized software costs,
receivable under loan facility to True Food Kitchen, Restoration
Plan assets see Note14 for additional information and
vendor deposits. Nontransferable liquor licenses are amortized
over the life of the restaurant twenty years for Bistro and
fifteen years for Pei Wei and trademarks are amortized over the
shorter of the useful life of the asset or the length of the
related contract term. The term of the lease or contract
includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the
exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and
failure to exercise such option would result in an economic
penalty. Capitalized software costs are typically amortized over
five years. See Note6 for additional details on the
Companys other assets.   Accrued
Insurance   The Company is self-insured for certain exposures, principally
workers compensation, general liability, medical and
dental, for the first $100,000, $250,000, $275,000 or $500,000
of individual claims depending on the type of claim. The Company
has paid amounts to its insurance carrier or claims
administrator that approximate the cost of claims known to date
and has accrued additional liabilities for its estimate of
ultimate costs related to those claims, including known claims
and an actuarially determined estimate of incurred but not yet
reported claims. In developing these estimates, the Company uses
historical experience factors to estimate the ultimate claim
exposure. The Companys self insurance liabilities are
actuarially determined and consider estimates of expected
losses, based on statistical analyses of the Companys
actual historical trends as well as historical industry data. It
is reasonably possible that future adjustments to these
estimates will be required.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Lease
Obligations   The Company leases all of its restaurant properties. At the
inception of the lease, each property is evaluated to determine
whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or
capital lease. The lease term includes renewal option periods
only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option
can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option
would result in an economic penalty.   Tenant incentives received from landlords in connection with
certain of the Companys operating leases are recorded as a
deferred rent liability within lease obligations and are
amortized over the relevant lease term. For leases that contain
scheduled rent escalations, the Company recognizes rent expense
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The
straight-line rent calculation includes the rent holiday period,
which begins on the possession date and ends on the store open
date.   Many of the Companys leases contain provisions that
require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales
volume contingent rent. Contingent rent is
recognized as rent expense in the period incurred.   Other
Liabilities   Other liabilities include the Companys net long-term
deferred tax liabilities, performance units, liabilities related
to the Restoration Plan discussed further in Note14,
cash-settled awards and asset retirement obligations
ARO. See Note12 for further details of the
Companys other liabilities.   The Companys AROs are primarily associated with certain of
the Companys restaurant leases under which the landlord
has the option to require the Company to remove its leasehold
improvements at the end of the lease term and return the
property to the landlord in its original condition. The Company
estimates the fair value of these liabilities based on estimated
store closing costs, accretes that current cost forward to the
date of estimated ARO removal and discounts the future cost back
as if it were performed at the inception of the lease. At the
inception of such a lease, the Company records the ARO liability
and also records a related capital asset in an amount equal to
the estimated fair value of the liability. The ARO liability is
accreted to its future value, with accretion expense recognized
as interest and other income, net, and the capitalized asset is
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the
asset, which is generally the life of the leasehold improvement.
The estimate of the conditional asset retirement liability is
based on a number of assumptions requiring managements
judgment, including the cost to return the space to its original
condition, inflation rates and discount rates. As a result, in
future periods the Company may make adjustments to the ARO
liability as a result of the availability of new information,
changes in estimated costs, inflation rates and other factors.   Unearned
Revenue   The Company sells gift cards to customers in its restaurants,
through its websites and via other retail outlets. Unearned
revenue represents gift cards sold for which revenue recognition
criteria, generally redemption, has not been met. These amounts
are presented net of any discounts issued by the Company in
connection with the terms of its third-party gift card
distribution agreements.   Revenue
Recognition   Revenues from food, beverage and alcohol sales are recognized as
products are sold.   The Company recognizes income from gift cards when: ithe
gift card is redeemed by the customer; or iithe
likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is
remote gift card breakage and the Company determines there is
no legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards
to the relevant jurisdictions. The Company determines the gift
card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns.
Gift card breakage income was not significant in any fiscal year
and is reported within revenues in the consolidated statements
of income.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Initial territory fees received pursuant to international
development and licensing agreements are recognized as revenue
when the Company has performed its material obligations under
the agreement, which is typically after the opening of a certain
number of restaurants within the territory. Store opening fees
are recognized as revenue when the Company has substantially
performed its obligations to assist the licensee in opening a
new restaurant, which is generally at the time such restaurant
opens for business. Ongoing royalty fees from licensed
restaurants are based on a percentage of restaurant sales and
are recognized as revenue in the period the related
restaurants revenues are earned.   Ongoing royalty fees from licensed retail products are based on
a percentage of product sales and are recognized as revenue upon
the sale of the product to retail outlets.   Advertising   The Company expenses advertising production costs at the time
the advertising first takes place. All other advertising costs
are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense for the years
ended January2, 2011, January3, 2010, and
December28, 2008 was $125million,
$104million, and $92million, respectively.   Partner
Bonus Expense, Imputed   Partner bonus expense, imputed, which is classified within labor
expense in the consolidated statements of income, represents the
portion of restaurant-level operating results that is allocable
to certain noncontrolling partners, but is presented as bonus
expense for accounting purposes. Specifically, given that
employees who choose to invest as partners are not eligible to
participate in restaurant-level bonus programs, a portion of
their partnership earnings that would otherwise be presented as
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is deemed to
be a bonus expense for financial reporting purposes. The amounts
imputed are based on existing bonus programs used by the Company
for non-investing employees based on individual restaurant-level
operating results. Partner bonus expense, imputed for the years
ended January2, 2011, January3, 2010, and
December28, 2008 was $04million, $05million,
and $09million, respectively.   Preopening
Expense   Preopening expense, consisting primarily of manager salaries,
employee payroll and related training costs incurred prior to
the opening of a restaurant, is expensed as incurred. Preopening
expense also includes the accrual for straight-line rent
recorded during the period between date of possession and the
restaurant opening date for the Companys leased restaurant
locations.   Partner
Investment Expense   Partner investment expense represents the difference between the
imputed fair value of noncontrolling interests at the time the
partners invest in their restaurants and the partners cash
capital contribution for these ownership interests.
Additionally, for those interests that are bought out prior to
the restaurant reaching maturity typically after five years of
operation, partner investment expense includes a reversal of
previously recognized expense for the difference between the
fair value of the noncontrolling interest at inception date and
the fair value at the date of repurchase, to the extent that the
former is greater. Partner investment expense is no longer
recognized for new Bistro openings since the beginning of fiscal
2007 and for new Pei Wei openings since April 2010 due to
changes in the partnership structure see Note16 for
further details.   Consolidated partner investment expense for the years ended
January2, 2011, January3, 2010, and
December28, 2008 was a net benefit of $03million,
$06million and $04million, respectively. See

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Taxes   The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for
income taxes in which deferred taxes are determined based on the
difference between the financial statement and tax basis of
assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which the differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The Company recognizes
deferred tax assets when future realization is considered by
management to be more likely than not.   The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to
uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
See Note17 for further discussion of the Companys
uncertain tax positions.   Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests relating to
the income or loss of consolidated partnerships includes no
provision for income taxes as any tax liability related thereto
is the responsibility of the individual noncontrolling interest
partners.   Sales taxes collected from guests are excluded from revenues.
The obligation is included in accrued expenses until the taxes
are remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities.   Share-Based
Compensation   The Company has granted equity-classified and
liability-classified awards to certain of its employees and
directors and accounts for the awards based on fair value
measurement guidance. The estimated fair value of share-based
compensation is amortized to expense over the vesting period.
See Note13 for further discussion of specific accounting
for share-based compensation.   Income
from Continuing Operations Attributable to PFCB per
Share   Basic income from continuing operations attributable to PFCB per
share is computed based on the weighted average of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted income from continuing
operations attributable to PFCB per share is computed based on
the weighted average number of shares of common stock and
potentially dilutive securities, which includes options,
restricted stock and restricted stock units RSUs
outstanding under the Companys equity plans and employee
stock purchase plan. For the years ended January2, 2011,
January3, 2010, and December28, 2008,

its shareholders during fiscal 2010. The Companys
restricted stock awards are considered participating securities
as the awards include non-forfeitable rights to dividends with
respect to unvested shares and, as such, must be included in the
computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class
method. Under the two-class method, a portion of net income is
allocated to participating securities, and therefore is excluded
from the calculation of earnings per share allocated to common
shares. For the year ended January2, 2011, the calculation
of basic and diluted earnings per share pursuant to the
two-class method resulted in an immaterial difference from the
amounts displayed in the consolidated statements of income.   Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, receivables,
accounts payable, and accrued expenses is deemed to approximate
fair value due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these
financial instruments. The fair value of long-term debt
approximates the carrying value due to the Companys right
to repay outstanding balances at any time.   Concentrations
of Credit Risk   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of
cash investments and receivables. The Company maintains cash and
cash equivalents, funds on deposit and certain other financial
instruments with financial institutions that are considered in
the Companys investment strategy. Concentrations of credit
risk with respect to receivables are limited as the
Companys receivables are primarily related to third-party
gift card sales, tenant incentives from landlords and a
long-term receivable under the loan facility to True Food
Kitchen.   Derivatives   All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair
value as liabilities. The fair value of the Companys
derivative financial instruments is determined using either
market quotes or valuation models that are based upon the net
present value of estimated future cash flows and incorporate
current market data inputs. The Company

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   reports its derivative liabilities in accrued expenses. The
accounting for the change in the fair value of a derivative
financial instrument depends on its intended use and the
resulting hedge designation, if any, as discussed below.   A cash flow hedge is a derivative designed to hedge the exposure
of variable future cash flows that is attributable to a
particular risk associated with an existing recognized asset or
liability, or a forecasted transaction. The Company utilizes the
hypothetical derivative method to measure hedge effectiveness.
For derivative financial instruments that qualify as cash flow
hedges, the effective portions of the gain or loss on the
derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
loss income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged
cash flows are recognized in earnings. The amount that is
reclassified into earnings, as well as any ineffective portion
of the gain or loss, as determined by the accounting
requirements, are reported as a component of interest and other
income expense. If a hedge is de-designated or terminated
prior to maturity, the amount previously recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive loss income is recognized in earnings over
the period that the hedged item impacts earnings. If a hedge
relationship is discontinued because it is probable that a
forecasted transaction will not occur according to the original
strategy, any related amounts previously recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive loss income are recognized in earnings
immediately.   During the second quarter of 2008, the Company hedged a portion
of its existing long-term variable-rate debt through the use of
an interest rate swap. This derivative instrument effectively
fixed the interest expense on a portion of the Companys
long-term debt for the duration of the swap. The interest rate
swap expired on May20, 2010. There was no hedge
ineffectiveness recognized during the periods ended
January2, 2011, and January3, 2010. See Note8

Credit
Facility   On August31, 2007, the Company entered into a senior
credit facility Credit Facility with several
commercial financial institutions, which allowed for borrowings
of up to $1500million. On December15, 2009, the
Company amended the Credit Facility which reduced the borrowings
allowed to $750million and modified certain restrictive
language regarding restricted payments such as dividends and
share repurchases. The Credit Facility expires on

warranties, negative and affirmative covenants, including a
requirement to maintain a maximum leverage ratio, as defined, of
25:1 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined, of
125:1, as well as customary events of default and certain
default provisions that could result in acceleration of the
Credit Facility.   The Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Companys material
existing and future domestic subsidiaries. As of January2,
2011, the Company had $172million committed for the
issuance of letters of credit, which are required by insurance

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Interest
Rate Swap   During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company entered
into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of
$400million. The purpose of this transaction was to
provide a hedge against the effects of changes in interest rates
on a portion of the Companys current variable rate
borrowings. The Company designated the interest rate swap as a
cash flow hedge of its exposure to variability in future cash
flows attributable to interest payments on a $400million
tranche of floating rate debt.   Under the terms of the interest rate swap, the Company paid a
fixed rate of 332% on the $400million notional amount
and received payments from its counterparty based on the
one-month LIBOR rate for a term which ended when the interest
rate swap expired on May20, 2010. Interest rate
differentials paid or received under the swap agreement were
recognized as adjustments to interest expense.

invested primarily in government-backed securities at
January2, 2011.   The Companys Restoration Plan investments are considered

participants contributions to the Plan invested in trading

participants realized and unrealized holding gains and
losses on their Restoration Plan investments are considered
compensation expense and are recorded in general and
administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income.   The fair value of the Companys interest rate swap was
estimated using the net present value of a series of cash flows
on both the fixed and floating legs of the swap and was
reflected within accrued expenses in the consolidated balance
sheets. These cash flows were based on yield curves which took
into account the contractual terms of the derivative, including
the period to maturity and market-based parameters such as
interest rates and volatility. The yield curves used in the
valuation model were based on published data for counterparties
with an AA rating. Market practice in pricing derivatives
initially assumes all counterparties have the same credit
quality. The Company mitigated derivative credit risk by
transacting with highly rated counterparties. The interest rate
swap expired on May20, 2010. See Note8 for a

STATEMENTSContinued   incorporates the historical performance, volatility and
correlation of the Companys stock price and the Russell
2000 Index. At January2, 2011 and January3, 2010,
the performance unit liability, reflected in other liabilities
in the consolidated balance sheets, was $58million and
$24million, respectively. There were no performance unit
awards granted during fiscal 2010.   Total cumulative expense recognized for the performance units
from date of grant through January2, 2011 was
$58million based on the current estimated fair values of
$830 and $641 per unit. If the value of the performance units
at settlement date is the maximum value per unit, the Company
would recognize additional share-based compensation expense of
$71million during fiscal 2011. The amount and timing of
the recognition of additional expense will be dependent on the
estimated fair value at each quarterly reporting date. Any
increases in fair value may not occur ratably over the remaining
four quarters of the award term; therefore, share-based
compensation expense related to the performance units could vary
significantly in future periods.   Cash-Settled
Awards   During fiscal 2010 and 2009, the Company granted RCUs to
eligible employees as well as SARs and RCUs to members of its
Board of Directors. The SARs and RCUs issued to the Board of
Directors in fiscal 2010 and 2009 vest over the service period
of one year and, at the election of each applicable director,
the settlement date of RCUs was deferred until the earlier of
the date
he/she
ceases serving on the Companys Board of Directors or a
change in control of the Company. The RCUs granted to employees
vest three years after the date of grant.   The cash value of the SARs will be based on the appreciation, if
any, of the Companys stock price on the date of
settlement. The cash value of the RCUs will be based on the
Companys stock price on the date of settlement. The fair
value of SARs is equal to the value calculated per the
Black-Scholes model and the fair value of RCUs is equal to the
sum of the value calculated per the Black-Scholes model and the
Companys stock price at the reporting date. The fair value
of SARs and RCUs is remeasured at each reporting period until
the awards are settled. At January2, 2011 and
January3, 2010, the recorded liability of cash-settled
awards, reflected in other liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheets, was $46million and $15million,
respectively.   The fair value of the SARs and RCUs was estimated using a

Stock Purchase Plan   During 1998, the Companys Board of Directors approved the
1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Purchase Plan
and reserved 800,000shares for issuance thereunder. The
Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common
stock at a discount, but only through payroll deductions, during
concurrent
24-month
offering periods. Each offering period was originally divided
into four consecutive six-month purchase periods. In August
2007, the Company modified the terms of its Purchase Plan such
that the price at which stock is purchased is equal to
95percent of the fair market value of the common stock on
the last day of the offering period. As a result, the
Companys Purchase Plan is not considered compensatory and
therefore, the Company does not recognize share-based
compensation expense associated with the Purchase Plan. In
November 2009, the Company modified the terms of its Purchase
Plan such that each offering period is divided into eight
consecutive three-month purchase periods.   Share
Repurchase Program   Under current and previous share repurchase programs authorized
by the Companys Board of Directors, the Company has
repurchased a total of 60million shares of its common
stock for $1871million at an average price of $3132
since July 2006. Included in this total are 09million
shares of the Companys common stock repurchased during
fiscal 2010 for $411million at an average price of $4522
using cash on hand. $03million of the amount repurchased
during fiscal 2010 relates to shares that were repurchased under
the previous share repurchase program that expired
December31, 2009 but did not settle until after
January3, 2010.   At January2, 2011, there remains $592million

STATEMENTSContinued   Participants may contribute to the Plan, subject to Internal
Revenue Code restrictions, and the Plan permits the Company to
make discretionary matching contributions. Beginning
July1, 2007, the Company began bi-weekly matching
contributions in amounts equal to 25% of the first 6% of
employee compensation contributed, resulting in a maximum
contribution of 15% of participating employee compensation per
year subject to annual dollar maximum limits. Company match
contributions to the Plan commence after one year of service and
a minimum of 1,000hours worked. Matching contributions
vest at the rate of 20% each year beginning after the
employees second year of service. For the fiscal years
ended January2, 2011, January3, 2010 and
December28, 2008, the Companys matching contribution
expense under the Plan was $04million, $05million
and $06million, respectively.   Restoration
Plan   Effective July1, 2007, the Company adopted a Restoration
Plan, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan which allows
officers and highly compensated employees with six months of
service to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation and
contribute such amounts to one or more investment funds. The
maximum aggregate amount deferrable under the Restoration Plan
is 75% of base salary and 100% of cash incentive compensation.
The Company makes bi-weekly matching contributions in an amount
equal to 25% of the first 6% of employee compensation
contributed, with a maximum annual Company contribution of 15%
of employee compensation per year subject to annual dollar
maximum limits. Company match contributions to the Restoration
Plan commence after one year of service and a minimum of
1,000hours worked. Matching contributions vest at the rate

January3, 2010 and December28, 2008, the
Companys matching contribution expense under the
Restoration Plan was $02million each year.   Additionally, the Company entered into a rabbi trust agreement
to protect the assets of the Restoration Plan. Each
participants account is comprised of their contribution,
the Companys matching contribution and their share of
earnings or losses in the Restoration Plan. The Company
purchased life insurance contracts covering certain participants
in the Restoration Plan. The Company is the sole owner and
beneficiary of these policies. The policies were purchased to
offset a portion of the obligations under the Restoration Plan.
The accounts of the rabbi trust are reported in the
Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company
reports these investments within other assets and the related
obligation within other liabilities on the consolidated balance
sheet. Such amounts totaled $51million and

2010, respectively, within other assets, and totaled
$49million and $32million at January2, 2011

12million liability-classified awards were affected by
these agreements, all of which were unvested.   In December 2008, the former President of Pei Wei Asian Diner,
Inc. resigned his position with the Company and the Company
entered into a separation agreement. According to the terms of
the agreement, the Company paid severance compensation and
accelerated the vesting of approximately 71,000 unvested stock

Partnership
Structure   The Company utilizes a partnership philosophy to facilitate the
development, leadership and operation of its restaurants.
Historically, this philosophy had been embodied in a traditional
legal partnership structure, which included capital
contributions from partners in exchange for an ownership stake
in the profits and losses of the Companys restaurants.
Each partner was required to make a capital contribution in
exchange for their percentage interest in the restaurant or
region the partner managed. The ownership interest purchased by
each partner generally ranged between two and ten percent of the
restaurant or region the partner oversaw. At the end of a
specific term generally five years, the Company has the right,
but not the obligation, to purchase the noncontrolling interest
in the partners respective restaurant or region at fair
market value. An estimated fair value is determined by reference
to current industry purchase metrics as well as the historical
cash flows or net income of the subject restaurant or region, as
appropriate. The Company has the option to pay the agreed upon
purchase price in cash over a period of time not to exceed five
years.   Effective the beginning of fiscal 2007 for new restaurant
openings at the Bistro and effective April 2010 for new
restaurant openings at Pei Wei, a different partnership
structure was employed to achieve the same goal. At the
restaurant level, our partners at stores opened on or after the
effective dates still partners in the
philosophical, but not legal, sense no longer have a direct
ownership stake in the profits and losses of restaurants, but
are instead eligible to receive monthly incentive payments based
upon the profitability of the restaurants in their region, as
well as participate in an incentive program that rewards
improvements in the operating performance of the restaurants in
their market or region.   As a result of these changes, incentive payments made to the
individuals participating in the new plan are classified as
compensation expense rather than as net income attributable to
noncontrolling interests. Accordingly, in the consolidated
statements of income, compensation expense for our Operating and
Culinary Partners is reflected as labor expense and for our
Market Partners, Regional Vice Presidents and Bistro Market
Chefs as general and administrative expense.   Partner investment expense has no longer been recognized for new
Bistro restaurant openings since the beginning of fiscal 2007
and for new Pei Wei restaurant openings since April 2010 as a
result of this change. However, for those partners who are
bought out prior to the restaurant reaching maturity typically
after five years of operation, partner investment expense
includes a reversal of previously recognized expense for the
difference between the fair value of the partners interest
at inception date and the fair value at the date of repurchase,
to the extent that the former is greater.   The following is a summary of partnership activity dollars in

it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. Realization is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income or the
reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which
those temporary differences become deductible. The Company
considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities,
projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in
making this assessment.   The Company currently files tax returns on a consolidated basis
in some states and on a stand-alone basis in others. At
January2, 2011 and January3, 2010, the Company had
deferred tax assets totaling $11million and
$09million, respectively, related to state net operating
loss carryforwards in certain states where stand-alone tax
returns are filed. These losses expire over the next five to
twenty years. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance to
offset the deferred tax assets for those losses that the Company
does not anticipate being able to utilize prior to their
expiration.   At January2, 2011 and January3, 2010, the Company
took advantage of additional tax deductions available relating
to the exercise of non-qualified stock options and disqualifying
dispositions of incentive stock options. Accordingly, for the
years ended January2, 2011 and January3, 2010, the
Company recorded a $26million and $17million,
respectively, increase to equity with a corresponding reduction
to income tax liability. Additionally, at January2, 2011
and January3, 2010, the Company reversed $03million
and $04million, respectively, of deferred tax assets
related to fully vested canceled options for which the Company
will not receive a tax benefit. Quarterly adjustments for the
exercise of non-qualified stock options and disqualifying
dispositions of incentive stock options may vary as they relate
to the actions of the option holder or shareholder.   The reserve for uncertain tax positions was $08million
and $12million, respectively, at January2, 2011 and
January3, 2010. This balance is the Companys best
estimate of the potential liability for uncertain tax positions.
The decrease in the uncertain tax position reserve was primarily
due to audit assessments that settled during 2010. This decrease

various states ranging from the 2002 through 2009 tax years. The
federal statute of limitations is currently open for the 2004

Revenue Service Audit   In March 2010, the Internal Revenue Service IRS
commenced an audit of the Companys federal income tax
returns for fiscal years 2004 through 2009 and refund claims for
fiscal years 2004 through 2006. The final audit results are
subject to approval by the U.S.Congress Joint Committee on
Taxation. To date, the IRS has not issued any notices of
proposed adjustments. Additionally, the Company expects to
resolve this audit by the end of fiscal 2011. Although the
Company believes its tax accruals to be reasonable, the final
determination of the audit and any related litigation could be
materially different from the Companys historical income
tax provisions and accruals.

primarily to commodities contracts and construction for
restaurants planned to open in the near future. At
January2, 2011, such purchase obligations approximated
$1626 million and were due within the following twelve-month
period.   Litigation
and Other   In addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary
course of business, the Company is subject to various claims and
legal actions arising out of the normal conduct of business. The
Company assesses contingencies to determine the degree of
probability and range of possible loss for potential accrual in
its financial statements. An estimated loss contingency is
accrued in the financial statements if it is probable that a
liability has been incurred

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because
litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable
resolutions could occur, assessing contingencies is highly
subjective and requires judgments about future events. The
Company regularly reviews contingencies to determine the
adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures. The amount of
ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. The Company is
also currently under examination by various taxing authorities
for years not closed by the statute of limitations. Although the
Company believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will
not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations,
liquidity or financial position of the Company, it is possible
that the results of operations, liquidity, or financial position
of the Company could be materially affected in any particular
period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these
contingencies.   Loan
Facility   During 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with FRC
Balance LLC FRC, d/b/a True Food Kitchen, to
provide debt capital for the early-stage development of True
Food Kitchen restaurants. The agreement provides for a
$100million loan facility to develop True Food Kitchen
restaurants and can, under certain conditions, be converted by
the Company into a majority equity position in FRC. As of
January2, 2011, the Company had advanced $52million
under the loan facility to fund construction of two new
restaurants which opened during fiscal 2010 and to fund the
initial stages of construction for one restaurant scheduled to
open during fiscal 2011.   The Company has the right, but not the obligation, to convert
the principal amount outstanding under the loan facility to a
majority position in FRC either: aon the earlier of
1the fifth anniversary of the loan facility agreement or
290 to 180days after the opening of the sixth True
Food Kitchen restaurant or bat any time under mutual
agreement between the Company and FRC. If the loan facility is
converted into a majority position, the Company will own 51% of
FRC, at which time the Company will enter into a management
agreement with FRC where FRC will continue the
day-to-day
management of the True Food Kitchen restaurants.   Management has evaluated both quantitative and qualitative
factors regarding the terms of the agreement with FRC including,
but not limited to, voting rights, obligations to absorb
expected losses and rights to receive expected residual returns.
Based on this assessment, management has determined that FRC
does not currently need to be consolidated within the
Companys financial statements. If the Company exercises
its right to convert the principal amount outstanding, the
Company will re-evaluate whether FRC needs to be consolidated
within the Companys financial statements at that time.

Segment
Reporting   The Company operates primarily in the United States food-service
industry and has determined that its reportable segments are
those that are based on the Companys methods of internal
reporting and management structure. The Companys
reportable segments are Bistro and Pei Wei. Additionally,
revenues related to Bistro restaurants operated by business
partners pursuant to development and licensing agreements and
licensing fees related to a premium line of frozen entres
operated under a licensing agreement are both reported within
Shared Services and Other. There were no material transactions
among reportable segments.

Companys financial results, a primary measure used by
executive management in assessing the performance of existing
restaurant concepts is segment profitability sometimes referred
to as restaurant operating income. Segment profitability is
defined as income from operations before general and
administrative, preopening and partner investment expenses, but
including a deduction for net income attributable to
noncontrolling interests. Because preopening and partner
investment expenses are associated with expansion of the
Companys business and vary in timing and magnitude, they
make an accurate assessment of ongoing operations more difficult
and are therefore excluded. Additionally, general and
administrative expenses are only included in the Companys
consolidated financial results as they are generally not
specifically identifiable to individual business units as these
costs relate to support of both restaurant businesses and the
extension of the Companys brands into international
markets and retail products. As the Companys expansion is
funded entirely from its ongoing restaurant operations, segment
profitability is one consideration when determining whether and
when to open additional restaurants.

the audited consolidated financial statements and includes all

adjustments that management considers necessary for a fair
presentation of the unaudited quarterly results when read in
conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and

Subsequent
Events   Cash
Dividends   In February 2010, the Board of Directors approved the
initiation of a quarterly variable cash dividend based on the
Companys desire to consistently return excess cash flow to
its shareholders. The amount of the cash dividend is calculated
based on 45% of the Companys quarterly net income. Based
on seasonal fluctuations in the Companys quarterly net
income, the amount of cash dividend payments may fluctuate
between quarters.   Based on the Board of Directors authorization, on
February16, 2011 the Company announced a cash dividend of
$029 per share which will be paid March14, 2011 to all
shareholders of record at the close of business on
February28, 2011. Based on shares outstanding at
February11, 2011, the total dividend payment will
approximate $66million during the first quarter of fiscal
2011.

Controls
and Procedures   Disclosure Controls and Procedures We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the
Companys reports under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our Co-Chief Executive Officers Co-CEOs
and Chief Financial Officer CFO, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognized that any controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
objectives, as the Companys controls are designed to do,
and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in
evaluating the risk related to controls and procedures.   In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on
Form10-K,
as of January2, 2011, an evaluation was performed under
the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officers and principal
financial officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures, as
such term is defined under
Rule13a-15e
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended the Exchange Act. Based on this
evaluation, our principal executive officers and principal
financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by
this report. This conclusion was communicated to the Audit
Committee.   Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule13a-15f
under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed
to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management
and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements. All internal
control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent
limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and presentation.   Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of January2, 2011. In
making its assessment of internal control over financial
reporting, management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the
Treadway Commission in Internal Control
Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, our Co-CEOs
and CFO concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of January2, 2011 based on the
criteria set forth by COSO in Internal Control
Integrated Framework.   Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has
issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting. This report appears below.   Change in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting There have been no changes in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the Companys last fiscal quarter that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. These
conclusions were communicated to the Audit Committee.
