Financial Statement Schedule:
Schedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts        51 All other schedules are omitted as not applicable under the rules of Regulation S-X.                    23             INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT The McClatchy Company   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The
McClatchy Company and its subsidiaries as of December 26, 1999 and December 27,
1998, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and
stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended December
26, 1999. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the Index to Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedules at Item 8.
These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of The McClatchy Company and its
subsidiaries at December 26, 1999 and December 27, 1998, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 26, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein. Deloitte & Touche LLP

See notes to consolidated financial statements                    29 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The McClatchy Company the Company and its subsidiaries are engaged
primarily in the publication of newspapers located in Minnesota, California, the
Northwest Washington and Alaska and the Carolinas.
The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its
subsidiaries. Significant inter-company items and transactions are eliminated.
In preparing the financial statements, management makes estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fiscal year-end - In 1998, the Company changed from a calendar year to a
fiscal year ending on the Sunday nearest December 31. Accordingly, the
Company results are reported through December 26 and 27 in 1999 and 1998,
respectively, and December 31, 1997.
Revenue recognition - Advertising revenues are recorded when advertisements
are placed in the newspaper and circulation revenues are recorded as newspapers
are delivered over the subscription term. Unearned revenues represent prepaid
circulation subscriptions.
Cash equivalents are highly liquid debt investments with maturities of
three months or less when acquired.
Concentrations of credit risks - Financial instruments which potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risks are principally cash and
cash equivalents and trade accounts receivables. Cash and cash equivalents are
placed with major financial institutions. Accounts receivable are with
customers located primarily in the immediate area of each city of publication.
The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of significant customers
and this assessment, combined with the large number and geographic diversity of
its customers, limits the Company concentration of risk with respect to trade
accounts receivable.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost based principally on the
first-in, first-out method or current market value. See note 3 for a
discussion of a change in the method of accounting for newsprint inventory.
Related party transactions - The Company owns a 135% interest in Ponderay
Newsprint Company Ponderay which owns and operates a newsprint mill in the
State of Washington. The investment is accounted for using the equity method,
under which the Company share of earnings of Ponderay is reflected in income
as earned. The Company guarantees certain bank debt used to construct the mill
see note 9 and is required to purchase 28,400 metric tons of annual production
on
30 a take-if-tendered basis until the debt is repaid. The Company satisfies
this obligation by direct purchase 1999: $14,055,000, 1998: $16,732,000, and
1997: $18,221,000 or reallocation to other buyers.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Major renewals and
betterments, as well as interest incurred during construction, are capitalized.
Depreciation is computed generally on a straight-line basis over estimated
useful lives of:
- 10 to 60 years for buildings
- 9 to 25 years for presses
- 3 to 15 years for other equipment
Intangibles consist of the unamortized excess of the cost of acquiring
newspaper operations over the fair values of the newspapers' tangible assets at
the date of purchase. Identifiable intangible assets, consisting primarily of
lists of advertisers and subscribers, covenants not to compete and commercial
printing contracts, are amortized over three to forty years. The excess of
purchase prices over identifiable assets is amortized over forty years.
Management periodically evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets by
reviewing the current and projected cash flows of each of its newspaper
operations.
Stock-based compensation - The Company accounts for stock-based awards to
employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between amounts of
assets and liabilities reported for financial and income tax reporting purposes.
See note 5.
Comprehensive income - The Company has no changes in its net assets during
any period presented from non-owner sources. Hence, comprehensive income is
equal to net income.
Segment reporting - The Company primary business is the publication of
newspapers. The Company aggregates its newspapers into a single segment because
each has similar economic characteristics, products, customers and distribution
methods.
Earnings per share EPS - Basic EPS excludes dilution and reflects income
divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted average number of outstanding
shares of common stock and dilutive common stock equivalents stock options equivalents calculated using the treasury stock method, no adjustment to net
income required in the period. See note 10.
NOTE 2.  MERGER WITH COWLES MEDIA COMPANY
On March 19, 1998 the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of
Cowles Media Company Cowles in a transaction valued at approximately $9050
per Cowles share and the assumption of $77,350,000 in existing Cowles debt.
Cowles publishes the Star Tribune newspaper                    31 which serves the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Cowles also owned four
separate subsidiaries that publish business magazines, special-interest
magazines and home improvement books. Simultaneously with the close of the
merger, the Company sold the magazine and book publishing subsidiaries. The
combined proceeds, plus debt and other liabilities assumed by the buyers in
those transactions, were $2081 million. These proceeds were used to repay debt
associated with the Cowles merger.
In connection with the Cowles merger, the Company paid 15% of the
consideration by issuing 6,330,548 shares of Class A Common Stock in exchange
for Cowles shares and paid cash for the remaining shares. The Class A shares
were exchanged using a ratio of 301667 shares of McClatchy Class A Common for
each Cowles share. The Company incurred bank debt through a syndicate of banks
and financial institutions to finance the cash requirements of the merger and to
refinance its existing debt see note 4. Results of the Star Tribune have been
included in the Company results beginning March 20, 1998.
The non-newspaper businesses were valued at fair market value based upon
the net after-tax proceeds received by the Company on March 19, 1998, and
accordingly, no gain or loss was realized on the sale.
The merger was accounted for as a purchase, and accordingly, assets
acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their fair market values.
Assets retained by the Company include approximately $55,319,000 of current
assets, $143,978,000 of property, plant and equipment, $1,166,400,000 of
intangible assets and $63,267,000 of other assets. Intangible assets include
approximately $929,000,000 of goodwill which is being amortized over 40 years.
In addition to assuming Cowles' long-term debt, a total of $214,197,000 of
deferred taxes and other liabilities were assumed.
The following table summarizes, on an unaudited pro forma basis, the
combined results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries for the years
ended December 27, 1998 and December 31, 1997, as though the Cowles merger had

incurred significant investment banking, legal and other costs associated with
the transaction in the first quarter of 1998, contributing to the dilution in
the pro forma results for the year ended December 27, 1998.
32 NOTE 3.  CHANGE IN METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR NEWSPRINT
INVENTORY
The Company has accounted for newsprint inventories by the first-in, first-
out FIFO method beginning January 1, 1998, whereas in all prior years
inventories were valued using the last-in, first-out LIFO method. The new
method of accounting for newsprint inventory was adopted to provide for a better
matching of revenues and expenses. Additionally, the change will enable the
financial reporting to parallel the way management assesses the financial and
operational performance of its newspapers. The financial statements of prior
years have been restated to apply the new method retroactively, and accordingly,
retained earnings as of December 31, 1996 have been increased by $1,953,000 to
reflect the restatement. The effect of the accounting change on net income as
previously reported for the year ended December 31, 1997 is as follows in
thousands                          
Net income as previously reported         $68,799
Adjustment for effect of change in
accounting for newsprint
inventories applied retroactively          433
Net income as adjusted              $69,232
The adjustment resulted in an increase of $001 to basic and diluted net
income per share in 1997.
NOTE 4.  LONG-TERM BANK DEBT AND OTHER LONG-TERM
OBLIGATIONS
The Company entered into a bank credit agreement Credit Agreement with a
syndicate of banks and financial institutions providing for borrowings of up to
$1,265,000,000 to finance the Cowles merger and refinance its existing debt.
The Credit Agreement includes term loans consisting of Tranche A of $735,000,000
bearing interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus 125 basis
points in 1998 and 625 basis points in 1999, payable in increasing quarterly
installments from June 30, 1998 through March 31, 2005, and Tranche B of
$330,000,000 bearing interest at LIBOR plus 175 basis points in 1998 and 150
basis points in 1999, and payable in semi-annual installments from September 30,
1998 through September 30, 2008. A revolving credit line of up to $200,000,000
bears interest at LIBOR plus 125 basis points in 1998 and 625 basis points in
1999, and is payable by March 19, 2005. Interest rates applicable to debt drawn
down at December 26, 1999, ranged from 67% to 77%. The debt is secured by
certain assets of the Company, and all of the debt is pre-payable without
penalty.
The terms of the Credit Agreement include certain operating and financial
restrictions, such as limits on the Company ability to incur additional debt,
create liens, sell assets, engage in mergers, make investments and pay
dividends.
33   The Company Credit Agreement requires a minimum of $300,000,000 of debt
be subject to interest rate protection agreements. This requirement has been
satisfied by three interest rate swap agreements, expiring in 2002 to 2003, with
an aggregate notional amount of $300,000,000. The effect of these agreements is
to fix the LIBOR interest rate exposure at approximately 59% on that portion of
the Company term loans.
The Company also entered into an interest rate collar with a $200,000,000
notional amount, and a LIBOR ceiling rate of 65% and a floor of 53%. The
collar arrangement terminates in the fourth quarter of 2000. The fair value of
these instruments as of December 26, 1999 is summarized in note 11. Payments
and receipts under such agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest
expense.
At December 26 1999, the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling
$31,622,000 securing estimated obligations stemming from workers' compensation
claims, pension liabilities and other contingent claims.

NOTE 7.  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Retirement Plans   The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans retirement plans which
cover a majority of its employees. Benefits are based on years of service and
compensation. Contributions to the plans are made by the Company in amounts
deemed necessary to provide benefits. Plan assets consist primarily of
investments in marketable securities including common stocks, bonds and U.S.
government obligations, and other interest bearing accounts. The Company
contributed $16 million in 1999 and $12 million in 1998 to multi-employer
plans.   The Company also has a number of supplemental retirement plans to provide
key employees with additional retirement benefits. The terms of the plans are
generally the same as those of the retirement plans, except that the
supplemental retirement plans are limited to key employees and benefits under
them are reduced by benefits received under the retirement plans. These plans
are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis and the accrued pension obligation is
included in other long-term obligations.

The Company also provides or subsidizes certain retiree health care and
life insurance benefits, under two plans - one for employees of McClatchy
Newspapers, Inc. and one for the Star Tribune Company employees. In 1997, the
Company terminated certain life insurance benefits for McClatchy Newspapers,
Inc. employees retiring on or after January 1, 1998, and accordingly, recorded a
curtailment gain of $417,000. The elements of post-retirement expenses are as

For the McClatchy Newspapers, Inc. post-retirement plan benefit obligation
of $ 45 million, income of $294,000, the medical care cost trend rates are
estimated to decline from 875% in 1999 to 58% by the year 2002. A 10% change
in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have decreased or increased the
APBO by $4,500 and the annual service cost nominally. For the Star Tribune
post-retirement plan, the medical cost trend rates are expected to decline from
88% in 1999 to 55% by the year 2004. For the Star Tribune plan benefit
obligation of $98 million and expense of $833,000, a 10% change in the
assumed health care cost trend rate would have increased the benefit obligation
and expense by $719,000 and $128,000 respectively, and decreased each by
$630,000 and $110,000, respectively.
The Company has deferred compensation plans 401k plans and other savings
plans which enable qualified employees to voluntarily defer compensation. The
Company mandatory matching contributions to the 401k plans were $6,232,000
in 1999, $6,010,000 in 1998 and $5,123,000 in 1997.

NOTE 10. COMMON STOCK AND STOCK PLANS
The Company Class A and Class B common stock participate equally in
dividends. Holders of Class B common stock are entitled to one vote per share
and to elect as a class 75% of the Board of Directors, rounded down to the
nearest whole number. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one-tenth
of a vote per share and to elect as a class 25% of the Board of Directors,
rounded up to the nearest whole number. Class B common stock is convertible at
the option of the holder into Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis.
At December 26, 1999 the Company has five stock-based compensation plans,
which are described below. The Company applies APB Opinion 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for its plans. No significant amounts of
compensation costs have been recognized for its fixed stock option plans and its
stock purchase plan.
The Company Amended Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan
reserved 1,875,000 shares of Class A common stock for issuance to employees.
Eligible employees may purchase shares at 85% of fair market value as
defined through payroll deductions. The Purchase Plan can be automatically
terminated by the Company at any time. As of December 26, 1999, 967,265 shares
of Class A common stock have been issued under the Purchase Plan.
42   The Company has three stock option plans which reserve 3,312,500 Class A
common shares for issuance to employees -- the 1987, 1994 and 1997 plans
Employee Plans. Terms of each of the Employee Plans are substantially the
same. Options are granted at the market price of the Class A common stock on
the date of grant. The options vest in installments over four years, and once
vested are exercisable up to 10 years from the date of grant. Although the
plans permit the Company, at its sole discretion, to settle unexercised options
by granting stock appreciation rights, the Company does not intend to avail
itself of this alternative except in limited circumstances.
The Company amended and restated stock option plan for outside directors
the Directors' Plan provides for the issuance of up to 187,500 shares of Class
A stock. Under the plan each outside director was granted an option at fair
market value at the conclusion of each regular annual meeting of stockholders
for 2,500 shares. Terms of the Directors' Plan are similar to the terms of the
Employee Plans. Outstanding options are summarized as follows                       Employee Plans         Directors' Plan

apply to all applicable stock options.
Compensation costs are calculated for the fair value of the employees'
purchase rights, which was estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the
following assumptions for 1999, 1998, and 1997 respectively: dividend yield of
10% to 14% for all years; an expected life of one to seven years for all
years; expected volatility of 2862, 2868 and 2838; and risk-free interest
rates of 54% to 63% in 1999, 45% to 58% in 1998 and 572 % to 662 % in
1997. The weighted-average fair value of those purchase rights granted in 1999,
1998, and 1997 was $1379, $958 and $899 , respectively for Employee Plans and
$1107, $933 and $828, respectively for the Directors' Plan. NOTE 11. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
