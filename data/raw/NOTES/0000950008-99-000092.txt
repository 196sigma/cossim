29              INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT The McClatchy Company     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The
McClatchy Company and its subsidiaries as of December 27, 1998, and December 31,
1997, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and
stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended December
27, 1998. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the Index to Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedules at Item 8.
These  financial  statements  and financial  statement  schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of The McClatchy Company and
its subsidiaries at December 27, 1998 and December 31, 1997, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 27, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.
As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, in 1998
the Company changed its method of accounting for newsprint inventory. Deloitte & Touche LLP

See notes to consolidated financial statements                    35 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The McClatchy Company the Company and its subsidiaries are engaged
primarily in the publication of newspapers located in Minnesota, California, the
Northwest Washington and Alaska and the Carolinas.
The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its
subsidiaries. Significant inter-company items and transactions are eliminated.
In preparing the financial  statements,  management  makes estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
FISCAL YEAR-END - In 1998, the Company changed from a calendar year to
a fiscal year ending on the Sunday nearest December 31. Accordingly, the
Company results are reported through December 27, 1998 versus December 31, in
prior years. This change did not materially affect 1998 net income.
REVENUE  RECOGNITION  -  Advertising  revenues are recorded when
advertisements are placed in the newspaper and circulation revenues are recorded
as newspapers are delivered over the subscription term. Unearned revenues
represent prepaid circulation subscriptions.
CASH EQUIVALENTS are highly liquid debt investments with maturities of
three months or less when acquired.
CONCENTRATIONS  OF CREDIT  RISKS - Financial  instruments  which
potentially  subject the Company to  concentrations of credit risks are
principally cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivables. Cash and
cash equivalents are placed with major financial institutions.  Accounts
receivable are with customers located primarily in the immediate area of each
city of publication. The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of
significant customers and this assessment, combined with the large number and
geographic diversity of its customers, limits the Company concentration of
risk with respect to trade accounts receivable.
INVENTORIES are stated at the lower of cost based principally on the
first-in, first-out method or current market value. See note 3 for a discussion
of a change in the method of accounting for newsprint inventory.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS - The Company owns a 135% interest in
Ponderay Newsprint Company Ponderay which owns and operates a newsprint mill
in the State of Washington. The investment is accounted for using the equity
method, under which the Company share of earnings of Ponderay is reflected in
income as earned. The Company guarantees certain bank debt used to 
36 construct the mill see note 9 and is required to purchase 28,400 metric tons
of annual production on a take-if-tendered basis until the debt is repaid. The
Company satisfies this obligation by direct purchase 1998: $16,732,000, 1997 18,221,000 and 1996: $20,714,000 or reallocation to other buyers.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT are stated at cost. Major renewals and
betterments, as well as interest incurred during construction, are capitalized.
No interest was capitalized in 1998. Capitalized interest aggregated $36,000 in
1997 and $536,000 in 1996.
DEPRECIATION is computed generally on a straight-line basis over
estimated useful lives of:
- 10 to 60 years for buildings
- 9 to 25 years for presses
- 3 to 15 years for other equipment
INTANGIBLES consist of the unamortized excess of the cost of acquiring
newspaper operations over the fair values of the newspapers' tangible assets at
the date of purchase. Identifiable intangible assets, consisting primarily of
lists of advertisers and subscribers, covenants not to compete and commercial
printing contracts, are amortized over three to forty years. The excess of
purchase prices over identifiable assets is amortized over forty years.
Management periodically evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets by
reviewing the current and projected cash flows of each of its newspaper
operations.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION - The Company accounts for stock-based awards
to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
DEFERRED INCOME TAXES result from temporary differences between amounts
of assets and liabilities reported for financial and income tax reporting
purposes. See note 5.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME - The Company has no changes in its net assets
during any period presented from non-owner sources. Hence, comprehensive income
is equal to net income.
SEGMENT REPORTING - The Company primary business is the publication
of newspapers. The Company aggregates its newspapers into a single segment
because each has similar economic characteristics, products, customers and
distribution methods.
EARNINGS PER SHARE EPS - Basic EPS excludes dilution and reflects
income divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for
the period. Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted average number of outstanding
shares of common stock and dilutive common stock equivalents stock options equivalents calculated using the treasury stock method, no adjustment to net
income required in the period. See note 10.
NOTE 2. MERGER WITH COWLES MEDIA COMPANY
On March 19, 1998 the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of
Cowles Media 
37 Company Cowles in a transaction valued at approximately $9050 per Cowles
share and the assumption of $77,350,000 in existing Cowles debt. Cowles
publishes the STAR TRIBUNE newspaper,  which serves the Twin Cities of
Minneapolis and St. Paul. Cowles also owned four separate subsidiaries that
publish business magazines, special-interest magazines and home improvement
books. Simultaneously with the close of the merger, the Company sold the
magazine and book publishing subsidiaries. The combined proceeds, plus debt and
other liabilities assumed by the buyers in those transactions, were $2081
million. These proceeds were used to repay debt associated with the Cowles
merger.
In connection with the Cowles merger, the Company paid 15% of the
consideration by issuing 6,330,548 shares of Class A Common Stock in exchange
for Cowles shares and paid cash for the remaining shares. The Class A shares
were exchanged using a ratio of 301667 shares of McClatchy Class A Common for
each Cowles share. The Company incurred bank debt through a syndicate of banks
and financial institutions to finance the cash requirements of the merger and to
refinance its existing debt see note 4. Results of the STAR TRIBUNE have been
included in the Company results beginning March 20, 1998.
The non-newspaper businesses were valued at fair market value based
upon the net after-tax proceeds received by the Company on March 19, 1998, and
accordingly, no gain or loss was realized on the sale.
The primary asset retained by the Company is the STAR TRIBUNE, the
largest newspaper in Minnesota with daily circulation of 387,000 and Sunday
circulation of 673,000 as of March 19, 1998. The STAR TRIBUNE is now the
Company largest newspaper.
The merger was accounted for as a purchase, and accordingly, assets
acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their fair market values.
Assets retained by the Company include approximately $55,319,000 of current
assets, $143,978,000 of property, plant and equipment, $1,166,400,000 of
intangible assets and $165,788,000 of other assets. Intangible assets include
approximately $929,000,000 of goodwill which is being amortized over 40 years.
In addition to assuming Cowles' long-term debt, a total of $214,197,000 of
deferred taxes and other liabilities were assumed. The Company is continuing to
assess the value of certain assets and liabilities, including identifiable
intangible assets, severance and other liabilities and will adjust its carrying
values as final determinations are made.
The following table summarizes, on an unaudited proforma basis, the
combined results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries for the years
ended December 27, 1998 and December 31, 1997, as though the Cowles merger had
taken place on January 1, 1997 in thousands, except per share amounts                      1998      1997

38     Cowles Media Company donated $10,000,000 to the Cowles Media Foundation
and incurred significant investment banking, legal and other costs associated
with the transaction in the first quarter of 1998, contributing to the dilution
in the pro forma results for the year ended December 27, 1998.
NOTE 3.  CHANGE IN METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR NEWSPRINT
INVENTORY
The Company has accounted for newsprint inventories by the first-in,
first-out FIFO method beginning January 1, 1998, whereas in all prior years
inventories were valued using the last-in, first-out LIFO method. The new
method of accounting for newsprint inventory was adopted to provide for a better
matching of revenues and expenses. Additionally, the change will enable the
financial reporting to parallel the way management assesses the financial and
operational performance of its newspapers. The financial statements of prior
years have been restated to apply the new method retroactively, and accordingly,
retained earnings as of December 31, 1995 have been increased by $4,340,000 to
reflect the restatement. The effect of the accounting change on net income as
previously reported for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, is as
follows in thousands                       1997      1996
Net income as previously reported    $  68,799   $  44,493
Adjustment for effect of change in
accounting for newsprint
inventories applied retroactively       433     2,387
Net income as adjusted          $  69,232   $  42,106
The adjustment resulted in an increase of $001 to basic and diluted
net income per share in 1997 and a reduction of $006 to basic and diluted net
income per share in 1996.
NOTE 4. LONG-TERM BANK DEBT AND OTHER LONG-TERM
OBLIGATIONS
On July 28, 1995 the Company entered into a bank credit agreement
providing for borrowings up to $310,000,000. At December 31, 1997, the Company
had long-term bank debt of $94,000,000 and the remaining balance of this debt
was refinanced with the new credit agreement obtained in connection with the
Cowles merger. See note 2 and the discussion below.
At December 31, 1997, the Company had an outstanding interest rate swap
that effectively converted $50,000,000 of debt under its Credit Agreement to a
fixed rate debt at a rate of 60%. The swap was terminated upon the closing of
the Cowles merger, with no significant loss to the Company.
39     The Company entered into a bank credit agreement Credit Agreement
with a syndicate of banks and financial institutions providing for borrowings of
up to $1,265,000,000 to finance the Cowles merger and refinance its existing
debt. The Credit Agreement includes term loans consisting of Tranche A of $735
million bearing interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus 125
basis points, payable in increasing quarterly installments from June 30, 1998
through March 31, 2005, and Tranche B of $330 million bearing interest at LIBOR
plus 175 basis points and payable in semi-annual installments from September 30,
1998 through September 30, 2008. A revolving credit line of up to $200 million
bears interest at LIBOR plus 125 basis points and is payable by March 19, 2005.
As the Company reduces the outstanding debt relative to cash flow as defined in
the Credit Agreement, the interest rate spread over LIBOR will decline.
Interest rates applicable to debt drawn down at December 27, 1998, ranged from
619% to 728%. The debt is secured by certain assets of the Company, and all of
the debt is pre-payable without penalty.
The terms of the Credit Agreement include certain operating and
financial restrictions, such as limits on the Company ability to incur
additional debt, create liens, sell assets, engage in mergers, make investments
and pay dividends.
The Company Credit Agreement requires a minimum of $300,000,000 of
debt be subject to interest rate protection agreements. During the second
quarter, the Company entered into interest rate protection agreements to reduce
the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt. The Company
is a party to three interest rate swap agreements, expiring in 2002 to 2003,
with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000,000. The effect of these
agreements is to fix the LIBOR interest rate exposure at 59% on that portion of
the Company term loans.
Also during the second quarter, the Company entered into an interest
rate collar with a $200,000,000 notional amount, and a LIBOR ceiling rate of
65% and a floor of 53%. The fair value of these instruments as of December 27,
1998, is summarized in note 11. Payments and receipts under such agreements are
recorded as adjustments to interest expense.
At December 27 1998, the Company had outstanding letters of credit
totaling $29,822,000 securing estimated obligations stemming from workers'
compensation claims, pension liabilities and other contingent claims.

NOTE 7. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
RETIREMENT PLANS     The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans retirement plans
which cover a majority of its employees. Benefits are based on years of service
and compensation. Contributions to the plans are made by the Company in amounts
deemed necessary to provide benefits.  Plan assets consist primarily of
investments in marketable securities including common stocks, bonds and U.S.
government obligations, and other interest bearing accounts. The Company
contributed $12 million to multi-employer retirement plans in 1998.
43     The Company also has a number of supplemental retirement plans to
provide key employees with additional retirement benefits. The terms of the
plans are generally the same as those of the retirement plans, except that the
supplemental retirement plans are limited to key employees and benefits under
them are reduced by benefits received under the retirement plans. These plans
are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis and the accrued pension obligation is
included in other long-term obligations.
The elements of pension costs are as follows in thousands                            December 27,      December 31,

benefits for employees retiring on or after January 1, 1998, and accordingly,
recorded a curtailment gain of $417,000. The elements of post-retirement

For the McClatchy Newspaper, Inc., post-retirement plan benefit
obligation of $49 million, income of $292,000, the medical care cost trend
rates are estimated to decline from 875% in 1998 to 58% by the year 2002. A
10% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have increased the
APBO and the annual service cost by 14 %. For the STAR TRIBUNE post-retirement
plan, the medical cost trend rates are expected to decline form 88% in 1998 to
55% by the year 2004. For the Star Tribune plan benefit obligation of $98
million and expense of $962,000, a 10% change in the assumed health care cost
trend rate would have increased the benefit obligation and expense by 92% and
125%, respectively, and decreased each by 81% and 108%, respectively.
The Company has deferred compensation plans 401k plans and other
savings plans which enable  qualified  employees to  voluntarily  defer
compensation. The Company mandatory matching contributions to the 401k plans
were $6,010,000 in 1998, $5,123,000 in 1997 and $4,704,000 in 1996.

NOTE 10. COMMON STOCK AND STOCK PLANS
On December 4, 1996, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a
five-for-four split on its Class A and Class B common stock in the form of a
special 25% stock dividend, which was paid on January 2, 1997 to the holders of
record of the common stock as of the close of business on December 16, 1996. All
share and per share amounts have been adjusted in the financial statements to
reflect the stock split.
The Company Class A and Class B common stock participate equally in
dividends. Holders of Class B common stock are entitled to one vote per share
and to elect as a class 75% of the Board of Directors, rounded down to the
nearest whole number. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one-tenth
of a vote per share and to elect as a class 25% of the Board of Directors,
rounded up to the nearest whole number. Class B common stock is convertible at
the option of the holder into Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis.
At December 27, 1998 the Company has five stock-based compensation
plans, which are described below. The Company applies APB Opinion 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for its plans. No significant  amounts of
compensation costs have been recognized for its fixed stock option plans and its
stock purchase plan.
The Company Amended Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan
reserved 1,875,000 shares of Class A common stock for issuance to employees.
Eligible employees may purchase shares at 85% of fair market value as
defined through payroll deductions. The Purchase Plan can be automatically
terminated by the Company at any time. As of December 27, 1998, 867,150 shares
of Class A common stock have been issued under the Purchase Plan.
The Company has three stock option plans which reserve 3,312,500 Class
A common shares for issuance to key employees -- the 1987, 1994 and 1997 plans
Employee Plans. Terms of each of the Employee Plans are substantially the
same. Options are granted at the market price of the Class A common stock on the
date of grant. The options vest in installments over four years, and
48 once vested are exercisable up to 10 years from the date of grant. Although the
plans permit the Company, at its sole discretion, to settle unexercised options
by granting stock appreciation rights, the Company does not intend to avail
itself of this alternative except in limited circumstances.
The Company amended and restated stock option plan for outside
directors the Directors' Plan provides for the issuance of up to 187,500
shares of Class A stock. Under the plan each outside director was granted an
option at fair market value at the conclusion of each regular annual meeting of
stockholders for 2,500 shares. Terms of the Directors' Plan are similar to the
terms of the Employee Plans. Outstanding options are summarized as follows                          Employee Plans          Directors' Plan

1997 and 1996 pro forma adjustments are not indicative of future period pro
forma adjustments, when the calculation will apply to all applicable stock
options.
Compensation costs are calculated for the fair value of the employees'
purchase rights, which was estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the
following assumptions for 1998, 1997, and 1996 respectively: dividend yield of
12% to 14% for all years; an expected life of one to seven years for all
years; expected volatility of 2868, 2838 and 2791; and risk-free interest
rates of 45% to 58% in 1998, 572 % to 662 % in 1997 and 54% to 64% in
1996. The weighted-average fair value of those purchase rights granted in 1998,
1997, and 1996 was $958, $899 and $831, respectively for Employee Plans and
$933, $828 and $561, respectively for the Directors' Plan.
