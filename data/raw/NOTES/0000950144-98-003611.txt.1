INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW
W. R. Grace & Co., through its subsidiaries, is one of the world
leading specialty chemicals companies. Grace entered the specialty chemicals
industry in 1954, when it acquired both the Dewey and Almy Chemical Company and
the Davison Chemical Company. Grace primarily operates through the following
three business units     GRACE DAVISON manufactures catalysts, including fluid cracking
catalysts that crack crude oil into transportation fuels and other
petroleum-based products, as well as polyolefin catalysts that are
critical in the manufacture of polyethylene resins for plastic film,
high-performance pipe and household containers. Grace Davison also
manufactures silica and zeolite adsorbents, which are used in a wide
variety of products, such as plastics, toothpastes, paints and
insulated glass, as well as in the refining of edible oils. Grace
Davison accounted for approximately 48% of Grace 1997 sales and
revenues from continuing operations.     GRACE CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS produces specialty construction chemicals,
including performance-enhancing concrete admixtures, cement additives
and masonry products; and specialty building materials, including
fireproofing and waterproofing materials and systems. Grace
Construction Products accounted for approximately 32% of Grace 1997
sales and revenues from continuing operations.     DAREX CONTAINER PRODUCTS produces container and closure sealants that
protect food and beverages from bacteria and other contaminants, extend
shelf life and preserve flavor; it also produces coatings used in the
manufacture of cans and closures. Darex Container Products accounted
for approximately 18% of Grace 1997 sales and revenues from
continuing operations.
Grace has classified certain other businesses as discontinued operations, the
most significant of which is its flexible packaging business Packaging
Business. Also see Products and Markets -- Other Businesses and Investments
below.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND ACTIONS. Grace strategy has been, and will
continue to be, to enhance stockholder value by profitably growing its specialty
chemicals businesses on a global basis and achieving high levels of financial
performance. To achieve these objectives, Grace plans to i invest in research
and development activities, with the goals of introducing new value-added
products and services and enhancing manufacturing processes; ii make selected
strategic acquisitions; and iii continue to implement process improvements and
cost-management initiatives, including rigorous controls on working capital and
capital spending. These plans are designed to make Grace a high-performance
company focused on the strengths of its global specialty chemicals businesses.
In furtherance of this strategy, Grace entered into a definitive
agreement with Sealed Air Corporation Sealed Air in August 1997 to combine
the Packaging Business with Sealed Air. This transaction was approved by the
Company shareholders on March 20, 1998 and by Sealed Air shareholders on March
23, 1998. As a result of these approvals, Grace has classified the Packaging
Business as a discontinued operation as of December 31, 1997. Grace will effect
the transaction with Sealed Air by transferring its specialty chemicals
businesses to a new Delaware corporation New Grace, spinning off New Grace
to Grace shareholders and merging a subsidiary of the Company with Sealed Air.
For further information, see the Company Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
dated February 13, 1998, New Grace Information Statement dated February 13,

PRODUCTS AND MARKETS
SPECIALTY CHEMICALS INDUSTRY OVERVIEW. Specialty chemicals, such as
those produced by Grace, are high-value-added products used as intermediates,
components or additives in a wide variety of products and processes; they are
produced in relatively small volumes and must satisfy well-defined performance
requirements and specifications. Specialty chemicals are often critical
components of the end products and processes in which they are used;
consequently, they are tailored to customer needs, which generally results in a
close relationship between the specialty chemicals producer and the customer.
Rapid response to changing customer needs and reliability of product and supply
are important competitive factors in specialty chemicals businesses.
Grace management believes that, in specialty chemicals businesses,
technological leadership resulting from continuous innovation through research
and development, combined with product differentiation and superior customer
service, lead to high operating margins. Grace believes that its businesses are
characterized by market features that reward the research and development and
customer service costs associated with its strategy.
GRACE DAVISON CATALYSTS AND SILICA-BASED PRODUCTS. Grace Davison,
founded in 1832, is composed of two primary product groups: i catalysts and
ii silica products and adsorbents. These products principally apply silica,
alumina and zeolite technology and are designed and manufactured to meet the
varying specifications of such diverse customers as major oil refiners, plastics
and chemical manufacturers, and consumer products companies. Grace Davison
believes that its technological expertise provides a competitive edge, allowing
it to quickly design products that meet changing customer specifications and to
develop new products that expand its existing technology. For example, Grace
Davison estimates that from 50% to 75% of its 1997 fluid cracking catalyst sales
was attributable to products introduced in the previous five years.
Grace Davison produces refinery catalysts, including i fluid cracking
catalysts used by petroleum refiners to convert crude oil into more valuable
transportation fuels such as gasoline and jet and diesel fuels and other
petroleum-based products, and ii hydroprocessing catalysts that remove certain
impurities such as nitrogen, sulfur and heavy metals from crude oil prior to
the use of fluid 
- 3   6 cracking catalysts. Grace Davison also develops and manufactures fluid cracking
catalyst additives used for octane enhancement and to reduce emissions of sulfur
oxides, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. Oil refining is a highly
specialized discipline, demanding that products be tailored to meet local
variations in crude oil and the refinery product output mix. Grace Davison
works regularly with most of the approximately 360 refineries in the world,
helping to find the most appropriate catalyst formulations for refiners'
changing needs. Grace Davison business has benefited in recent years, in part,
from refiners' use of heavier crude oils, and could be adversely affected by an
increase in the availability of lighter crude oil, which generally requires less
fluid cracking catalysts to refine. Grace Davison business is also affected by
the capacity utilization of refiners' cracking units, as disproportionately
greater amounts of fluid cracking catalysts are used at higher levels of
capacity utilization. Competition in the refinery catalyst business is based on
technology, product performance, customer service and price. Grace Davison
believes it is one of the world leaders in refinery catalysts and the largest
supplier of fluid cracking catalysts in the world.
Grace Davison is also a major producer of polyolefin catalysts and
catalyst supports, essential components in the manufacture of high density and
linear low density polyethylene resins used in products such as plastic film,
high-performance plastic pipe and plastic household containers. Grace Davison
catalysts and catalyst supports are used in manufacturing nearly half of all
such resins produced worldwide. The polyolefin catalyst business is
technology-intensive and focused on providing products formulated to meet
customer specifications. Manufacturers generally compete on a worldwide basis,
and competition has recently intensified due to evolving technologies,
particularly the use of metallocenes. Grace Davison believes that metallocenes
represent a revolutionary development in the making of plastics, allowing
manufacturers to design polymers with exact performance characteristics. Grace
Davison is continuing to work on the development and commercialization of
metallocene catalysts.
Silica products and zeolite adsorbents produced by Grace Davison are
used in a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications. For example,
silicas are used in coatings as flatting agents i.e., to reduce gloss, in
plastics to improve handling, in toothpastes as thickeners and cleaners, in
foods to carry flavors and prevent caking, and in the purification of edible
oils. Zeolite adsorbents are used between the two panes of insulated glass to
adsorb moisture and are used in process applications to separate certain
chemical components from mixtures. Competition is based on product performance,
customer service and price.
Grace Davison sales and revenues were $712 million in 1997, $732
million in 1996 and $700 million in 1995; 56% of Grace Davison 1997 sales and
revenues were generated in North America, 33% in Europe, 9% in Asia Pacific and
2% in Latin America. Sales of catalysts accounted for 28% of the total sales and
revenues of Grace continuing operations in 1997, 26% in 1996 and 23% in 1995.
Sales of silica products and zeolite adsorbents accounted for 14% of the total
sales and revenues of Grace continuing operations in 1997, 17% in 1996 and 14%
in 1995. At year-end 1997, Grace Davison employed approximately 2,700 people
worldwide in 10 facilities six in the U.S. and one each in Canada, Germany,
Brazil and Malaysia. Grace Davison principal U.S. manufacturing facilities
are located in Baltimore, Maryland and Lake Charles, Louisiana. Grace Davison
has a direct selling force and distributes its products directly to over 19,000
customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 7% of Grace
Davison 1997 sales and revenues.                    - 4   7
Most raw materials used in the manufacture of Grace Davison products
are available from multiple sources, and, in some instances, are produced by
Grace Davison. Because of the diverse applications of products using Grace
Davison technology and the geographic areas in which such products are used,
seasonality does not have a significant effect on Grace Davison businesses.
GRACE CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS SPECIALTY CONSTRUCTION CHEMICALS AND
BUILDING MATERIALS. Grace Construction Products is a leading supplier of
specialty chemicals and building materials to the nonresidential commercial and
government construction industry, and to a lesser extent, the residential
construction industry. Its products fall into two main groups: i specialty
construction chemicals principally concrete admixtures, cement additives and
masonry products that add strength, control corrosion, and enhance the handling
and application of concrete; and ii specialty building materials that prevent
water damage to structures such as water- and ice-barrier products for
residential use and waterproofing systems for commercial structures and protect
structural steel against collapse due to fire. In North America, Grace
Construction Products also manufactures and distributes vermiculite products
used in construction and other applications.
Grace Construction Products has introduced a number of new products and
product enhancements in recent years. These new products and enhancements
include an admixture that reduces concrete shrinkage and helps prevent cracking;
a product that enables contractors to pour and work concrete in colder
temperatures; an admixture that inhibits corrosion and prolongs the life of
concrete structures; an additive that improves cement processing efficiency and
product quality; new roof underlayments that provide protection from ice and
wind-driven rain; enhancements to fireproofing products that make Grace
Construction Products' fireproofing systems more price-competitive for smaller
jobs; and fireproofing products for industrial, petrochemical and acoustical
applications. In addition to customer acceptance of these and other product
introductions, Grace Construction Products' growth is dependent on the
advancement of less developed economies, with accompanying increases in
construction activity and sophistication of construction practices, which in
turn increase demand for Grace Construction Products offerings.
The materials produced by Grace Construction Products are marketed to
an extremely broad range of customers, including cement manufacturers, ready-mix
and pre-stressed concrete producers, local contractors, specialty subcontractors
and applicators, masonry block manufacturers, building materials distributors
and other industrial manufacturers, as well as construction specifiers, such as
architects and structural engineers. For some of these customer groups such as
contractors, cost and ease of application are the key factors in making
purchasing decisions; for others such as architects and structural engineers,
product performance and design versatility are the critical factors. In view of
this diversity, and because Grace Construction Products' business requires
intensive sales and customer service efforts, Grace Construction Products
maintains a separate sales and technical support team for each of its product
groups. These sales and support teams sell products under global contracts,
under U.S. or regional contracts and on a job-by-job basis. Consequently, Grace
Construction Products competes globally with several large construction
materials suppliers and regionally and locally with numerous smaller
competitors. In recent years, the cement manufacturing business and the
contracting business have experienced substantial consolidation, particularly in
markets outside the U.S. Competition is based largely on technical support and
service, product performance, adaptability of the product and price.                   - 5 -
8
Grace Construction Products' 1997 sales and revenues totaled $478
million 65% in North America, 17% in Asia Pacific, 16% in Europe and less than
2% in Latin America, versus $435 million in 1996 and $397 million in 1995.
Sales of specialty construction chemicals accounted for 19% of the total sales
and revenues of Grace continuing operations in 1997, 15% in 1996 and 12% in
1995; sales of specialty building materials accounted for 13% of the total sales
and revenues of Grace continuing operations in 1997, 11% in 1996 and 9% in
1995. At year-end 1997, Grace Construction Products employed approximately 2,000
people at 52 production facilities 22 in North America, 19 in Asia Pacific, 7
in Europe and 4 in Latin America and 75 sales offices worldwide. Grace
Construction Products' capital expenditures tend to be relatively lower, and
sales and marketing expenditures tend to be relatively higher, than those of
Grace other businesses.
The construction business is cyclical, in response to economic
conditions and construction demand. The construction market experienced slow but
steady growth through 1997 from a cyclical low in 1991. During this time, the
management of Grace Construction Products has focused its efforts on
streamlining its range of products by introducing new higher-value products,
eliminating lower-growth and lower-margin products and reducing costs. For
example, during this period, Grace Construction Products restructured its global
research activities and implemented a lower cost structure by consolidating
manufacturing operations and streamlining its management structure. The
construction business is also seasonal due to weather conditions. Grace
Construction Products seeks to increase profitability and minimize the impact of
cyclical and seasonal downturns in regional economies by introducing technically
advanced value-added products, expanding geographically, and developing business
opportunities in renovation construction markets. However, there can be no
assurance that Grace Construction Products' strategy to minimize the impact of
the cyclicality and seasonality of the construction business will succeed, and
such cyclicality and seasonality could adversely affect Grace Construction
Products' business and results of operations.
The raw materials used by Grace Construction Products can be obtained
from multiple sources, including commodity chemical producers, petroleum
companies and paper manufacturers. In most instances, there are at least two
alternative suppliers for each of the principal raw materials used by Grace
Construction Products. The worldwide supply of calcium lignin, a wood pulping
by-product used as a raw material in the production of concrete admixtures, had
been decreasing as paper mills converted to new manufacturing processes. In
1996, additional supplies of calcium lignin became available, alleviating the
shortage. However, there is no assurance that the additional supplies will
remain available in sufficient quantities or at satisfactory prices.
DAREX CONTAINER PRODUCTS CONTAINER SEALANTS AND COATINGS. Darex
Container Products consists primarily of three product lines: can sealants,
closure sealants and coatings for metal packaging. Can sealants ensure a
hermetic seal between the lid and the body of beverage, food, aerosol and other
cans. Closure sealants are used to seal pry-off and twist-off metal crowns, as
well as roll-on pilfer-proof and plastic closures, for glass and plastic bottles
and jars used in beverage and food applications. Coatings are used in the
manufacture of cans and closures to protect the metal against corrosion, to
protect the contents against the influences of metal, to ensure proper adhesion
of sealing compounds to metal surfaces, and to provide base coats for inks and
for decorative purposes. These products are principally sold to third parties
that manufacture containers or perform canning and bottling for food and
beverage companies.                    - 6   9
Darex Container Products is expanding its product offering and is
seeking to improve sales growth through new technologies, such as its
oxygen-scavenging compounds. These compounds are combined with closure sealants
to absorb oxygen in cans, jars and bottles, resulting in significantly extended
shelf life. Darex Container Products is commercially producing oxygen-scavenging
compounds for several breweries and is testing such compounds in other beverage
and food applications. Darex Container Products is also expanding in developing
regions. However, future sales growth will likely be impacted by the trend
toward can systems requiring fewer seams, as well as the increasing use of
plastic and glass containers. Competition is based on providing high-quality
customer service at customer sites, as well as on price, quality and
reliability. In addition, because of the relative concentration of the canning
and bottling market, maintaining relationships with leading container
manufacturers, canners and bottlers, and assisting them as they install new
production equipment and reengineer processes, are key elements for success.
Darex Container Products' sales and revenues were $264 million in 1997 275 million in 1996 and $280 million in 1995. Its products are marketed
internationally, with 35% of 1997 sales and revenues in Europe, 25% in North
America, 22% in Asia Pacific and 18% in Latin America. At year-end 1997, Darex
Container Products employed approximately 1,200 people at 22 production
facilities 7 in each of Latin America and Asia Pacific and 4 in each of North
America and Europe and 37 sales offices worldwide.
Although the raw materials used in Darex Container Products'
operations, including resins, rubber and latices, are generally available from
multiple sources, the prices of certain raw materials experienced upward
pressure during most of 1996 and, to a lesser extent, 1997. Darex Container
Products is seeking to establish global supply arrangements that would tend to
alleviate this pressure; however, no assurance can be given that such
arrangements can be entered into on acceptable terms. Although demand for
container packaging and sealant products tends to increase slightly during the
second and third quarters, the impact of such seasonality is not significant to
Darex Container Products.
Grace is considering strategic alternatives for Darex Container
Products. These alternatives include acquiring one or more complementary
businesses; entering into joint ventures or other combinations with such
businesses; or selling Darex Container Products. However, there is no assurance
as to whether or when any of these strategic alternatives will be accomplished.
OTHER BUSINESSES AND INVESTMENTS. Grace also owns businesses and
investments involved in health care services, the development of bioartificial
organs and other products and services. Grace is considering strategic
alternatives for these businesses and investments.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Grace most significant discontinued operation is the Packaging
Business, a leading global supplier of high-performance materials and systems
used in packaging food and industrial and consumer products. The Packaging
Business operates in the U.S. and in 45 other countries throughout the world.
The principal products of the Packaging Business are various food packaging
products and shrink and non-shrink films for industrial and consumer products.                   - 7 -
10
Approximately 80% of the 1997 net sales of the Packaging Business were
generated by food packaging products. These products include i shrink bags,
shrink films, laminated films and other specialty packaging systems including
material, equipment and services marketed under the CryovacR registered
trademark for a broad range of perishable foods such as fish, smoked and
processed meat products, cheese, poultry, prepared foods including soups and
sauces for restaurants and institutions, baked goods and produce; ii
polystyrene foam prepackaging trays for supermarkets and poultry and other food
processors, marketed under the FormpacTM trademark; and iii rigid plastic
containers for dairy and other food and nonfood products, marketed under the
OmicronTM trademark.
Approximately 20% of the 1997 net sales of the Packaging Business were
generated by shrink films and other films used in packaging a variety of
non-food industrial and consumer products, such as housewares, toys, electronics
and medical products.
The Packaging Business had net sales of $183 billion in 1997, $174
billion in 1996 and $169 billion in 1995. At year-end 1997, the Packaging
Business employed approximately 10,000 people. Grace expects to complete the
disposition of the Packaging Business in the 1998 first quarter. For further
information, see Strategic Objectives and Actions above, as well as Notes 1
and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management Discussion and
Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition in the Financial
Supplement.
RESEARCH ACTIVITIES
Grace engages in research and development programs directed toward the
development of new products and processes and the improvement of, and
development of new uses for, existing products and processes. Research is
carried out by product line laboratories in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific
and Latin America. Grace research and development strategy will be to develop
technology platforms on which new products will be based, while focusing
development efforts in each business unit on the improvement of existing
products and/or the adaptation of existing products to customer needs.
Research and development expenses relating to continuing operations
amounted to $42 million in 1997, $55 million in 1996 and $73 million in 1995
including expenses incurred in funding external research projects. The amount
of research and development expenses relating to government- and
customer-sponsored projects as opposed to projects sponsored by Grace was not
material.
See Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Condition in the Financial Supplement for additional information.
PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTERS
Grace products, processes and manufacturing equipment are protected
by numerous patents and patent applications, as well as know-how and other
proprietary information. As competition in the markets in which Grace does
business is often based on technological superiority and innovation, with new
products being introduced frequently, the ability to achieve technological
innovations and to obtain patent or other intellectual property protection is
important. There can be no assurance that Grace patents, patent applications
or other intellectual property will provide sufficient proprietary protection.                   - 8 -
11 In addition, other companies may independently develop similar systems or
processes that circumvent patents issued to Grace, or may acquire patent rights
within the fields of Grace businesses.
ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS
Manufacturers of specialty chemical products, including Grace, are
subject to stringent regulations under numerous U.S. federal, state and local
and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to
the generation, storage, handling, discharge and disposition of hazardous wastes
and other materials. Grace has expended substantial funds to comply with such
laws and regulations and expects to continue to do so in the future. The
following table sets forth Grace expenditures in the past three years, and its
estimated expenditures in 1998 and 1999, for i the operation and maintenance
of environmental facilities and the disposal of wastes with respect to
continuing operations; ii capital expenditures for environmental control
facilities relating to continuing operations; and iii site remediation           i            ii           iii

legislation or other developments. Grace earnings, competitive position and
other capital expenditures have not been, and are not expected to be, materially
adversely affected by compliance with environmental requirements. See Note 11 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management Discussion and Analysis
of Results of Operations and Financial Condition in the Financial Supplement.
With the goal of continuously improving Grace environmental, health
and safety EHS performance, Grace established its Commitment to CareTM
initiative based on the Responsible CareR program of the Chemical
Manufacturers Association in 1994 as the program under which all Grace EHS
activities are to be implemented. To the extent applicable, Commitment to Care
extends the basic elements of Responsible Care to all Grace locations worldwide,
embracing specific performance                    - 9   12
objectives in the key areas of product stewardship, employee health and safety,
community awareness and emergency response, distribution, process safety and
pollution prevention.
See Item 3 below for information concerning environmental proceedings
to which Grace is a party and Management Discussion and Analysis of Results
of Operations and Financial Condition in the Financial Supplement for
additional information concerning environmental matters.
ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES.
Grace operates manufacturing and other types of plants and facilities
including office and other service facilities throughout the world. Some of
these plants and facilities are shared by two or more of Grace business units,
and after the disposition of the Packaging Business, some plants and facilities
may also be shared with the combined business of Sealed Air and the Packaging
Business. Grace considers its major operating properties to be in good operating
condition and suitable for their current use. Although Grace believes that,
after taking planned expansion into account, the productive capacity of its
plants and other facilities is generally adequate for current operations and
foreseeable growth, it conducts ongoing, long-range forecasting of its capital
requirements to assure that additional capacity will be available when and as
needed. Accordingly, Grace does not anticipate that its operations or income
will be materially affected by the absence of available capacity. See Note 18 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management Discussion and Analysis
of Results of Operations and Financial Condition in the Financial Supplement
for information regarding Grace capital expenditures.

Item 6.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
ASBESTOS LITIGATION. Grace is a defendant in property damage and
personal injury lawsuits relating to previously sold asbestos-containing
products and expects that it will be named as a defendant in additional
asbestos-related lawsuits in the future. Grace was a defendant in approximately
40,600 asbestos-related lawsuits at December 31, 1997 18 involving claims for
property damage and the remainder involving approximately 96,900 claims for
personal injury, as compared to approximately 41,500 lawsuits at year-end 1996
31 involving claims for property damage and the remainder involving
approximately 91,500 claims for personal injury. In most of these lawsuits,
Grace is one of many defendants.
The plaintiffs in property damage lawsuits generally seek to have the
defendants absorb the cost of removing, containing or repairing the
asbestos-containing materials in the affected buildings. Through December 31,
1997, 139 asbestos property damage cases were dismissed without payment of any
damages or settlement amounts; judgments were entered in favor of Grace in nine
cases excluding cases settled following appeals of judgments in favor of
Grace; judgments were entered in favor of the plaintiffs in seven cases for a
total of $603 million none of which is on appeal; and 195 property damage
cases were settled for a total of $4766 million.                   - 10   13     Included in the asbestos property damage cases pending against Grace
and others at December 31, 1997 were the following class actions: i an action,
conditionally certified by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in
1993 and pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina,
covering all public and private colleges and universities in the U.S. whose
buildings contain asbestos materials CENTRAL WESLEYAN COLLEGE, ET AL. V. W. R.
GRACE, ET AL.; and ii a purported class action ANDERSON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL,
ET AL. V. W. R. GRACE & CO., ET AL., filed in 1992 in the Court of Common Pleas
for Hampton County, South Carolina, on behalf of all entities that own, in whole
or in part, any building containing asbestos materials manufactured by Grace or
one of the other named defendants, other than buildings subject to the class
action lawsuit described above and any building owned by the federal or any
state government. In July 1994, the claims of most class members in Anderson
Memorial Hospital, et al. v. W. R. Grace & Co., et al. were dismissed due to a
ruling that a South Carolina statute prohibits nonresidents from pursuing claims
in the South Carolina state courts with respect to buildings located outside the
state. The plaintiffs have requested that the court reconsider its decision.
Through December 31, 1997, approximately 12,700 personal injury
lawsuits involving 29,300 claims were dismissed without payment of any damages
or settlement amounts primarily on the basis that Grace products were not
involved, and approximately 38,900 such suits involving approximately 89,200
claims were disposed of for a total of $2556 million. See Insurance
Litigation below.
In 1991, the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation consolidated
in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, for
pre-trial purposes, all asbestos personal injury cases pending in the U.S.
federal courts, including approximately 7,000 cases then pending against Grace;
3,600 new cases involving 7,200 claims against Grace have subsequently been
added to the consolidated cases. To date, no action has been taken by the court
handling the consolidated cases that would indicate whether the consolidation
will affect Grace cost of disposing of these cases or its defense costs.
Grace previously purchased insurance policies with respect to its
asbestos-related lawsuits and claims. Grace has settled with and been paid by
its primary insurance carriers with respect to both property damage and personal
injury cases and claims. Grace also has settled with its excess insurance
carriers that wrote policies available for property damage cases; those
settlements involve amounts paid and to be paid to Grace. In addition, Grace has
settled with many excess insurance carriers that wrote policies available for
personal injury claims. Grace is currently in litigation with certain remaining
excess insurance carriers whose policies generally represent layers of coverage
Grace has not yet reached. Such policies are believed by Grace to be available
for asbestos-related personal injury lawsuits. Insurance coverage for
asbestos-related liabilities has not been commercially available since 1985.
Grace aggregate accrual for asbestos liabilities at December 31,
1997, was $8559 million; this amount reflects all asbestos-related property
damage and personal injury cases and claims then pending except for two
property damage cases as to which liability is not yet estimable because Grace
has not yet been able to obtain sufficient information through discovery
proceedings, as well as personal injury claims expected to be filed through
2002. Grace ultimate exposure with respect to its asbestos-related cases and
claims will depend on the number and nature of claims filed and the extent to
which insurance will cover damages for which it may be liable, amounts paid in
settlement and litigation costs. At December 31, 1997, Grace had recorded a
receivable of $2824 million, the amount Grace estimated to                   - 11   14 be the probable recovery from its insurance carriers with respect to pending and
projected asbestos cases and claims, as well as notes receivable from insurance
carriers of $313 million. A May 1994 decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit limited the amount of insurance coverage available to Grace
with respect to property damage cases. Because Grace insurance covers both
property damage and personal injury cases and claims, the May 1994 decision has
had the concomitant effect of reducing the insurance coverage available with
respect to Grace asbestos personal injury claims. However, in Grace opinion
which is not based on a formal opinion of counsel, it is probable that
recoveries from its insurance carriers, along with other funds, will be
available to satisfy the property damage and personal injury cases and claims
pending at December 31, 1997, as well as personal injury claims expected to be
filed in the foreseeable future. Consequently, Grace believes that the
resolution of its asbestos-related litigation will not have a material adverse
effect on its consolidated financial position.
See Insurance Litigation and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements and Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations
and Financial Condition in the Financial Supplement for additional information.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS. The following is a description of the
material environmental proceedings in which Grace is involved     Grace together with certain other companies has been designated a
potentially responsible party PRP by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency EPA with respect to absorbing the costs of investigating and
remediating pollution at various sites. At year-end 1997, proceedings were
pending with respect to approximately 30 sites as to which Grace has been
designated a PRP. U.S. federal law provides that all PRPs may be held jointly
and severally liable for the costs of investigating and remediating a site.
Grace is also conducting investigatory and remediation activities at sites under
the jurisdiction of state and/or local authorities.
In November 1995, Grace received a letter from the U.S. Department of
Energy DOE inquiring as to Grace willingness to contribute to the
continued cleanup of a former Grace property located in Wayne, New Jersey. The
letter asserted that Grace has a legal duty to pay for the cleanup and that the
total cost of cleanup may exceed $100 million. The operations conducted by Grace
at the Wayne site from 1955 to 1970 included work done on radioactive
materials under contract with the U.S. government. In 1975, the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission inspected the site, concluded that it was decontaminated
in accordance with applicable regulations and released it for unrestricted use.
In 1984, pursuant to a request from the DOE, Grace transferred the Wayne
property to the DOE and made a cash payment as a contribution towards the DOE
cleanup efforts at the site, which was acknowledged by the DOE as fulfilling any
obligation Grace had to contribute to the DOE cleanup effort while preserving
the rights and liabilities of the parties under other existing applicable laws.
Grace believes that the resolution of the DOE claim as well as related claims
by other U.S. governmental agencies will not have a material adverse effect on
its consolidated financial position.
Grace is a party to additional proceedings involving U.S. federal,
state and/or local government agencies and private parties regarding Grace
compliance with environmental laws and regulations. These proceedings are not
expected to result in significant sanctions or in any material liability.
However, Grace may incur material liability in connection with future actions of
governmental agencies                   - 12   15
or private parties relating to past or future practices of Grace with respect to
the generation, storage, handling, discharge or disposition of hazardous wastes
and other materials.
Grace believes that the liabilities for environmental remediation
costs, including costs relating to environmental proceedings, that have been
recorded in Grace historical financial statements are adequate. In addition,
Grace is presently involved in litigation with its insurance carriers, seeking
reimbursement from them for certain amounts for which Grace may be held liable
with respect to such costs. The outcome of such litigation, as well as the
amounts of any recoveries that Grace may receive in connection therewith, is
presently uncertain. However, Grace believes that the resolution of pending
environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position or liquidity of Grace. For further information,
see Environmental, Health and Safety Matters under Item 1 above and
Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
Condition in the Financial Supplement.
INSURANCE LITIGATION. Grace is involved in litigation with certain of
its insurance carriers with respect to asbestos-related insurance claims and
environmental liabilities. The relief sought by Grace in these actions would
provide insurance that would partially offset Grace estimated exposure with
respect to amounts previously expended, and that may be expended in the future,
by Grace to defend claims, satisfy judgments and fund settlements. Grace has
settled all of its asbestos-related insurance coverage actions, with the
exception of MARYLAND CASUALTY CO. V. W. R. GRACE & CO., pending in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which Grace is
asserting claims for insurance coverage for its asbestos-related personal injury
liabilities.
Pursuant to settlements with primary-level and excess-level insurance
carriers, Grace received payments totaling $3109 million prior to 1995, as well
as payments totaling $2573 million in 1995, $1845 million in 1996 and $687
million in 1997. Grace expects to receive additional amounts from insurance
carriers and has recorded receivables to reflect the expected amounts, as
discussed above under Asbestos Litigation. As a result of these settlements,
Grace asbestos-related insurance claims have been dismissed as to the
primary-level product liability insurance coverage previously sold by the
relevant insurers to Grace, as well as to many of Grace excess-level liability
insurers.
Grace only two environmental insurance coverage actions are pending
in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The first is
styled MARYLAND CASUALTY CO. V. W. R. GRACE & CO. Litigation continues in this
case as to certain primary-level and excess-level carriers that have not settled
with respect to claims for environmental property damage. The second case,
entitled UNIGUARD V. W. R. GRACE, was filed on December 17, 1997. This
declaratory judgment action seeks a determination concerning the liability of
one excess carrier for bodily injury claims as a result of environmental
contamination.
See Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Condition in the Financial Supplement for additional information.
FUMED SILICA PLANT LITIGATION. In 1993, Grace and certain of its
subsidiaries initiated legal action in the Belgian courts against the Flemish
government to recover losses resulting from the closing of one subsidiary
fumed silica plant in Puurs, Belgium. The action seeks damages in excess of four
billion Belgian francs approximately $1078 million at the December 31, 1997
exchange rate, plus interest and 
- 13   16
lost profits. This claim was dismissed at the trial court level and is now being
appealed. The trial court also determined that a subsidiary should repay
approximately 239 million Belgian francs approximately $64 million at the
December 31, 1997 exchange rate, plus interest, to the Flemish government for
previously received investment grants; this decision is also being appealed.
U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT LAWSUIT. The U.S. Justice Department has
intervened in a QUI TAM lawsuit, originally filed in June 1995, pending in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California UNITED STATES EX
REL. ROBERT COSTA AND RONALD THORNBURG, ET AL. V. BAKER & TAYLOR, INC., ET AL.
The complaint in this lawsuit alleges that Baker & Taylor Books, a book
wholesaler sold by Grace in 1992, overcharged public schools, libraries and
federal agencies during the last ten years, including the period during which
Baker & Taylor Books was owned by Grace. Grace and Baker & Taylor, Inc. the
entity that currently operates Baker & Taylor Books have been named as
defendants. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, punitive damages and civil
penalties, as well as attorneys' fees and expenses and such other relief as the
Court may deem proper. At this time, Grace is unable to determine the liability,
if any, to which it may be subject as a result of this lawsuit.
STOCKHOLDER LITIGATION. W. R. Grace & Co., a New York corporation
subsequently renamed Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. Grace New York,
and former members of the Grace New York Board of Directors as well as J. P.
Bolduc, who resigned as president and chief executive officer and a director of
Grace New York in March 1995 were named as defendants in a case entitled
WEISER, ET AL. V. GRACE, ET AL. pending in New York State Supreme Court, New
York County. The consolidated amended complaint in this lawsuit, which purports
to be a derivative action i.e., an action brought on behalf of Grace New York,
alleges, among other things, that the individual defendants breached their
fiduciary duties to Grace New York i by providing J. Peter Grace, Jr. the
chairman and a director of Grace New York until his death in April 1995 with
certain compensation arrangements upon his voluntary retirement as Grace New
York chief executive officer in 1992 and ii by approving Mr. Bolduc
severance arrangements, and that Messrs. Grace and Bolduc breached their
fiduciary duties by accepting such benefits and payments. The lawsuit seeks
unspecified damages, the cancellation of all allegedly improper agreements, the
cancellation of a retirement plan for nonemployee directors which was
terminated by Grace in 1997, the return of all remuneration paid to the
directors who are defendants while they were in breach of their fiduciary duties
to Grace New York, attorneys' and experts' fees and costs, and such other relief
as the Court deems proper. A motion to intervene in the case by the California
Public Employees' Retirement System was granted by the Court in September 1996.
Grace appointed a special committee of independent directors to investigate the
allegations made in the WEISER action. In March 1998, the special committee
filed a motion to dismiss the WEISER action on the grounds that it is without
merit and that the prosecution of the action is not in the best interests of the
Company and its shareholders.
Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement NMC Distribution
Agreement entered into in connection with the reorganization of Grace New York
in September 1996 the NMC Transaction described in Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in the Financial Supplement, Grace remains
financially responsible for any liabilities incurred by Grace New York and
others as a result of this lawsuit, including the fees and disbursements of
counsel for Grace and, subject to certain conditions, counsel for the individual
defendants including certain current and former directors of Grace. The
discussions of the NMC Distribution Agreement appearing above and in the
following paragraphs do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the NMC Distribution                   - 14   17
Agreement, which was filed as an exhibit to the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus
of Grace New York dated August 2, 1996.
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION INVESTIGATION. In April 1996, Grace
New York received a formal order of investigation issued by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission SEC directing an investigation into, among other
things, whether Grace New York violated the U.S. federal securities laws by
filing periodic reports with the SEC that contained false and misleading
financial information. Pursuant to this formal order of investigation, Grace and
Grace New York have provided information to the SEC relating to reserves net of
applicable taxes established by Grace New York and its subsidiary, National
Medical Care, Inc. NMC, during the period from January 1, 1990 to 1996
Covered Period. In connection with the preparation of the NMC Form 10 filed
with the SEC in September 1995, Grace reversed previously unallocated reserves
established at NMC in 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993 that are a subject of this
investigation. Also in connection with the preparation of such Form 10, Grace
established reserves in an approximately equal amount with respect to
investments in Cross Country Healthcare Personnel, Inc. and in NMC German
renal products manufacturing facilities.
Under the terms of the NMC Distribution Agreement, Grace remains
financially responsible for any liabilities incurred by Grace New York and
others as a result of the investigation described above, including the fees and
disbursements of counsel for Grace and, subject to certain conditions, counsel
for certain former directors and officers of Grace.
CLAIMS RELATING TO NMC. Grace New York and certain of its officers and
directors were named as defendants in a lawsuit entitled MURPHY, ET AL. V. W. R.
GRACE & CO., ET AL., which is pending in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York. The first amended class action complaint in this
lawsuit, which purports to be a class action on behalf of all persons and
entities who purchased Grace New York publicly traded securities during the
period from March 13, 1995 through October 17, 1995 the Class Period,
generally alleges that the defendants concealed information, and issued
misleading public statements and reports, concerning NMC financial position
and business prospects, a proposed spin-off of NMC and the matters that are the
subject of investigations of NMC by the Office of the Inspector General of the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services the OIG, in violation of U.S.
federal securities laws. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, attorneys' and
experts' fees and costs and such other relief as the Court deems proper.
Grace New York and certain of its former officers and directors were
also named as defendants in a purported derivative action in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York BENNETT V. BOLDUC, ET AL.,
alleging that such individuals breached their fiduciary duties by failing to
properly supervise the activities of NMC in the conduct of its business. The
BENNETT action seeks unspecified damages, attorneys' and experts' fees and costs
and such other relief as the Court deems proper. A third derivative action
relating to NMC, entitled BAUER V. BOLDUC, ET AL., was filed in October 1995 in
the Supreme Court of the State of New York for the County of New York. The Bauer
action has been stayed in favor of the BENNETT action.
Grace and other defendants in the MURPHY, BENNETT AND BAUER actions
have agreed with the plaintiffs to settle those actions. The agreement provides
for the establishment of a fund of approximately $32 million less plaintiffs'
attorneys' fees to compensate a class of stockholders consisting of purchasers
of Grace New York stock during the Class Period. As part of the settlements, the
insurance carrier for the directors and officers will cause $10 million to be
paid to Grace on behalf of                   - 15   18
the individual defendants named in the MURPHY, BENNETT and BAUER actions. The
settlements are contingent upon court approval. The net payment to be made by
Grace in connection with these settlements will be charged against previously
established reserves.
Under the terms of the NMC Distribution Agreement, Grace remains
financially responsible for any liabilities incurred by Grace New York and
others as a result of the lawsuits described above, including the fees and
disbursements of counsel for Grace and, subject to certain conditions, counsel
for the individual defendants including certain former directors and officers
of Grace. The NMC Distribution Agreement also provides generally for certain
cross-indemnities designed to place with Grace New York which has become a
subsidiary of Fresenius AG, a German corporation not affiliated with Grace
financial responsibility for the liabilities of the health care businesses
formerly owned by Grace New York including, without limitation, all liabilities
relating to compliance or noncompliance with U.S. food and drug law, medical and
Medicare billing and reimbursement law and other health care matters and to
place with Grace financial responsibility for the other liabilities of Grace New
York and its other subsidiaries including, without limitation, liabilities
relating to the manufacture or sale of asbestos- containing materials by the
specialty chemicals businesses. Grace and Grace New York have asserted claims
against each other for indemnity with respect to claims asserted by third
parties pursuant to the terms of these provisions.

STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.
Except as provided below, the information called for by this Item
appears in the Financial Supplement under the heading Financial Summary
opposite the caption Other Statistics - Common shareholders of record page
F-29; under the heading Quarterly Summary and Statistical Information -
Unaudited opposite the captions Dividends declared per common share and
Market price of common stock page F-28; and in Note 12 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements page F-22.
Each share of the Company Common Stock, par value $01 per share
Common Stock, has an attendant Preferred Stock Purchase Right Right. The
Rights are not and will not become exercisable unless and until certain events
occur as described below. Until such events occur, the Rights will
automatically trade with the Common Stock, and separate certificates for the
Rights will not be distributed. The Rights will become exercisable on the
earlier to occur of a 10 days after a person or group Acquiring Person has
acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the then outstanding shares of
Common Stock or b 10 business days or such later date as may be fixed by the
Company                   - 16   19
Board of Directors after an Acquiring Person commences or announces the
intention to commence a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in
such Acquiring Person becoming the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the then
outstanding shares of Common Stock. Holders of Rights, as such, have no rights
as stockholders of the Company; consequently, such holders have no rights to
vote or receive dividends, among other things.
When the Rights become exercisable, each Right will initially entitle
the holder to buy from the Company one hundredth of a share of the Company
Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $01 per share Junior
Preferred Stock, for $200, subject to adjustment exercise price. If, at
any time after the Rights become exercisable, the Company is acquired in a
merger or other business combination or 50% or more of the Company
consolidated assets or earning power is sold, each Right not owned by an
Acquiring Person will entitle the holder to buy a number of shares of common
stock of the acquiring company having a market value equal to twice the exercise
price. Alternatively, each Right not owned by an Acquiring Person would become
exercisable for Common Stock having a market value equal to twice the exercise
price.
Shares of Junior Preferred Stock that may be purchased upon exercise of
the Rights will not be redeemable. Each share of Junior Preferred Stock will be
entitled to a minimum preferential quarterly dividend payment of $100 per share
but will be entitled to an aggregate dividend equal to 100 times the dividend
declared per share of Common Stock whenever such dividend is declared. In the
event of liquidation, holders of Junior Preferred Stock will be entitled to a
minimum preferential liquidation payment of $100 per share but will be entitled
to an aggregate payment equal to 100 times the payment made per share of Common
Stock. Each share of Junior Preferred Stock will have 100 votes, voting together
with the Common Stock. Finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or
other transaction in which the Common Stock is exchanged, each share of Junior
Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive an amount equal to 100 times the
amount received per share of Common Stock. These rights are protected by
customary antidilution provisions.
Because of the nature of the dividend, liquidation and voting rights of
the Junior Preferred Stock, the value of the one-hundredth interest in a share
of Junior Preferred Stock that may be purchased upon exercise of each Right
should approximate the value of one share of Common Stock.
At any time after any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, and
prior to the acquisition by such Acquiring Person of 50% or more of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Company Board of Directors may
exchange the Rights other than Rights owned by such person or group, which will
become void after such person becomes an Acquiring Person for Common Stock or
Junior Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one share
of Common Stock, or one hundredth of a share of Junior Preferred Stock or of a
share of another series of the Company Preferred Stock having equivalent
rights, preferences and privileges, per Right subject to adjustment.
At any time prior to the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial
ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the
Company Board of Directors may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at
a price of $01 per Right.
The terms of the Rights may be amended by the Company Board of
Directors without the consent of the holders of the Rights, including an
amendment to lower a the threshold at which a person becomes an Acquiring
Person and b the percentage of Common Stock proposed to be acquired                   - 17   20
in a tender or exchange offer that would cause the Rights to become exercisable,
to not less than the greater of a the sum of 001% plus the largest percentage
of the Company outstanding Common Stock then known to the Company to be
beneficially owned by any person or group and b 10%, except that, from and
after such time as any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, no such
amendment may adversely affect the interests of the holders of the Rights.
The Rights are currently scheduled to expire in September 2006 subject
to extension or the earlier redemption or exchange of the Rights. The Rights
will not become exercisable as a result of, and will be terminated in connection
with, the disposition of the Packaging Business described under Introduction
and Overview -- Strategic Objectives and Actions in Item 1 above, although New
Grace will have substantially identical rights.
The foregoing summary of the Rights does not purport to be complete and
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Rights Agreement, which was
filed as an exhibit to the Company Form 8-K filed on October 10, 1996.
