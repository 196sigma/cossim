These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Pixelworks, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2014, in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, Pixelworks, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated March 4, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting./s/ KPMG LLPPortland, OregonMarch4, 201544PIXELWORKS, INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETSIn thousands, except share dataDecember 31,20142013ASSETSCurrent assets:Cash and cash  receivable,  expenses and other current assets8882,858Total current assets26,36030,087Property and equipment, net6,4024,084Other assets, net1,3822,573Total  AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITYCurrent liabilities:Accounts payable$3,154$1,327Accrued liabilities and current portion of long-term liabilities8,53910,505Current portion of income taxes payable19792Short-term line of credit3,0003,000Total current  liabilities, net of current portion1,476677Income taxes payable, net of current portion2,0942,201Total  and contingencies Note 7Shareholders' equity:Preferred stock, $0001 par value, 50,000,000 shares authorized, none issuedCommon stock, $0001 par value;

Pixelworks was founded in 1997 and is incorporated under the laws of the state of Oregon.Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pixelworks and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. All foreign subsidiaries use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency, and as a result, transaction gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations. Transaction losses were $159, $123and $84for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Our significant estimates and judgments include those related to revenue recognition, product returns, warranty obligations, bad debts, inventories, property and equipment, impairment of long-lived assets, valuation of share-based payments, income taxes, litigation and other contingencies. The actual results experienced could differ materially from our estimates. NOTE2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESCash and Cash EquivalentsWe classify all cash and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase as cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents, which consist of U.S. denominated money market funds totaled $17,480and $20,396as of December31, 2014and 2013, respectively.Accounts ReceivableAccounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amount and do not bear interest when recorded or accrue interest when past due. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. At the end of each reporting period, we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on an account-by-account risk analysis of outstanding receivable balances. The determination to write-off specific accounts receivable balances is made based on the likelihood of collection and past due status. Past due status is based on invoice date and terms specific to each  consist of finished goods and work-in-process, and are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis or market net realizable value50Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets which are generally as follows:SoftwareLesser of 3 years or contractual license termEquipment, furniture and fixtures2 yearsTooling2 to 4 yearsLeasehold improvementsLesser of lease term or estimated useful lifeThe cost of property and equipment repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred.Licensed TechnologyWe have capitalized licensed technology assets in other long-term assets. These assets are stated at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the license or the estimated life of the asset, if the license is not contractually limited, which is generally twoto fiveyears.Useful Lives and Recoverability of Equipment and Other Long-Lived AssetsWe evaluate the remaining useful life and recoverability of equipment and other assets, including identifiable intangible assets with definite lives, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If there is an indicator of impairment, we prepare an estimate of future, undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of each asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value.Revenue RecognitionWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For product sales, we require customers to provide purchase orders prior to shipment and we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer based on the shipping terms. These conditions are generally satisfied upon shipment of the underlying product.There are no customer acceptance provisions associated with our products, and except for replacement of defective products under our warranty program discussed below, we have no obligation to accept product returns from end customers; however, we have accepted returns on a case-by-case basis as customer accommodations in the past. As a result, we provide for estimated reductions to gross profit for these sales returns in our reserve for sales returns and allowances. At the end of each reporting period, we estimate the reserve based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions. The reserve is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.A portion of our sales are made to distributors under agreements that grant the distributor limited stock rotation rights and price protection on in-stock inventory. The stock rotation rights allow these distributors to exchange a limited amount of their in-stock inventory for other Pixelworks product. As a result, we provide for estimated reductions to gross profit for these stock rotations in our reserve for sales returns and allowances. At the end of each reporting period, we estimate the reserve based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions. The reserve is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.Under price protection provisions, we grant distributors credit if they purchased product for a specific end customer and we subsequently lower the price to the end customer such that the distributor can no longer earn its negotiated margin on in-stock inventory. At the end of each reporting period, we estimate a reserve for price protection credits based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions. 51On occasion, we derive revenue from the license of our internally developed intellectual property IP. IP licensing agreements that we enter into generally provide licensees the right to incorporate our IP components in their products with terms and conditions that vary by licensee. Our license fee arrangements generally include multiple deliverables and we are required to determine whether there is more than one unit of accounting. To the extent that the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting, we allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual units of accounting using managements best estimate of selling price ESP, if third party evidence TPE or vendor specific objective evidence VSOE does not exist. We defer revenue recognition for consideration that is contingent upon future performance or other contractual terms.The Company process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. The key factors considered by the Company in developing the ESPs include the nature and complexity of the licensed technologies, our cost to provide the deliverables, the availability of substitute technologies in the marketplace and the Company historical pricing practices. We then recognize revenue for each unit of accounting depending on the nature of the deliverables comprising the unit of accounting in accordance with the revenue recognition criteria mentioned above.Fees under these agreements generally include alicense fees relating to our IP, b engineering services, and csupport services. Historically, each of these elements have standalone value and therefore each are treated as separate units of accounting. Any future licensing arrangements will be analyzed based on the specific facts and circumstances which may be different than our historical licensing arrangements.For deliverables related to licenses of our technology that involve significant engineering services, we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of the proportional performance method. We determine costs associated with engineering services using actual labor dollars incurred and estimated other direct or incremental costs allocated based on the percentage of time the engineers spent on the project. These costs are deferred until revenue recognition criteria have been met, at which time they are reclassified as cost of revenue.Warranty ProgramWe warrant that our products will be free from defects in material and workmanship for a period of twelve months from delivery. Warranty repairs are guaranteed for the remainder of the original warranty period. Our warranty is limited to repairing or replacing products, or refunding the purchase price. At the end of each reporting period, we estimate a reserve for warranty returns based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions. The reserve for warranty returns is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.Stock-Based CompensationWe currently sponsor a stock incentive plan that allows for issuance of employee stock options and restricted stock awards, including restricted stock units. We also have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. The fair value of share-based payment awards is expensed straight-line over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, for the entire award. Additionally, any modification of an award that increases its fair value will require us to recognize additional expense.The fair value of our stock option grants and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan are estimated as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model which is affected by our estimates of the risk free interest rate, our expected dividend yield, expected term and the expected share price volatility of our common shares over the expected term. The fair values of our restricted stock awards are based on the market value of our stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the effect of estimated forfeitures52Research and DevelopmentCosts associated with research and development activities are expensed as incurred, except for items with alternate future uses which are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life.On occasion, we enter into co-development arrangements with current or prospective integrated circuit IC customers to defray a portion of the research and development expenses we expect to incur in connection with our development of an IC product. As amounts become due and payable without recourse under co-development agreements, they are offset against research and development expense up to the amount of related costs incurred.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the asset will not be realized in future tax returns.An uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return, that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. Until these positions are sustained by the taxing authorities, we do not recognize the tax benefits resulting from such positions and report the tax effects for uncertain tax positions in our consolidated balance sheets.Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income LossAccumulated other comprehensive income loss, net of tax, consists of the  income loss on pension obligation$38$52Accumulated transition pension obligation2730Accumulated other comprehensive income loss$11$82Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsSee Note 4 for information regarding accounting policies related to the fair value of our financial instruments.Risks and UncertaintiesConcentration of SuppliersWe do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility and do not have the resources to manufacture our products internally. We rely on a limited number of foundries and assembly and test vendors to produce all of our wafers and for completion of finished products. We do not have any long-term agreements with any of these suppliers. In light of these dependencies, it is reasonably possible that failure to perform by one of these suppliers could have a severe impact on our results of operations. Additionally, the concentration of these vendors within Taiwan, the Peoples Republic of China and Singapore increases our risk of supply disruption due to natural disasters, economic instability, political unrest or other regional disturbances. 53Risk of Technological ChangeThe markets in which we compete, or seek to compete, are subject to rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changing customer requirements for new products and features, and evolving industry standards. The introduction of new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our products less desirable or obsolete, which could harm our business.Concentrations of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash equivalents and accounts receivable. We limit our exposure to credit risk associated with cash equivalent balances by holding our funds in high quality, highly liquid money market accounts. We limit our exposure to credit risk associated with accounts receivable by carefully evaluating creditworthiness before offering terms to customers.Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with CustomersASU 2014-09, which requires that an entity recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. ASU 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption and will become effective for the Company on January 1, 2017. The Company is evaluating the alternative transition methods and the potential effects of the adoption of this update on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.In July2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward ExistsASU 2013-11, which required an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, unless an exception applies.The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December15, 2013. The Company adopted ASU 2013-11 in the first quarter of 2014. The adoption of ASU 2013-11 did not have a material impact on the Company financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a result of this change.

On December 14, 2012, we and the Bank entered into Amendment No. 1 the Amendment No. 1 to the Revolving Loan Agreement. The Revolving Loan Agreement, as amended, provides a secured working capital-based revolving line of credit the Revolving Line in an aggregate amount of up to the lesser ofi $10,000, or ii$1,000plus 80%of eligible domestic accounts receivable and certain foreign accounts receivable. On December 4, 2013, we and the Bank entered into Amendment No. 2 the Amendment No. 2 to the Revolving Loan Agreement which changes the maturity date of the revolving line of credit provided pursuant to the Revolving Loan Agreement to January 1, 2016. The maturity date was previously December 14, 2014, as provided by Amendment No. 1 to the Revolving Loan Agreement. In addition, the Revolving Loan Agreement, as amended, provides for non-formula advances of up to $10,000which may be made solely during the last fivebusiness days of any fiscal month or quarter and which must be repaid by the Company on or before the fifth business day after the applicable fiscal month or quarter end.Amounts advanced under the Revolving Line bear interest at an annual rate equal to the lender prime rate plus 025%. The Revolving Loan Agreement, as amended also provides an option for LIBOR advances that bear interest based on the LIBOR rate. Interest on the Revolving Line is due monthly, with the balance due on January 1, 2016, which is the scheduled maturity date for the Revolving Line.The Revolving Loan Agreement, as amended contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including with respect to the following: compliance with laws, provision of financial statements and periodic reports, payment of taxes, maintenance of inventory and insurance, maintenance of operating accounts at the Bank, the Bank access to collateral, formation or acquisition of subsidiaries, incurrence of indebtedness, dispositions of assets, granting liens, changes in business, ownership or business locations, engaging in mergers and acquisitions, making investments or distributions and affiliate transactions. The covenants also require that the Company maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying financial assets to the sum of qualifying financial obligations.The Revolving Loan Agreement, as amended also contains customary events of default, including the following: defaults with respect to covenant compliance, the occurrence of a material adverse change, the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, cross-defaults, judgment defaults and material misrepresentations. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the Company obligations under the Revolving Loan Agreement, as amended and an increase to the applicable interest rate, and would permit the Bank to exercise remedies with respect to its security interest.To secure the repayment of any amounts borrowed under the Revolving Loan Agreement, as amended, the Company granted to the Bank a security interest in substantially all of its assets, excluding its intellectual property assets. The Company has agreed not to pledge or otherwise encumber its intellectual property assets without prior written permission from the Bank.Short-term borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Line consisted of non-formula advances of $3,000as of December 31, 2014 and as of December 31, 2013, both advances were repaid within required terms. The weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was 35%. 56NOTE 4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:Level 1:Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.Level 2:Valuations based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.Level 3:Valuations based on unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.The following table presents information about our assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets as of December31, 2014 and 2013:Level 1Level 2Level3TotalAs of December31, 2014:Money market funds$17,480 17,480As of December31, 2013:Money market funds$20,396 20,396We primarily use the market approach to determine the fair value of our financial assets. The fair value of our current assets and liabilities, including accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates the carrying value due to the short-term nature of these balances. We have currently chosen not to elect the fair value option for any items that are not already required to be measured at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP.NOTE 5.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTDuring 2012, we entered into a best efforts co-development agreement the Co-development Agreement with a customer to defray a portion of the research and development expenses that would be incurred in connection with our development of an IC product to be sold exclusively to the customer. Under the Co-development Agreement, we retained ownership of any modifications or improvements that were made to our pre-existing intellectual property and may use such improvements in products sold to other customers.At the completion of certain development milestones under the Co-development Agreement, we invoiced the customer and recognized offsets to research and development expense of $3,500in each of 2012 and 2013. All milestones under the Co-development Agreement were completed as of December 31, 201357NOTE 6.INCOME TAXESCurrent and Deferred Income Tax Expense BenefitDomestic and foreign pre-tax income loss is as follows:Year Ended  and foreign pre-tax  tax expense benefit attributable to continuing operations is comprised of the following:Year Ended   deferred89154110Income tax expense benefit$518$328$571The reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate is as follows:Year Ended  statutory rate34%34%34%Change in valuation allowance39813Expiration of tax attributes4389State income taxes, net of federal tax benefit322Stock-based compensation2614Tax contingencies, net of reversals156Impact of foreign  income tax rate5%4%9%58Deferred Tax Assets, Liabilities and Valuation AllowanceDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as  tax assets:Net operating loss  and experimentation credit  tax credit  stock-based compensation2,7942,520Capital loss  and  and accrued  gross deferred tax assets93,63390,517Deferred tax liabilities:Foreign  gross deferred tax liabilities685956Less valuation allowance92,79289,136Net deferred tax assets$156$425The current portion of the net deferred tax asset balance was $133and $234as of December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The non-current portion of the net deferred tax asset balance was $27and $191as of December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and is included in other assets, net in the consolidated balance sheets. Long-term deferred tax liabilities were $4and $0as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and are included in long-term liabilities, net of current portion in the consolidated balance sheets.We continue to record a full valuation allowance against our U.S. net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 as it is not more likely than not that we will realize a benefit from these assets in a future period. We have not provided a valuation allowance against any of our foreign net deferred tax assets as we have concluded it is more likely than not that we will realize a benefit from these assets in a future period because our subsidiaries in these jurisdictions are cost-plus taxpayers. The net valuation allowance increased $3,656, decreased $705and increased $832for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.As of December31, 2014, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $203,422and $17,745respectively, which will expire between 2015 and 2034. As of December31, 2014, we had available federal and state research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards of $7,983and $3,203, respectively, which begin expiring in 2019. We have a general foreign tax credit of $3,185which will begin expiring in 2016. Our ability to utilize our federal net operating losses may be limited by Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which imposes an annual limit on the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its net operating loss carryforwards to reduce its tax liability. An ownership change is generally defined as a greater than 50%point increase in equity ownership by 5%shareholders in any three-year period.We had undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of $2,324as of December31, 2014, for which we have recorded a deferred tax liability. Our Chinese subsidiary is designated as an Advanced Technology Service Enterprise, allowing it to benefit from a Chinese tax holiday resulting in a reduction of its tax rate to 15%through 2018. 59On December 19, 2014, the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 was enacted, which retroactively extended the research credit from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014. The estimated research credit for 2014 has been included in the calculation of our annual effective tax rate.The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which reinstated the United States federal research and development tax credit retroactively from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013, was not enacted into law until the first quarter of 2013. Therefore, the deferred tax asset resulting from such reinstatement for 2012 was reflected in 2013.Uncertain Tax PositionsWe have recorded tax reserves to address potential exposures involving positions that could be challenged by taxing authorities. As of December31, 2014 the amount of our uncertain tax positions was a liability of $1,712and a reduction to deferred tax assets of $160. As of December 31, 2013, the amount of our uncertain tax positions was a liability of $1,897.The following is a summary of the change in our liability for uncertain tax positions and interest and penalties:20142013Uncertain tax positions:Balance at beginning of year$1,592$1,653Accrual for positions taken in a prior year2110Accrual for positions taken in current year249222Reversals due to lapse of statute of limitations174293Balance at end of year$1,646$1,592Interest and penalties:Balance at beginning of year$305$437Accrual for positions taken in prior year1727Reversals due to lapse of statute of limitations96159Balance at end of year$226$305During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized $17, $27and $57, respectively, of interest and penalties in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations. We file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is resolved by settlement or statute of limitations. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash. If the uncertain tax positions we have accrued for are sustained by the taxing authorities in our favor, the reduction of the liability will reduce our effective tax rate. We reasonably expect reductions in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and interest and penalties of approximately $337within the next twelve months due to the expiration of statutes of limitation in foreign jurisdictions.We are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, and foreign examinations for years before 2011, 2010 and 2007, respectively. We do not anticipate that any potential tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.During 2014, we were under examination in Japan for the tax years 2011 through 2013. The tax examination did not result in a material impact on the Company financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We were not subject to, nor had we received any notice of, income tax examinations in our other jurisdictions as of December 31, 2014.NOTE 7.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESRoyaltiesWe license technology from third parties and have agreed to pay certain suppliers a royalty based on the number of chips sold or manufactured, the net sales price of the chips containing the licensed technology or a fixed non-cancelable fee. Royalty expense is recognized based on our estimated average unit cost for royalty contracts with non-cancelable prepayments and the stated contractual per unit rate for all other agreements. Royalty expense was $977, $1,094and $1,386for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which is included in cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations60401k PlanWe sponsor a 401k plan for eligible employees. Participants may defer a percentage of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis, not to exceed the dollar limit that is set by law. A discretionary matching contribution by the Company is allowed and is equal to a uniform percentage of the amount of salary reduction elected to be deferred, which percentage will be determined each year by the Company. We made no contributions to the 401k plan during the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 or 2012.LeasesWe acquire rights to use certain software engineer design tools under software licenses, accounting for such arrangements is similar to capital leases.Our various office space and equipment leases are classified as operating leases. Certain of our leases for office space contain provisions under which monthly rent escalates over time and certain leases also contain provisions for reimbursement of a specified amount of leasehold improvements. When lease agreements contain escalating rent clauses, we recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. When lease agreements provide allowances for leasehold improvements, we capitalize the leasehold improvement assets and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset, and reduce rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease by the amount of the asset capitalized. When lease agreements provide rent holidays, we reduce rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease by the amount of the rent holiday. As of December31, 2014, future minimum payments under non-cancelable software licenses and operating lease agreements are as follows:Year Ending December31,Software licensesOperating  Interest component206Present value of minimum software license payments2,794Less: Current portion1,744Long-term portion of obligations$1,050Rent expense for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $1,740, $1,822and $1,976, respectively.Contract ManufacturersIn the normal course of business, we commit to purchase products from our contract manufacturers to be delivered within the next 90 days. In certain situations, should we cancel an order, we could be required to pay cancellation fees. Such obligations could impact our immediate results of operations but would not materially affect our  of our agreements include limited indemnification provisions for claims from third-parties relating to our intellectual property. It is not possible for us to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments or indemnification costs under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. We have not made any payments under these agreements in the past, and as of December31, 2014, we have not incurred any material liabilities arising from these indemnification obligations. In the future, however, such obligations could immediately impact our results of operations but are not expected to materially affect our business61Legal ProceedingsWe are subject to legal matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although we currently believe that resolving such matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, our results of operations, or our cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and our view of these matters may change in the future.NOTE 8.EARNINGS PER SHAREBasic earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.Diluted weighted average shares outstanding include the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period.The following schedule reconciles the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share in thousands, except per share data:Year Ended December31,201420132012Net  used in computing net loss per share - basic and diluted 22,76619,81618,252Net loss per common share - basic and  following weighted average shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive in thousands:Year Ended  equity incentive  dilutive common shares from employee equity incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan.

Our shareholders approved increases to the total authorized shares of 1,000,000, 1,000,000, 1,000,000, 1,000,000, 1,150,000, and 1,000,000on May 15, 2014, May 9, 2013, May 15, 2012, May18, 2010, May19, 2009, and May 20, 2008, respectively, increasing the total authorized shares available for issuance as equity awards to 7,483,333shares. The 2006 Plan replaced our previously existing stock incentive plans including our 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, our 2001 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan, the Equator Technologies, Inc. 1996 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, and Equator Technologies, Inc. stand-alone option plans collectively, Old Stock Incentive Plans. Upon adoption of the 2006 Plan, no additional options could be issued under the Old Stock Incentive Plans, although awards previously granted under the Old Stock Incentive Plans remain outstanding according to their original terms. As of December31, 2014, 222,575shares were available for grant under the 2006 Plan.Stock OptionsOptions granted must generally be exercised while the individual is an employee. In May 2009, the 2006 Plan was modified to reduce the contractual life of newly issued stock awards from tento sixyears. Our new hire vesting schedule provides that each option becomes exercisable at a rate of 25%on the first anniversary date of the grant and 2083%on the last day of every month thereafter for a total of 36additional increments. Our merit vesting schedule provides that merit-type awards become exercisable monthly over a period of threeyears.The following is a summary of stock option activity:Number  outstanding as of December 31,  and  outstanding as of December 31, 2014:3,335,574$334The following table summarizes information about options outstanding as of December31, 2014:Options OutstandingOptions ExercisableRange of exercise  -  -  -  -  -  -  the years ended December31, 2014, 2013and 2012the total intrinsic value of options exercised was $979, $112and $251, respectively, for which no income tax benefit has been recorded because a full valuation allowance has been provided for our U.S. deferred tax assets.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP for U.S. employees and for certain foreign subsidiary employees. The ESPP provides for separate offering periods commencing on February1 and August1, with the first offering period beginning August1, 2010. Each offering period continues for a period of 18months with purchases every six months. Each eligible employee may purchase up to 3,000shares of stock on each purchase date, with a maximum annual purchase amount of $25.The purchase price is equal to 85%of the lesser of the fair market value of the shares on the offering date or on the purchase date. A total of 1,300,000shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the ESPP. During the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we issued 101,201, 101,068and 96,299shares, respectively for proceeds of $274, $198and $186, respectively, under the ESPP. 64Stock-Based Compensation ExpenseThe fair value of stock-based compensation was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted average  Option Plans:Risk free interest rate164%108%079%Expected dividend yield0%0%0%Expected term in  Stock Purchase Plan:Risk free interest rate022%019%019%Expected dividend yield0%0%0%Expected term in  weighted average fair value of options granted during the years ended December31, 2014, 2013and 2012was $350, $196and $179, respectively. The risk free interest rate is estimated using an average of treasury bill interest rates. The expected dividend yield is zero as we have not paid any dividends to date and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected term as this represents our best estimate of future volatility. Subsequent to the May 2009 amendment of our 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, which shortened the contractual life of newly issued stock options from ten to six years, we have elected to use the simplified method to estimate expected term. Under the simplified method, an option expected term is calculated as the average of its vesting period and original contractual life. The expected term of ESPP purchase rights is based on the estimated weighted average time to purchase.As of December31, 2014, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense is $3,794, which is expected to be recognized as stock-based compensation expense over a weighted average period of 153years65NOTE 11.SEGMENT INFORMATIONWe have identified a single operating segment: the design and development of ICs for use in electronic display devices.
