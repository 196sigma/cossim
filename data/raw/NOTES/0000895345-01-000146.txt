Item 8, should be read as an integral part of the financial highlights and
the following financial review.
COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000
WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999
NET SALES
Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased $2011
million or 27% to $9500 million, from 1999. The increase in net sales was
primarily driven by strong sales of broadband and fiber optic cable for HFC
applications. Higher sales volume, combined with price increases on certain
HFC products, accounted for the majority of the year-over-year sales
increase.

Total worldwide sales     $9500   1000%  $7489   1000%
For the year ended December 31, 2000, international sales increased
31% compared to 1999, due mainly to robust demand for HFC products around
the world, with particular strength in the Latin American region. We
purchased a manufacturing facility in Brazil during 2000 where we expect to
begin production in the second half of 2001 to help us meet the expected
demand for HFC and wireless products in Latin America.
Net sales to cable television and other video distribution markets
CATV/Video Products for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased
$1757 million or 32% to an all-time record of $7331 million, from 1999.
The increase in sales of CATV/Video Products resulted primarily from strong
sales of broadband cable to telecommunications companies and cable
television system operators. Domestic CATV/Video sales grew approximately
32% year over year, led by strong sales of fiber optic cable. We believe
that our ability to offer both coaxial and fiber optic cable continues to
be an important competitive advantage.
Net sales for wireless and other telecommunications products
Wireless and Other Telecom Products for the year ended December 31,
2000 increased $274 million or 26% to $1316 million, from 1999. This
increase was primarily due to growth in sales of both telephone central
office products and our newest-generation wireless cables. While we expect
our Cell ReachR product for wireless applications to be a substantial
contributor to our long-term growth, we continue to experience pricing
pressure and aggressive competition in the wireless market. In response to
these pressures, we have improved performance in certain existing products,
broadened our product portfolio, begun establishing international sales and
manufacturing capabilities, and substantially completed capacity additions
at our Newton, North Carolina facility which have enhanced our
manufacturing efficiencies. We also expect increasing competitive pressures
for our other telecommunications products, which primarily represent
coaxial cables designed for switching and transmission applications for
enhanced telecommunications services.
Net sales for local area network and other data applications LAN
Products for the year ended December 31, 2000 decreased $20 million or
2% to $853 million, from 1999. This decrease was due primarily to a
buildup of distribution channel inventory in the first half of 2000, which
slowed sales in the second half of the year, and lower prices for LAN
Products. We began implementing a comprehensive performance improvement
plan for our LAN Products group during the fourth quarter of 2000. This
plan included reorganizing LAN sales and operational management as well as
ongoing efforts to reduce distribution channel inventory, improve
efficiency, and increase the velocity of the manufacturing and distribution
cycle.
GROSS PROFIT NET SALES LESS COST OF SALES
Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $2511 million,
compared to $2001 million for 1999, an increase of 25%. Gross profit
margins decreased slightly to 264% for the year ended December 31, 2000,
compared to gross profit margins of 267% for 1999.
While price increases for HFC products had a positive effect on gross
profit margins during 2000, they were more than offset by the combination
of lower prices for LAN Products, the rising cost of key materials, and
reduced
15 manufacturing efficiency resulting from capacity expansions. In addition,
we are continuing to make improvements in the gross profit margins at our
Belgium facility.
During 2000, supplies of key materials, such as bimetallic center
conductors and optical fiber were tight. A major focus for us continues to
be the acceleration of internal production of bimetallic center conductors
for coaxial cables. While the ramp up of production has progressed slower
than anticipated, we made significant progress improving output in this
project in the second half of 2000. In addition, we have secured a supply
arrangement with our current supplier for bimetallic center conductors for
calendar year 2001 and are working toward a longer-term arrangement with
them.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE
Selling, general and administrative SG expense for the year
ended December 31, 2000 was $812 million, compared to $689 million for
1999. As a percentage of net sales, SG expense was 85% for the year
ended December 31, 2000 compared to 92% for the year ended December 31,
1999. The absolute amount of SG expense increased over the prior period
as a result of the expansion of sales and marketing efforts to support
developing products and sales growth targets. However, as a percentage of
sales, SG expense decreased in 2000, compared to 1999, as a result of
effective cost management efforts.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development expense as a percentage of net sales
increased to 19% for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to 11%
for the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase was primarily due to
our vertical integration projects for bimetallic wire fabrication and fine
wire drawing. We have ongoing programs to develop new products and market
opportunities for our products and core capabilities and new manufacturing
technologies to achieve cost reductions.
OTHER INCOME, NET
Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2000 includes a
pretax gain of $517 thousand related to the final liquidation of a closed
Australian joint venture. This joint venture was completely dissolved as of
December 29, 2000, when the deregistration period required by the
Australian legal authorities expired.
NET INTEREST EXPENSE
Net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $97
million, compared to $96 million for 1999. Our weighted average effective
rate on outstanding borrowings, including amortization of associated loan
fees, was 514% as of December 31, 2000, compared to 482% as of December
31, 1999.
INCOME TAXES
Our effective tax rate was 38% for the year ended December 31, 2000
and 37% for 1999. This slight increase was due primarily to the dilution of
our foreign sales corporation tax benefit, a result of strong domestic
sales and increasing sales from our Belgium facility, and higher tax rates
in foreign jurisdictions, particularly Belgium. We expect the effective tax
rate for 2001 to decrease to approximately 37% as a result of certain tax
savings strategies.
16 COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999
WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998
NET SALES
Net sales for the year ended December 31, 1999 increased $1772
million or 31% to $7489 million, from 1998. The increase in net sales was
primarily driven by strong broadband cable sales to domestic
telecommunications companies and solid growth in all key product
categories. The following table presents in millions our revenues by
product line as well as domestic versus international sales for the years
ended December 31, 1999 and 1998                   1999  % of 1999  1998    % of

Domestic sales           $5712   763%  $4319   756%
International sales         1777   237   1398   244
Total worldwide sales     $7489   1000%  $5717   1000%
For the year ended December 31, 1999, international sales increased
27% compared to 1998, due mainly to the acquisition of our coaxial cable
business in Belgium and improving sales in the Asia/Pacific Rim region.
Net sales of CATV/Video Products for the year ended December 31, 1999
increased $1002 million or 22% to $5574 million, from 1998. The increase
in sales of CATV/Video Products resulted primarily from strong sales of
broadband cable to domestic telecommunications companies and cable
television system operators. Domestic CATV/Video sales grew approximately
20% year over year. This performance reflects increased activity during
1999 in the upgrade of broadband networks for multi-channel video, voice
and high-speed Internet access.
Net sales of Wireless and Other Telecom Products for the year ended
December 31, 1999 were $1042 million as compared to $397 million in 1998.
This substantial year-over-year increase reflects strong growth in both
sales of Cell ReachR for wireless applications and sales of other
telecommunications products. Sales of Cell Reach products more than
quadrupled year over year. Sales of other telecommunications products more
than doubled year over year.
Net sales of LAN Products for the year ended December 31, 1999
increased $125 million or 17% to $873 million, from 1998. During 1999,
capacity constraints limited growth in sales of certain LAN Products.
During the second half of 1999, we expanded our production capacity for
enhanced bandwidth cables and began a 137,500-square-foot expansion of our
Claremont, North Carolina facility, in part to support sales growth in LAN
Products.
GROSS PROFIT NET SALES LESS COST OF SALES
Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $2001 million,
compared to $1346 million for 1998, an increase of 49%. Gross profit
margins improved to 267% for the year ended December 31, 1999, compared to
gross profit margins of 235% for 1998. The primary drivers of the
improvement in gross profit and gross profit margins were   o  increased sales volumes and favorable product mix   o  improving Cell Reach profitability; and
o  aggressive cost reduction efforts, primarily through engineered
manufacturing efficiencies including vertical integration
projects.
17   These improvements were somewhat offset by lower prices for certain
LAN Products and the acquisition of our Belgium facility. This facility,
while profitable and improving, had lower than our average margins in 1999.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE
SG expense for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $689 million,
compared to $528 million for 1998. As a percentage of net sales, SG
expense was 9% for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998. The absolute
amount of SG expense increased over the prior period as a result of the
expansion of sales and marketing efforts to support developing products and
sales growth targets.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development expense as a percentage of net sales remained
steady at 1% for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998.
GAIN ON SALE OF ASSETS
In February 1998, we sold certain real and personal property and
inventories of our high temperature aerospace and industrial cable business
to Alcatel NA Cable Systems, Inc. for an adjusted price of $13 million. We
recognized a pretax gain from the sale of $19 million or $002 per basic
and diluted share, net of tax effect.
OTHER INCOME, NET
In December 1998, we recorded a pretax benefit of $20 million, or
$004 per basic and diluted share, net of tax effect, related to the
partial reversal of 1997 after-tax charges associated with our closed
Australian joint venture.
NET INTEREST EXPENSE
Net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $96
million, compared to $149 million for 1998. The decrease in net interest
costs was primarily due to the lower amount of weighted average outstanding
borrowings under our revolving credit agreement during 1999. In addition,
all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement were repaid
in December 1999 with proceeds from the issuance of our convertible notes,
which carry a lower effective interest rate. This reduction in interest
expense was partially offset during the year ended December 31, 1999 by
interest expense on new borrowings of 15 million euros equivalent to $164
million at the date of borrowing.
INCOME TAXES
Our effective tax rate was 37% for the year ended December 31, 1999
and 35% for 1998. This fluctuation in our effective tax rate was partly due
to the strength in 1999 domestic versus international sales, which diluted
the impact of our foreign sales corporation tax benefit. In addition, the
1998 rate included a benefit of 1% from the reversal of a valuation
allowance established in 1997 for charges associated with the closing of
our Australian joint venture.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash provided by operations was $449 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000, compared to $794 million for 1999, a decrease of $345
million, or 43%. This decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to
an increase in accounts receivable and inventories.
Working capital was $2091 million at December 31, 2000, compared to
$1470 million at December 31, 1999. The increase in working capital was
primarily due to increased accounts receivable, which resulted from higher
sales volume and was also impacted by an increase in our days sales
outstanding. In addition, working capital was impacted by increased
inventories, due in part to our vertical integration activities and efforts
to build up supplies of key raw materials.
During the year ended December 31, 2000, we invested $986 million in
equipment and facilities compared to $571 million in 1999. We increased
capital spending during 2000 to support vertical integration projects,
capacity expansion, and equipment upgrades to meet increased current and
anticipated future business demands. As of December 31, 2000, we had
committed funds of approximately $225 million under purchase orders and
contracts related to these projects. We expect capital expenditures for
equipment and facilities in 2001 to be approximately $90-100 million, with
the majority of funds expected to be invested in global capacity expansion
projects.
18   During 2000, we made an investment of approximately $38 million in a
wireless infrastructure project management company. We utilized an
additional $170 million during the year ended December 31, 1999 to acquire
Alcatel coaxial cable business in Belgium. During the year ended December
31, 1998, we received initial cash proceeds of $97 million related to the
sale of our high temperature aerospace and industrial cable business.
Our principal sources of liquidity both on a short-term and long-term
basis are cash flows provided by operations and funds available under
long-term credit facilities. As of December 31, 2000, we had $320 million
of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement which
expires in December 2002. We owed total long-term debt of $2274 million,
or 38% of our book capital structure, defined as long-term debt and total
stockholders' equity, as of December 31, 2000, compared to $1984 million,
or 41% of our book capital structure, as of December 31, 1999. The increase
in long-term debt during 2000 was due to additional borrowings under our
revolving credit agreement to finance working capital needs and increased
capital expenditures necessary to support vertical integration projects,
expand capacity, and upgrade equipment, among other things.
Based upon analysis of our consolidated financial position and the
expected results of our operations in the future, we believe that we will
have sufficient cash flows from future operations and the financial
flexibility to attract both short-term and long-term capital on acceptable
terms as may be needed to fund operations, capital expenditures and other
growth objectives and to support principal and interest payment
requirements on our outstanding long-term indebtedness. There can be no
assurance, however, that future industry-specific developments, general
economic trends or other situations will not adversely affect our
operations or ability to meet cash requirements.
MARKET RISK
We have established a risk management strategy that includes the
reasonable use of derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our
exposure to market risks resulting from adverse fluctuations in commodity
prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Derivative
financial instruments which may be utilized by us, include commodity
pricing contracts, foreign currency exchange contracts, and contracts
hedging exposure to interest rates. Our policy is to designate all
derivatives as hedges and to account for the derivatives in the same manner
as the item being hedged. Through December 31, 2000, such derivatives were
not recognized as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes,
nor do we engage in speculation.
Materials, in their finished form, account for a large portion of our
cost of sales. These materials are fabricated from commodity products that
are openly traded on exchange markets and are subject to significant
potential changes in market prices. Increases in the prices of certain
commodity products could result in higher overall production costs.
We primarily bill customers in foreign countries in US dollars.
However, a significant decline in the value of currencies used in certain
regions of the world as compared to the US dollar can adversely affect
product sales in those regions because our products may become more
expensive for those customers to pay for in their local currency. The 1999
acquisition of our Belgian subsidiary created a specific market risk that a
decline in the value of the Belgian franc or the euro compared to the US
dollar could adversely affect our net investment in that subsidiary. Our
Eurodollar Credit Agreement, which is denominated in euros, serves as a
partial hedge of our net investment in the Belgian subsidiary. Our
investment in Brazil during 2000 created a new foreign subsidiary and a
specific market risk that a decline in the value of the Brazilian real
compared to the US dollar could adversely affect our net investment in that
subsidiary. We are evaluating alternatives to help us reasonably manage the
market risk of our net investment in the Brazilian operation.
As of December 31, 2000, the only derivative financial instrument
outstanding was an interest rate swap agreement that serves as a fixed-rate
hedge of the variable-rate borrowings under our Eurodollar Credit
Agreement, as required under the covenants of this term loan. The fair
value of the interest rate swap agreement outstanding at December 31, 2000
was not material to our financial position. At December 31, 2000, we were
in the process of evaluating hedging alternatives related to foreign
currency exchange exposures. In addition, we evaluated our commodity
pricing exposures and concluded that it was not currently beneficial to use
derivative financial instruments to hedge our current commodity price
risks.
Our nonderivative financial instruments consist primarily of cash and
cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, and debt instruments.
At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the book values of each of the financial
19 instruments recorded on our balance sheet were considered representative of
their respective fair values due to their variable interest rates and / or
short terms to maturity, with the exception of our convertible debt, which
was recorded in the financial statements at $1725 million, but had a fair
value of $1225 million at December 31, 2000. Fair value of our debt is
estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on our current
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of arrangements, or quoted
market prices whenever available.
The following tables summarize our market risks associated with
long-term debt and foreign currency exposure as of December 31, 2000 and
1999. The tables present principal cash outflows and related interest rates

We continually attempt to minimize any effect of inflation on earnings
by controlling our operating costs and selling prices. During the past few
years, the rate of inflation has been low and has not had a material impact
on our results of operations.
The principal raw materials purchased by us fabricated aluminum,
plastics, bimetals, copper and optical fiber are subject to changes in
market price as these materials are linked to the commodity markets. To the
extent that we are unable to pass on cost increases to customers, the cost
increases could have a significant impact on the results of our operations.
20 OTHER
We are either a plaintiff or a defendant in pending legal matters in
the normal course of business; however, we believe none of these legal
matters will have a materially adverse effect on our financial statements
upon final disposition. In addition, we are subject to various federal,
state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the use, discharge
and disposal of hazardous materials. Our manufacturing facilities are
believed to be in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations.
Compliance with current laws and regulations has not had, and is not
expected to have, a materially adverse effect on our financial statements.
NEWLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE
INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, as amended by SFAS No. 137, ACCOUNTING
FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES--DEFERRAL OF THE
EFFECTIVE DATE FOR FASB STATEMENT NO. 133 and SFAS No. 138, ACCOUNTING FOR
CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND CERTAIN HEDGING ACTIVITIES. SFAS No.
133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative financial instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as embedded
derivatives and for hedging activities. The new standards require an
entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the
statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair
value. The adoption of SFAS No. 133, as amended, did not have a material
impact on CommScope consolidated results of operations, financial
position, and cash flows as of January 1, 2001.
EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION -- EURO
On January 1, 1999, several member countries of the European Monetary
Union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign
currencies, and adopted the euro as their new common legal currency. As of
that date, the euro began trading on currency exchanges. The legacy
currencies of the participating countries will remain legal tender for a
transition period between January 1, 1999 and January 1, 2002. We conduct
business in member countries.
During the transition period, cashless payments for example, wire
transfers can be made in the euro, and parties to individual transactions
can elect to pay for goods and services using either the euro or the legacy
currency. Between January 1, 2002 and July 1, 2002, the participating
countries will introduce euro notes and coins and eventually withdraw all
legacy currencies so that they will no longer be available.
We are addressing the issues involved with the introduction of the
euro. Among the issues facing us are the assessment and conversion of
information technology systems to allow for transactions to take place in
both the legacy currencies and the euro and the eventual elimination of
legacy currencies. In addition, we are reviewing certain existing contracts
for potential modification and assessing our pricing/marketing strategies
in the affected European markets.
Based on current information, we do not expect that the euro
conversion will have a materially adverse effect on our business, results
of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
On January 2, 2000, we began the implementation of a new integrated
information management system. Our goal for this new computer-based system
is to help us improve business practices, allow faster access to
information and ultimately enable us to service our customers better in the
future, among other things.
However, during 2000 we experienced some transition issues in
connection with this new information system, but they did not have a
material impact on our results of operations, liquidity or financial
condition for the full year 2000. We have made progress incorporating our
new information system into our business model and expect to reap its full
benefits over the longer term. However, we cannot assure you that we will
incur no future issues with this system.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
