These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Optimal Group Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles. 
Canadian generally accepted accounting principles vary in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Information relating to the nature and effect of such differences is presented in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Optimal Group Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated March 13, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting. s/ KPMG LLP

March 13, 2006 40 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors of Optimal Group Inc.
We have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A of Optimal Group Inc.s the Company Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Company management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over the financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 41 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, management assessment that Optimal Group Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Also, in our opinion, Optimal Group Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Optimal Group Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, deficit and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2005, and our report dated March13, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. s/ KPMG LLP Chartered Accountants Montral, Canada

The Company business activities consist of providing payment processing services in the online gaming and non-gaming industries, and hardware maintenance and repair outsourcing services. 2. Basis of presentation As a result of the sale of the U.S. field maintenance service division, which includes Systech Retail Systems referred to in note 5 d and the sale of U-Scan self-checkout business referred to in note5g, the results of discontinued operations are included in the net earnings loss, but presented separately under discontinued operations for current and prior years. The balance sheet separately presents the current and long-term assets and liabilities related to the discontinued operations for the current and prior years. 3. Significant accounting policies These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Canada. These principles conform, in all material respects, with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, except as described in note25. The significant accounting policies of the Company are summarized as follows a Principles of consolidation These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company wholly-owned subsidiaries and its 762% owned subsidiary, FireOne Group plc. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. b Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and balances with financial institutions, and highly liquid debt instruments with original terms to maturity of three months or less. c Short-term investments Short-term investments include investments with maturities of less than a year, as well as investments with maturities greater than a year that can be promptly liquidated. Investments are carried at the lower of amortized cost and market value. d Cash and short-term investments held as reserves The Company has agreements with various financial institutions for the settlement of payment transactions. Under the terms of these agreements, the Company is required to maintain certain amounts as reserves, which may be applied against any amounts for which the financial institutions would be entitled to reimbursement. Certain amounts charged by the financial institutions are charged to the Companys customers. 48 OPTIMAL GROUP INC.

expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per-share amounts 3. Significant accounting policies continued e Settlement assets Settlement assets result from timing differences in the Companys settlement process. These timing differences arise primarily as a result of settlement amounts due from financial institutions representing the card associations and debit networks. These amounts are typically funded to the Company within days from the transaction processing date. f Customer reserves and security deposits Customer reserves and security deposits include balances required from merchants in the payments segment to provide for amounts for which the Company would be entitled to reimbursement under its contractual arrangements. Customer reserves and security deposits relate to merchant collateral and outstanding payments due to merchants and customers. g Inventory To provide maintenance and repair services to its customers, the Company maintains an inventory of replacement parts. Parts are stated at cost weighted average. The Company provides an allowance for obsolescence and shrinkage. The costs of refurbishing parts are included in the service costs as incurred.
Periodic revisions to allowance estimates are required, based upon the evaluation of several factors, including changes in estimated product life cycles, usage levels, and technology changes. Changes in these estimates are reflected immediately in income. h Research and investment tax credits Research and investment tax credits are recorded as a reduction of the related expense or the cost of the assets acquired. Tax credits are given recognition when reasonable assurance exists that they will be realized. i Property and equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Assets under capital leases are recorded at the present value of minimum lease payments. Amortization is provided for over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method at the following annual rates Computer equipment and software 33% - 50 Equipment 10% - 33 Leasehold improvements Lease term 49 OPTIMAL GROUP INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued Three-year period ended December 31, 2005
expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per-share amounts 3. Significant accounting policies continued j Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill is the residual amount that results when the purchase price of an acquired business exceeds the sum of the amounts allocated to the assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, based on their fair values. Goodwill is allocated as of the date of the business combination to the Company reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination.
Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The impairment test is carried out in two steps. In the first step, the carrying amount of the reporting unit is compared with its fair value. When the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is not required. The second step is performed when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, in which case, the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is compared with its carrying amount to measure the impairment loss, if any. When the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to
the excess and is presented as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of operations.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired either individually or with a group of other assets are initially recognized and measured at cost. The cost of a group of intangible assets, including those acquired in a business combination that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill, is allocated to the individual assets based on their relative fair values. 
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over the following periods Customer contracts, relationships and service agreements 24 - 84 months Acquired technology 60 months Supplier contract 36 - 84 months ISO/ISA relations 84 months 50 OPTIMAL GROUP INC.

expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per-share amounts 3. Significant accounting policies continued j Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Other intangible assets continued As at December 31, 2005, estimated amortization expense for each of the next five years is expected to be as follows 2006 11,974 2007 11,808 2008 11,463 2009 9,951 2010 9,452 Estimated future amortization expense is based on intangible amounts recorded as of December31, 2005. Actual amounts will increase if additional amortizable intangible assets are acquired. k Impairment of long-lived assets Long-lived assets, consisting of property and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, which is established as the carrying amount of an asset to be held and used over the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected from its use and disposal; the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Fair value is the estimated value at which the asset could be bought or sold in a transaction between willing parties. l Asset retirement obligations The Company recognizes the fair value of a future asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that results from the acquisition, construction, development, and/or normal use of the assets. The Company concurrently recognizes a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset. The fair value of the asset retirement obligation is estimated using the expected cash flow approach that reflects a range of possible outcomes discounted at a credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Subsequent to the initial measurement, the asset retirement obligation is adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation. Changes in the obligation due to
the passage of time are recognized in income as an operating expense using the interest method. Changes in the obligation due to changes in estimated cash flows are recognized as an adjustment of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset that is depreciated over the remaining life of the asset. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had no asset retirement obligations. 51 OPTIMAL GROUP INC.

expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per-share amounts 3. Significant accounting policies continued m Income taxes The Company provides for income taxes using the asset and liability method of tax allocation. Under this method, future income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on deductible or taxable temporary differences between financial statement values and tax values of assets and liabilities using enacted or substantively enacted income tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
The Company establishes a valuation allowance against future income tax assets if, based on available information, it is more likely than not that some or all of the future income tax assets will not be realized. n Revenue recognition The majority of payment service revenues are generated from fees charged to merchants for payment processing services as well as from consumers who utilize the Company electronic wallet offering. Merchants are charged a discount fee or rate, which is based upon the merchants monthly charge volume and risk profile, and this fee is calculated as a percentage of the dollar amount of each transaction. Higher discount rates are charged for card-not-present transactions than for card-present transactions in order to compensate for the higher cost of underwriting and managing the increased chargeback risk associated with such transactions. The balance of payment service revenues are derived from a variety of fixed transaction or services fees, including set-up fees, fees for monthly minimum charge volume requirements, statement fees, annual fees and fees for other miscellaneous services, such as
handling chargebacks. Consumers who utilize the electronic wallet are charged a fixed transaction fee for each deposit made to their account. Discount and other fees related to payment transactions are recognized at the time the merchants transactions are processed. Revenues derived from service fees are recognized at the time the service is performed. Revenues from set-up fees are deferred and amortized over the expected term of the merchant relationship, which is approximately five years. 
Where the Company is the primary party responsible for providing payment processing services, revenue is recorded on a gross basis and amounts paid to the acquiring processing suppliers are recorded as part of transaction processing expenses. Where the Company is not the primary party in providing a merchant with payment processing services, the Company records revenue net of amounts paid to the acquiring processing supplier.
Revenues from repair services are recognized at the time the services are rendered. Revenues from maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the contract. 52 OPTIMAL GROUP INC.

expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per-share amounts 3. Significant accounting policies continued o Reserve for losses on merchant accounts Disputes between a cardholder and a merchant periodically arise as a result of, among other things, consumer dissatisfaction with merchandise quality or merchant services. Such disputes may not be resolved in the merchants favor. In these cases, the transaction may be charged back to the merchant, which means the transaction amount is refunded to the consumer and, in certain instances, charged to the merchant. If the merchant has insufficient funds, the Company must bear the credit risk for the full amount of the transaction. There are contracts which include financial guarantees that represent a form of insurance arrangement, and are accounted for as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee. Management evaluates the risk for such
transactions and estimates the loss for disputed transactions based primarily on historical experience and other relevant factors.
A reserve is maintained for merchant losses necessary to absorb chargebacks and other losses for merchant transactions that have been previously processed and on which revenues have been recorded. Management analyzes the adequacy of its reserve for merchant losses in each reporting period. The reserve for merchant losses comprises specifically identifiable reserves for merchant transactions for which losses can be estimated and an estimate of loss in the remaining portfolio based on experience.
The reserve for losses on merchant accounts is decreased by merchant losses arising from chargebacks and is increased by provisions for merchant losses, net of any recoveries. The net charge for the provision for merchant losses is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. As at December 31, 2005 and 2004, the reserve for losses on merchant accounts is included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities. p Foreign currency translation The functional currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar and, accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars. Monetary assets and liabilities of the Canadian and foreign operations denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet dates. Other assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates prevailing when the assets were acquired or the liabilities incurred. Revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average rate of exchange in effect for the period during which the transaction occurred. Foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the determination of net earnings. q Research and development expenses Research costs, which include all costs incurred to establish technological feasibility, are charged to operations in the period in which they are incurred. Once technological feasibility has been established, development costs are evaluated for deferral and subsequent amortization over the estimated period of benefit. As at December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had no deferred development costs. 53 OPTIMAL GROUP INC.

Significant accounting policies continued r Stock-based compensation Effective January 1, 2003, the fair value-based method is used to account for all transactions whereby goods and services are received in exchange for stock-based compensation and other stock-based payments. Under the fair value-based method, compensation cost is measured at fair value at the date of grant and is expensed over the awards vesting periods. Previously, the Company applied the settlement method of accounting for employee stock options. Under the settlement method, any consideration paid by employees on the exercise of stock options was credited to share capital and no compensation expense was recognized.
The following disclosure is required to report the pro forma net earnings loss and earnings loss per share as if the fair value-based method had been used to account for employee stock options granted during fiscal 2002. The pro forma adjustment for fiscal 2003 relates to the amortization of the remaining balance of compensation cost for stock options granted during fiscal 2002 due to the cancellation of all options outstanding in July 2003. 2005 2004 2003 Net earnings loss, as reported 577 9,253 6,168 Deduct Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value-based method for all awards granted in fiscal 2002, net of related taxes of nil 1,424 Pro forma net earnings loss 577 9,253 7,592 Earnings loss per share Basic As reported 003 046 041 Pro forma 003 046 051 Diluted As reported 002 046 041 Pro forma 002 046 051 54 OPTIMAL GROUP INC.

Significant accounting policies continued r Stock-based compensation continued The weighted average fair value of the 1,765,000 options granted during fiscal 2002, estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions, was $1149 per share Risk-free interest rate 332 Expected volatility 81 Expected life in years 10 Expected dividend rate 0 Dividend yield was excluded from the calculation, since it is the present policy of the Company to retain all earnings to finance operations. s Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are determined using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share are calculated using the treasury stock method. Diluted earnings per share are computed in a manner consistent with basic earnings per share, except that the weighted average shares outstanding are increased to include additional shares from the assumed exercise of options and warrants, if dilutive. The number of additional shares is calculated by assuming that outstanding options and warrants were exercised, and that the proceeds from such exercises are used to repurchase Class A shares at the average market price during the reporting period. t Guarantees In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various agreements that may contain features that meet the definition of a guarantee. A guarantee is defined to be a contract including an indemnity that contingently requires the Company to make payments to a third party based on i changes in an underlying interest rate, foreign exchange rate, equity or commodity instrument, index or other variable that is related to an asset, a liability or an equity security of the guaranteed party, ii failure of another party to perform under an obligating agreement, or iii failure of another party to pay its indebtedness when due.
A liability is recorded when the Company considers it probable that a payment relating to a guarantee has to be made to the other party of the contract or agreement. 55 OPTIMAL GROUP INC.

expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per-share amounts 3. Significant accounting policies continued u Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions include determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and reserves for losses on merchant accounts, estimating the useful lives of long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, estimating the fair value of identifiable intangibles acquired in a business acquisition, estimating stock-based compensation costs, as well as assessing the recoverability of inventories, goodwill, long-lived assets, research and development tax credits receivable and
future tax assets. The reported amounts and note disclosures are determined to reflect the most probable set of economic conditions and planned courses of action. Financial results as determined by actual events could differ from those estimates. 4. FireOne Group plc In April2005, the Company created FireOne Groupplc FireOne and transferred to this newly-created, wholly-owned Irish subsidiary and its subsidiaries the net assets of the payments processing business related to online gaming previously held in Optimal Payments Inc. and its subsidiaries. On May27, 2005, the Company completed the placing of 10 million ordinary shares of FireOne, representing a 20% interest, with institutional and other shareholders. The Company received gross proceeds of $44,146 241 million as a result of this transaction. The ordinary shares of FireOne were admitted for trading on the Alternative Investment Market AIM of the London Stock Exchange plc on June 2, 2005.
The Company recognized a gain on sale of its 20% interest in FireOne of $30,411, net of transaction costs of $6,643. The non-controlling interest in these assets at the date of the transaction was $7,092.
As a result of the internal reorganization to transfer the payments processing business related to online gaming to FireOne and its subsidiaries, the Company incurred a tax charge of $13,732, of which approximately $2,400 represents taxes currently payable and the remainder represents the utilization of future tax assets and investment tax credits previously recognized. Taxes paid or incurred as a result of the transfer of net assets to FireOne and its subsidiaries have been recorded as an Other asset in the consolidated balance sheets and will be recognized when the Company interest in FireOne is transferred, by sale or otherwise, outside of the consolidated group.
For 2005, the Company amortized $2,746 of this asset as a future tax expense as a result of the sale of a 20% interest held by the Company referred to above. In addition, the Company interest in FireOne was effectively diluted to 762% from 80% as a result of the vesting of the restricted share units issued by FireOne as discussed in note 15 a. As a result, the Company amortized a further $524 of this Other asset as a future tax expense and recorded a dilution loss of $1,619, which is included in Non-controlling interest in the consolidated statements of operations. As at December 31, 2005, the balance of Other asset, net of amortization, is $10,462. 56 OPTIMAL GROUP INC.

Effective April 6, 2004, the Company completed a Combination Agreement with Terra Payments Inc. Terra, a publicly-traded company that offered proprietary technology and services to businesses to accept credit card, electronic check and direct debit payments. Terra processed credit card payments for non-face-to-face transactions, including mail-order/telephone order, online gaming and other online merchants, as well as for retail point-of-sale merchants. Terra also processed checks and direct debits online and by telephone. The primary reasons for the Companys acquisition of Terra and the primary factors that contributed to a purchase price that resulted in recognition of goodwill include its industry position, management strength, earnings prospects and ability to serve as a platform for potential strategic acquisitions for enhanced growth and profitability in this segment.
The agreement was a stock-for-stock merger in which 04532 of the Company Class A shares were exchanged for each share of Terra. The total purchase price of $66,005 was paid through the issuance of 7,242,168 Class A shares, the acquisition of outstanding options and warrants issued by Terra and transaction costs of the Company. 63 OPTIMAL GROUP INC.

Fujitsu, including all related tangible assets, intellectual property rights, and obligations, for $35,000 in cash plus the assumption of liabilities. Fujitsu funded the payment of a termination fee owed by the Company to NCR Corporation NCR as a result of the termination of their offer to purchase the self-checkout business. Subsequent to April 8, 2004, the Company paid an amount of $4,806 to Fujitsu due to purchase price adjustments mainly attributed to there being less net assets sold to Fujitsu as the Company collected a large portion of the accounts receivable and realized the cash thereon in advance of the sale. Thus, the net proceeds realized on the sale to Fujitsu were $30,194.
The sale of the U-Scan self-checkout business is consistent with the Companys strategy to reposition the business as a payments and services leader. As a result of weak capital spending environment for retail technology and a significantly more competitive landscape in the self-checkout business, which negatively impacted sales, gross margins and overall financial results, the Company decided to exit this business and focus on building a payments and services business. 66 OPTIMAL GROUP INC.

Share capital continued On November 7, 2005, the Company announced a stock buyback program which authorizes the Company to purchase up to 1,100,000 or approximately 47% of its issued and outstanding ClassAshares. The shares may be purchased through the facilities of the Nasdaq National Market over the course of 12 months commencing November 21, 2005. All shares purchased under the program will be cancelled. During 2005, 51,800 Class A shares were repurchased. The purchase of 21,800 such shares, having a book value of $183, was settled in 2005 for a total consideration of $436 and such shares were cancelled. The excess of the purchase price over book value of the shares in the amount of $253 was charged to the deficit. The remaining 30,000 Class A shares were settled and cancelled in January 2006 for a total cash consideration of $604. 15. Stock options and warrants a Accelerated vesting of stock options and restricted share units On November 7, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved the accelerated vesting, of all unvested stock options previously awarded to employees, officers and directors. As a result of the accelerated vesting, and the concurrent accelerated vesting of unvested FireOne restricted share units, the Company recorded additional stock-based compensation of approximately $14,100, which is included in the total stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2005 of $22,403 described in note 19 b. The primary purpose of the acceleration was the elimination of stock-based compensation expense in the same aggregate amount that would otherwise be required to be recognized over the period ending June 30, 2007.
In order to prevent unintended personal benefits to employees, officers and directors, the Board imposed restrictions on any shares received through the exercise of accelerated options held by those individuals. These restrictions prevent the sale of any stock obtained through exercise of an accelerated option prior to the earlier of the original vesting date or the individual termination of employment. The Board of Directors of FireOne imposed a similar restriction upon the sale of the ordinary shares underlying the FireOne restricted share units in respect of which the vesting was accelerated. b Optimal Group Inc. The Company has a stock option plan that provides for the granting of options to employees and directors for the purchase of the Companys Class A shares to be issued from treasury. Options may be granted by the Board of Directors for terms of up to ten years. The Board of Directors establishes the exercise period, vesting terms and other conditions for each grant at the grant date. Options may be granted with exercise prices at the then current market price. Options currently outstanding under the plan expire five years after the date of grant and are fully vested as at December31, 2005 as a result of the accelerated vesting of all outstanding options discussed in note 15 a. 76 OPTIMAL GROUP INC.

The plan is administered by FireOnes remuneration committee. Awards are made to eligible individuals at the discretion of the remuneration committee, vest in accordance with a specified vesting schedule and terminate 7years from date of award.
In May 2005, FireOne made an initial award of 2,443,750 restricted share units to employees, officers and directors of FireOne and the Company. In November 2005, an additional 56,248 restricted share units were awarded to certain directors. As at December31, 2005, all restricted share units are fully vested refer to note 15 a.

Commitments and contingencies a Operating leases The Company has entered into operating leases for its premises, vehicles and certain office equipment. Minimum lease payments, including the Company proportionate share of common operating costs, are approximately as follows 2006 3,023 2007 2,619 2008 2,365 2009 1,915 2010 1,421 Thereafter 116 11,459 b The Company received a legal letter from a claimant in 1999, and again in February2001, alleging infringement of a patent related to the U-Scan self-checkout business, which the Company sold to Fujitsu on April 8, 2004. In March 2003, this claimant also sent a third demand letter alleging infringement of additional patents. The Company believes these claims to be without merit and intends to vigorously defend its position should this claimant initiate a civil action. No amounts have been specified in these claims. It is not possible at this time to make an estimate of the amount of damages, if any, that may result and, accordingly, no provision has been made in these financial statements with respect to such claims. c On March 11, 2005, and again on March 31, 2005, the Company received a letter from Fujitsu claiming recovery of expenses allegedly incurred and forecast by Fujitsu to be incurred in relation to the operation of the Companys former U-Scan self-checkout business. In December 2005, the Company was notified by Fujitsu of its intention to arbitrate its claims. In February 2006, the Company received a draft request for arbitration, detailing the claims by Fujitsu. Management is reviewing the claims with counsel and have not yet formed an opinion as to their merit or materiality. Management is unable to determine the resolution of this matter or estimate the ultimate liability, if any, related thereto. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these financial statements with respect to such claims. d The Company is pursuing the recovery of $6,800 withdrawn from a Terra bank account by one of its credit card suppliers for various service charges assessed pertaining to periods prior to December 31, 2001. The Company believes these charges are largely unsubstantiated and is pursuing the claim through legal recourse. The amount, if any, which the Company may recover cannot be quantified until the legal process is complete. 81 OPTIMAL GROUP INC.

Commitments and contingencies continued e The Company is party to litigations arising in the normal course of operations. The Company does not expect the resolution of such matters to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the consolidated operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. f In the sale or other disposition of assets out of the ordinary course of business, in addition to possible indemnification relating to failure to perform covenants and breach of representations and warranties, the Company might agree to indemnify the purchaser against claims from its past conduct of its business. Typically, the term and amount of such indemnification will be limited by agreement. The nature of these indemnification agreements prevents the Company from estimating the maximum potential liability to indemnified parties. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these financial statements with respect to this item. 17. Guarantees As at December 31, 2005, significant guarantees that have been provided to third parties are the following a The Company, and some of its subsidiaries, have granted irrevocable surety bonds and letters of guarantee, issued by highly rated financial institutions to third parties to indemnify them in the event the Company does not perform its contractual obligations. As at December 31, 2005, the maximum potential liability under these guarantees was $300 for surety bonds and $516 CA$600 under letters of guarantee. The surety bonds are automatically renewed on an annual basis. As at December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded no liability with respect to these guarantees, as the Company does not expect to make any payments for the aforementioned items. Management believes that the fair value of the non-contingent obligations to stand ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur approximates the cost of obtaining the surety bonds and letters of guarantee. b The Company entered into an agreement to indemnify FireOne for the payment of certain tax liabilities of FireOne and its subsidiaries, if any, resulting from the reorganization referred to in note 4. 18.

Other charges a Restructuring costs and inventory write-downs During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company incurred charges of $3,299, representing the cost of financial obligations pursuant to an employment contract with a former senior executive. As at December31, 2005, an accrual for this cost is included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities. In addition, $266 for severance costs was incurred to reorganize the service segment to improve efficiencies. All these costs are fully paid.
During 2004, restructuring costs of $923 were recorded as a result of efficiency initiatives undertaken that related to the services operating segment. The restructuring costs related primarily to workforce reduction. In addition, $399 of facility closure costs were incurred relating to the discontinued U.S. operations of Systech. As at December31, 2004, $800 for workforce reduction costs was included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. All of these costs were fully paid in fiscal 2005.
Inventory write-downs of $2,931 were recorded during fiscal 2004 for service parts inventory that were deemed to be no longer of use to the Company in light of the realignment of its services business. 
In 2003, the Company reduced its workforce in an effort to increase operating efficiencies; decrease overall general and administrative expenses and improve financial results. In total, the Company incurred charges of $748 primarily for severance and accrued vacations, of which $639 related to the discontinued operations of the U-Scan self-checkout business. All of these costs are fully paid. b Stock-based compensation Stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations was comprised of 2005 2004 Expense related to options granted in 2004 14,516 4,868 Expense related to FireOne restricted share unit plan 6,080 Amortization of deferred compensation note 5 e 1,807 868 22,403 5,736 The fair value of stock options granted was determined at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions Expected volatility 694 Expected life in years 5 Risk-free interest rate 34 Expected dividend rate 0 The weighted average fair value of 4,636,926 stock options granted in fiscal 2004 was $425 per option. 83 OPTIMAL GROUP INC.

Because these financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, this foreign exchange gain does not impact earnings before income taxes, even though the income tax provision includes a tax liability for this gain. Future fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate between the Canadian and U.S. dollar will change the amount of the foreign exchange gains and, thus, the provision for income taxes thereon. The provision for recovery of income taxes of continuing operations is composed of the following 2005 2004 2003 Current income taxes 8,323 205 961 Future income taxes 2,685 983 2,254 11,008 1,188 3,215 84 OPTIMAL GROUP INC.

The transactions have been recorded at the exchange amount, which is the amount of consideration agreed to by the parties. 23. Financial instruments a Credit risk Credit risk results from the possibility that a loss may occur from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of the contract. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, short-term investments and accounts receivable. Cash is maintained with high-credit, quality financial institutions. Short-term investments consist of discounted notes issued by high-credit, quality corporations. For accounts receivable, management performs periodic credit evaluations. Allowances are maintained for credit losses consistent with the credit risk, historical trends, general economic conditions and other information.
Customers of the payments business consist of a diverse portfolio of small merchants whose businesses frequently are newly established. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company provided services to small business merchants located across the world in a variety of industries. A significant portion of the merchants transaction volume comes from card-not-present transactions, which is subject to a higher risk of merchant losses. Management believes that the loss of any single merchant would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 90 OPTIMAL GROUP INC.

These estimates are subjective in nature and often cannot be determined with precision. 
The Company has determined that the carrying values of its short-term financial assets and liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values due to the relatively short periods to maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of short-term investments as at December 31, 2005 amounted to approximately $85,368 2004 - $90,382 which was calculated by reference to various market data. The carrying values of obligations under capital leases were not significantly different from their fair values. 91 OPTIMAL GROUP INC.

Canadian/U.S. reporting differences continued a Consolidated Statements of Operations continued The weighted average number of Class A shares outstanding for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings loss per share are the same amounts as those disclosed for Canadian GAAP purposes. i Stock-based compensation Prior to January 1, 2003, the Company accounted for its stock-based compensation plan under the recognition and measurement provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations, which requires compensation costs to be recognized for the difference, if any, between the quoted market price of the stock as at the grant date and the amount the individual must pay to acquire the stock. Prior to the cancellation of the outstanding stock options in July 2003, certain of the Companys stock options were variable because the exercise price was not known until the options were exercised. 
Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement 123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation, prospectively for all employee awards granted, modified or settled after January 1, 2003. Consequently, for periods after January1, 2003, there are no differences between Canadian GAAP and U.S. GAAP. However, for awards granted prior to January1, 2003, and because awards under the Companys plan vest over a period of three years, the cost related to stock-based compensation included in the determination of net earnings is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of Statement 123. 
The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings loss and earnings loss per share if the fair value based method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period 2005 2004 2003 Reported net earnings loss 577 9,253 6,168 Deduct: total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of related taxes of nil 10,135 Pro forma net earnings loss 577 9,253 16,303 Earnings loss per share Basic As reported 003 046 041 Pro forma 003 046 109 Diluted As reported 002 046 041 Pro forma 002 046 109 94 OPTIMAL GROUP INC.

In 1996, a total of 285,600 warrants were granted to non-employees, the fair value of which was $834 and was charged to deficit. 2 Change in reporting currency In 1998, the Company adopted the U.S. dollar as its reporting currency. Under Canadian GAAP, at the time of change in reporting currency, the historical financial statements were presented using a translation of convenience. Under U.S. GAAP, the financial statements, including prior years, are translated according to the current rate method. Accordingly, the cumulative translation account included as part of shareholders' equity under Canadian GAAP does not exist for U.S. GAAP purposes. c Accumulated other comprehensive income loss Under U.S. GAAP, SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income establishes standards for reporting and presentation of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of financial statements. Comprehensive income consists of net earnings loss and all other changes in shareholders' equity that do not result from transactions with shareholders. These changes include cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments. The statement requires only additional disclosures in the consolidated financial statements; it does not affect the Company financial position or results of operations.
Accumulated other comprehensive income loss, which resulted solely from the translation of the financial statements up to June30, 2000, the date the Company adopted the United States dollar as its measurement currency, in accordance with the current rate method, is $3,018 as at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. 96 OPTIMAL GROUP INC.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15e promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal accounting officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15f. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005. No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. 98 PART III
