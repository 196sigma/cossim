Penn National Gaming,Inc. and subsidiaries
Wyomissing, Pennsylvania 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Penn National Gaming,Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2002 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2003. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Penn National Gaming,Inc. and
subsidiaries at December31, 2002 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2003 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
As
discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the consolidated financial statements, in January1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. s/BDO SEIDMAN, LLP BDO Seidman, LLP Philadelphia,

Penn National Gaming,Inc. and Subsidiaries      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Business 
Penn National Gaming,Inc. Penn and subsidiaries collectively, the Company is a diversified, multi-jurisdictional owner and operator of gaming and
pari-mutuel properties. Penn is the successor to several businesses that have operated as Penn National Race Course since 1972. Penn was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1982 as PNRC Corp.
and adopted its current name in 1994. In 1997, the Company began its transition from a pari-mutuel company to a diversified gaming company with the acquisition of the Charles Town property
and the introduction of video lottery terminals in West Virginia. From 2000 to 2002, the Company acquired five other gaming properties through its Mississippi Casino Magic-Bay St. Louis
and Boomtown Biloxi, CRC Holdings,Inc. Casino Rouge and Casino Rama management contract, and Bullwhackers properties acquisitions. The transition continued with the acquisition of Hollywood
Casino Corporation on March3, 2003. 
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Penn and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company owns and operates, through its subsidiaries, eight gaming properties in
Charles Town, West Virginia; Bay St. Louis, Biloxi and Tunica, Mississippi; Baton Rouge and Shreveport, Louisiana; Black Hawk, Colorado; and Aurora, Illinois. The Company also owns Penn National Race
Course, a thoroughbred racetrack in Grantville, Pennsylvania, Pocono Downs, a harness racetrack in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and eleven off-track wagering OTW facilities located
throughout Pennsylvania. The Company has a 50% interest in Pennwood Racing,Inc., which owns and operates Freehold Raceway in New Jersey. In addition, the Company has a management contract and
receives a management service fee for operating a gaming facility in Orillia, Ontario, Canada Casino Rama. Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Penn and its subsidiaries. Investment in and advances to an unconsolidated affiliate that is 50%
owned is accounted for under the equity method. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses for
the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers all cash balances and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
Concentration of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The
Company policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution and place investments with financial institutions evaluated as being creditworthy, or in
short-term money 
44  market
and tax-free bond funds which are exposed to minimal interest rate and credit risk. The Company has bank deposits and overnight repurchase agreements that exceed federally insured
limits. Concentration
of credit risk, with respect to casino receivables, is limited through the Company credit evaluation process. The Company issues markers to approved casino customers only
following background checks and investigations of creditworthiness. 
The
Company trade receivables consist principally of amounts due from other racetracks and their OTWs for the settlement of simulcast fees, amounts due from the West Virginia Lottery
for gaming revenue settlements and $121million due from Casino Rama for management service fees of $13million and reimbursement of $108million of expenses to be paid on
behalf of Casino Rama as of December31, 2003. The payable on behalf of Casino Rama is included in accrued salaries in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2003. 
Accounts
are written off when management determines that an account is uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An estimated allowance for
doubtful accounts is determined to reduce the Company receivables to their carrying value, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on historical collection experience,
specific review of individual customer accounts, and current economic and business conditions. Historically, the Company has not incurred any significant credit-related losses. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practical to estimate: Cash
and Cash Equivalents: The carrying amount approximates the fair value due to the short maturity of the cash equivalents. 
Long-term
Debt: The fair value of the Company long-term debt approximates carrying value and is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or
on the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities. Property, Equipment and Management Contract 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs that do not add materially to the value of the asset nor appreciably prolong its useful life
are charged to expense as incurred. Gains or losses on the disposal of property and equipment are included in the determination of income. 
Depreciation
of property and equipment and amortization of leasehold improvements are provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Land improvements
5 to 15 years Building and improvements
25 to 40 years Furniture, fixtures, and equipment
3 to 7 years Transportation equipment
5 years Leasehold Improvements
10 to 20 years Amortization
of the management contract for Casino Rama is computed by the straight-line method through July2011, the expiration date of the agreement. 
45  The
Company reviews the carrying values of its long-lived and identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill, for possible impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated future operating cash flows. As of December31, 2003, the Company has
determined that no impairment has occurred. 
Excess of Cost Over Fair Market Value of Net Assets Acquired Goodwill 
In 2002, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
SFAS142. SFAS142 establishes standards for the accounting of intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets and the accounting for goodwill and
other intangible assets after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements. Under SFAS No142, amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life
is discontinued and additional financial statement disclosure for goodwill and other intangibles is required. Goodwill and intangible assets are tested at least annually for impairment by comparing
the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. 
Because
the Company goodwill is no longer being amortized, the reported amounts of goodwill will not decrease in the same manner as under previous accounting pronouncements. There may
be more volatility in reported income than under previous accounting pronouncements because impairment losses, if any, are likely to occur irregularly and in varying amounts. For the years ended
December31, 2002 and 2003, no impairment charges were required as a result of the impairment test. 
Deferred Financing Costs 
Deferred financing costs that are incurred by the Company in connection with the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the life of
the underlying indebtedness using the interest method adjusted to reflect any early repayments. Income Taxes 
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company financial
statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets
and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. 
Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
Effective January1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities SFAS133, which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. 
The
Company uses fixed and variable rate-debt to finance its operations. Variable rate debt obligations expose the Company to variability in interest payments due to changes
in interest rates. The Company continuously monitors changes in interest rate exposures and evaluates hedging opportunities. The Company risk management policy permits the Company to use any
combination of interest rate swaps, futures, options, caps and similar instruments. 
46  The
Company objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. The Company currently achieves this by entering into interest rate swap agreements to
convert a percentage of its debt from variable to fixed rates. Under interest rate swap contracts, the Company agrees to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional
principal amount, and to receive in return an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times a notional amount. Net settlements are made quarterly. If the contracts are terminated prior
to maturity, the amount paid or received in settlement is established by agreement at the time of the termination and usually represents the net present value, at current rates of interest, of the
remaining obligations to exchange payments under the terms of the contract. The Company accounts for these swaps as cash flow hedges. Generally, the Company does not issue or hold derivative contracts
for speculative purposes. 
The
Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to these interest rate swap agreements, but it does not expect any of the
counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. To manage credit risks, the Company selects counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single counterparty under defined Company
guidelines, and monitors the market position with each counterparty. 
The
fair value of derivatives is included in the balance sheets as an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and that is designated and
qualifies as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged
transaction e.g., until periodic settlements of a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness which represents the amount by which the changes
in the fair value of the derivative
exceed the variability in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction is recorded in current-period earnings. The
Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various
hedge transactions. The Company also formally assesses both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective
in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in the future periods. When it is determined that a derivative is not
or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively, as discussed below. The
Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when 1it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item
including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions, such as future variable rate interest payments; 2the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised;
3it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or 4management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. 
When
the Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period, the gain or loss on the
derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. However, if it is probable that a forecasted
transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were accumulated in
other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in earnings. In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will carry the
derivative at its fair value on the balance 
47  sheet,
recognizing changes in the fair value in current-period earnings. For purposes of the cash flows statement, cash flows from derivative instruments designated and qualifying as hedges are
classified with the cash flows from the hedged item. Cash flows from derivatives held for speculative purposes are classified as investing cash flows. 
Revenue Recognition 
In accordance with gaming industry practice, the Company recognizes casino revenues as the net of gaming wins less losses. Net revenues exclude the retail value
of complimentary rooms, food and
beverage furnished gratuitously to customers. These amounts that are included in promotional allowances were as follows: Year ended December 31,

revenues include the Company share of pari-mutuel wagering on live races after payment of amounts returned as winning wagers, and the Company share of wagering
from import and export simulcasting, as well as its share of wagering from its OTWs. 
Revenues
from the Management Contract for Casino Rama see Note2 are based upon contracted terms and are recognized when services are performed. Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings per share EPS are computed by dividing net income applicable to common stock by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted EPS reflects the additional dilution for all potentially dilutive securities such as stock options. 
Options
to purchase 156,000, 337,500, and 130,000 shares of common stock were outstanding during the years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively, but were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options' exercise prices were greater than the 
48  average
market price of the common shares and, therefore the effect would be antidilutive. The following represents reconciliation from basic earnings per share to diluted earnings per share. Year ended December 31,

40,612 Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. The
Company accounts for stock option grants using the intrinsic-value method in accordance with APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and related
Interpretations. Under the intrinsic-value method, because the exercise price of the Company employee stock options is less than or equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of
grant, no compensation expense is recognized. 
The
Company accounts for the plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB25 and related Interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected
in net income for options granted since all options granted under the plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. However, there are
situations that may occur, such as the accelerated vesting of options, that require a current charge to income. 
The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS123, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No148, Accounting for Stock-Based

Certain Risks and Uncertainties 
The Company operations are dependent on its continued licensing by state gaming commissions. The loss of a license, in any jurisdiction in which the Company
operates, could have a material, adverse effect on future results of operations. The
Company is dependent on each gaming property local market for a significant number of its patrons and revenues. If economic conditions in these areas deteriorate or additional
gaming licenses are awarded in these markets, the Company results of operations could be adversely affected. 
The
Company is also dependent upon a stable gaming and admission tax structure in the states that it operates in. Any change in the tax structure could have a material adverse affect on
future results of operations. 
Reclassification 
Certain prior years amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2003 
In January 2003, FASB issued Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities Interpretation No46, clarifies the
application of Accounting Research Bulletin No51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial
interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. Interpretation No46 is
applicable immediately for variable interest entities created after January31, 2003. For variable interest entities created prior to February1, 2003, the provisions of Interpretation
No46 are applicable at the end of the annual reporting period ending after December15, 2003. This Interpretation did not have an effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
In
April 2002, the FASB issued Statement No145, Rescission of FASB Statements No4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No13, and Technical Corrections
SFAS145. The rescission of FASB No4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt applies to us. FASB No4 required that gains and losses from extinguishment
of debt that were included in the determination of net income be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of the related income tax effect. SFAS145 is effective
for our fiscal year beginning January1, 2003. We had losses on early extinguishment of debt, net of income taxes of $52million for the year ended December31, 2002, 
50  respectively.
These losses reflect the write-off of deferred finance fees and pre-payment fees associated with bank debt that was repaid with the proceeds of new financing.
Effective January1, 2003, pursuant to SFAS145, the losses on early extinguishment of debt will be included in Other income expense in our consolidated statements of income. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
There are no accounting standards issued before December31, 2003 but effective after December31, 2003 which are expected to have a material impact
on our financial reporting.

December31, 2003, the Company was contingently obligated under letters of credit issued pursuant to the senior secured credit facility with face amounts aggregating
$82million. 
54  Senior Secured Credit Facility 
On March3, 2003, the Company entered into an $800million senior secured credit facility with a syndicate of lenders that replaced its
$350million credit facility. 
The
credit facility was initially comprised of a $100million revolving credit facility maturing on September1, 2007, a $100million Term A facility loan maturing
on September1, 2007 and a $600million Term B facility loan maturing on September1, 2007. On March3, 2003 the Company borrowed the entire Term A and Term B term loans to
complete the purchase of Hollywood Casino Corporation and to call Hollywood Casino Corporation $360million senior secured notes. On
September30, 2003, the Company made an optional prepayment of $27million toward its $800million senior secured credit facility. Based on the Company
consolidated EBITDA as defined in the credit agreement for the 12months ended September30, 2003, the payment triggered a reduction of the interest rate margin on the Term A portion
of the credit facility by 025% and a reduction of the interest rate margin on the Term B portion of the credit facility by 05%. The reductions of the interest rate margins became effective on
October23, 2003. 
On
December3, 2003, the Company made a pre-payment of $105million plus accrued interest to satisfy in full its Term Loan A Facility due March2008.
Additionally, the Company made a pre-payment of $1951million plus accrued interest against our Term Loan B Facility due March2009, which had approximately
$5963million outstanding at September30, 2003. The pre-payments were funded with the net proceeds of the $200million 67/8% senior
subordinated note offering and with cash from operations. Following the payments, the Term Loan B Facility had approximately $3997million outstanding. 
On
December5, 2003, the $800million senior credit facility was amended and restated. The amended agreement reduced the total credit facility from $800million to
$500million and converted the Term Loan B facility to a Term Loan D facility due September2007. The Term Loan D facility will initially accrue interest at 250 basis points over LIBOR,
representing a 100 basis point reduction from the original terms of the Term Loan B facility. In addition, the Term Loan D facility allows the Company to raise an additional $225million in
senior secured credit to expand its Pennsylvania racetrack operations if legislation is passed permitting slot machines or video lottery terminals at these facilities. The Term Loan B facility had
allowed the Company to raise an additional $100million in senior secured credit to expand its Pennsylvania racetrack operations if legislation is passed permitting slot machines or video
lottery terminals at these facilities. 
At
December31, 2003, the Company had an outstanding balance of $3997million on Term LoanD facility and $918million available to borrow under the
revolving credit facility after giving effect to outstanding letters of credit of $82million. The weighted average interest rate on the Term D facility is 363% at year-end
excluding swaps and deferred finance fees. 
The
senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company, except for the assets of Hollywood Casino Shreveport, which serve as collateral for the
notes of Hollywood Casino Shreveport. See Hollywood Casino Shreveport Notes below. Interest Rate Swap Contracts 
The Company has a policy designed to manage interest rate risk associated with its current and anticipated future borrowings. This policy enables the Company to
use any combination of interest rate swaps, futures, options, caps and similar instruments. To the extent the Company employs such financial instruments pursuant to this policy, they are generally
accounted for as hedging instruments. In order 
55  to
qualify for hedge accounting, the underlying hedged item must expose the Company to risks associated with market fluctuations and the financial instrument used must be designated as a hedge and
must reduce the Company exposure to market fluctuations throughout the hedge period. If these criteria are not met, a change in the market value of the financial instrument is recognized as a gain
or loss in the period of change. Net settlements pursuant to the financial instrument are included as interest expense in the period. 
On
December20, 2000, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $100million and a termination date of December22, 2003. Under this
agreement, the Company pays a fixed rate of 5835% against a variable interest rate based on the 90-day LIBOR rate. On August3, 2001, the Company entered into an interest rate swap
with a notional amount of $36million with a termination date of June30, 2004. Under this agreement, the Company pays a fixed rate of 48125% against a variable interest rate based on
the 90-day LIBOR rate. The Company entered into these interest rates swap agreements due to the requirements of the then current senior secured credit facility and to reduce the impact of
future variable interest payments related to the such senior secured credit facility. 
In
2001, the Company accounted for the effective interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges. The changes in the fair values of effective interest rate swaps were recorded as
adjustments to accrued interest in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The amount of ineffectiveness related to the cash flow
hedges in 2001 and 2002 was immaterial. In March2002, the Company repaid all of its then outstanding variable rate debt with the issuance of the 87/8% Senior Subordinated Notes,
fixed rate debt. The hedge designation was removed. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts are recognized as adjustments to loss on change in fair values of interest
rate swaps in the accompanying statements of income in the period in which they occur. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a non-cash pre-tax loss of $58million, or
$09 per diluted share after tax, for the year ended December31, 2002 and $5million, or $01 per diluted share after tax, for the year ended December31, 2003. Amounts
previously recognized in other comprehensive income will be reclassified to income over the remaining term of the swap as the Company incurs interest expense on the replacement debt. Over the next
twelve months, approximately $125,000 will be reclassified to income. 
On
March27, 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $3750million in accordance with the terms of the
$800million senior secured credit facility. There are three two-year swap contracts totaling $175million with an effective date of March27, 2003 and a termination
date of March27, 2005. Under these contracts, the Company pays a fixed rate of 192% and receive a variable rate based on the 90-day LIBOR rate. The Company also entered into three
three-year swap contracts totaling $200million with a termination date of March27, 2006. The Company accounted for these effective interest rate swap agreements as cash
flow hedges. The changes in the fair values of effective interest rate swaps were recorded as adjustments to accrued interest in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet with the offset recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive loss. The amount of ineffectiveness related to the cash flow hedges in 2003, was immaterial. Under these contracts, the Company pays fixed rates of 248% to 249%
against a variable rate based on the 90-day LIBOR rate. The difference between amounts received and amounts paid under such agreements, as well as any costs or fees, is recorded as a
reduction of, or addition to, interest expense as incurred over the life of the swap. At
December31, 2003, the 90-day LIBOR rate was 115%. 
56  Termination of Interest Rate Swap Agreement 
Effective March3, 2003, the Company terminated its $36million notional amount interest rate swap originally scheduled to expire in
June2004. The Company paid $19million to terminate the swap agreement. 
111/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008  On March12, 2001, the Company completed an offering of $200million of its 111/8% Senior subordinated notes that mature on
March1, 2008. Interest on the notes is payable on March1 and September1 of each year, beginning September1, 2001. The proceeds from these notes were used, in part, to
finance the CRC Acquisition. 
The
Company may redeem all or part of the notes on or after March1, 2005 at certain specified redemption prices. Prior to March1, 2004, the Company may redeem up to 35%
of the notes from proceeds of certain sales of its equity securities. The notes are also subject to redemption requirements imposed by state and local gaming laws and regulations. The
notes are general unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by all of the Company current and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. The notes
rank equally with the Company future senior subordinated debt and junior to its senior debt, including debt under the Company senior credit facility. In addition, the notes will be effectively
junior to any indebtedness of Penn non-U.S. subsidiaries or subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes Unrestricted Subsidiaries. 
The
111/8% notes and guarantees were originally issued in a private placement pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended the Securities Act. On July30, 2001, the Company completed an offer to exchange the notes and guarantees for notes and guarantees registered under the Securities Act having
substantially identical terms. 
87/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2010 
On February28, 2002, the Company completed an offering of $175million of its 87/8% senior subordinated notes that mature on
March15, 2010. Interest on the 87/8% notes is payable on March15 and September15 of each year, beginning September15, 2002. The Company used the net
proceeds from the offering, totaling approximately $1700million after deducting underwriting discounts and related expenses, to repay term loan indebtedness under its existing senior secured
credit facility. 
The
Company may redeem all or part of the 87/8% notes on or after March15, 2006 at certain specified redemption prices. Prior to March15, 2005, the Company
may redeem up to 35% of the 87/8% notes from proceeds of certain sales of its equity securities. The 87/8% notes also are subject to redemption requirements imposed by
state and local gaming laws and regulations. 
The
87/8% notes are general unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by certain of the Company current and future wholly-owned domestic
subsidiaries. The 87/8% notes rank equally with the Company future senior subordinated debt and the 111/8% senior subordinated notes, and junior to its senior debt,
including debt under the Company senior credit facility. In addition, the 87/8% notes will be effectively junior to any indebtedness of Penn non-U.S. subsidiaries or
Unrestricted Subsidiaries, none of which have guaranteed the 87/8% notes. 
57  67/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 
On December1, 2003, the Company completed an offering of $200million of its 67/8% senior subordinated notes that mature on
December1, 2011. Interest on the notes is payable on June1 and December1 of each year, beginning June1, 2004. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering,
totaling approximately $1966million after deducting underwriting discounts and related expenses, to repay term loan indebtedness under its existing senior secured credit facility. 
The
Company may redeem all or part of the notes on or after December1, 2007 at certain specified redemption prices. Prior to December1, 2006, the Company may redeem up to
35% of the notes from proceeds of certain sales of its equity securities. The notes are also subject to redemption requirements imposed by state and local gaming laws and regulations. 
The
67/8% notes are general unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by all of the Company current and future wholly-owned domestic
subsidiaries. The 67/8% notes rank equally with the Company future senior subordinated debt and junior to its senior debt, including debt under the Company senior credit facility.
In addition, the 67/8% notes will be effectively junior to any indebtedness of Penn non-U.S. Unrestricted Subsidiaries. 
The
67/8% notes and guarantees were originally issued in a private placement pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. 
Covenants 
The terms of the Company senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated notes require the Company to satisfy certain financial covenants, including, but
not limited to, leverage and fixed charges coverage ratios and limitations on indebtedness, liens, investments and capital expenditures. At December31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with
all required financial covenants. 
Hollywood Casino Shreveport Notes 
Hollywood Casino Shreveport and Shreveport Capital Corporation are co-issuers of $150million aggregate principal amount of 13% senior secured
notes due 2006 and $39million aggregate principal amount of 13% first mortgage notes due 2006 the Hollywood Casino Shreveport Notes. Hollywood Casino Shreveport is a general partnership
that owns the casino operations. Shreveport Capital Corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hollywood Casino Shreveport formed solely for the purpose of being a co-issuer of the
Hollywood Casino Shreveport Notes. 
The
Hollywood Casino Shreveport Notes are non-recourse to Penn and its subsidiaries other than Hollywood Casino Shreveport, Shreveport Capital Corporation,
HCSI,Inc., HCS II,Inc. and HWCC-Louisiana,Inc. collectively the Shreveport Entities and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the casino,
and the partnership interests held by HCSI,Inc. and HCSII,Inc. and the stock held by HWCC-Louisiana,Inc. The
indentures governing the Hollywood Casino Shreveport Notes require the issuers to make an offer to purchase the Hollywood Casino Shreveport Notes at 101% of the principal amount
thereof within 10days of the occurrence of a Change of Control as defined in the indentures. A Change of Control was deemed to have occurred under the indentures on March3, 2003 as
a result of the consummation of the merger of our wholly-owned subsidiary with and into Hollywood Casino Corporation. Hollywood Casino Shreveport determined that it did not have the liquidity to
repurchase the Hollywood Casino Shreveport Notes at 101% of their principal amount. 
58  On
March14, 2003, the Hollywood Casino Shreveport and Shreveport Capital Corporation were notified by an ad hoc committee of holders of the Hollywood Casino Shreveport Notes that
they have 60days from receipt of the notice to cure the failure to offer to purchase the Hollywood Casino Shreveport Notes or an event of default will have occurred under the indentures.
Neither Hollywood Casino Shreveport nor Shreveport Capital Corporation made a Change of Control offer to purchase the Hollywood Casino Shreveport Notes within the sixty days. Hollywood Casino
Shreveport did not make the August1, 2003 interest payment of $123million due on the Hollywood Casino Shreveport Notes. There can be no assurance that the holders of the Hollywood
Casino Shreveport Notes will not pursue all rights and remedies that they may have under the indentures as a result. Further, any action on the part of the note holders may require the Shreveport
Entities to seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws or other similar remedies. See Note15 for subsequent events. 
6.Commitments and Contingencies  Litigation 
Penn and its subsidiaries are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings relating to personal injuries, employment matters, commercial transactions
and other matters arising in the normal course of business. The Company does not believe that the final outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company consolidated
financial position or results of operations. In addition, the Company maintains what it believes is adequate insurance coverage to further mitigate the risks of such proceedings. However, such
proceedings can be costly, time consuming and unpredictable and, therefore, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of such proceedings may not materially impact the Company consolidated
financial condition or results of operations. Further, no assurance can be given that the amount or scope of existing insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover losses arising from such matters. 
The
following proceedings could result in costs, settlements or damages that materially impact the Company consolidated financial condition or operating results. In each instance, the
Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and/or counter-claims and intends to vigorously defend itself. 
In
August2002, the lessor of the property on which Casino Rouge conducts a significant portion of its dockside operations filed a lawsuit against the Company in the
19th Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana seeking a declaratory judgment that the plaintiff is entitled to terminate the lease and/or void the Company
option to renew the lease due to certain alleged defaults by the Company or its predecessors-in-interest. The term of the Company lease expired in January2004 and the
Company exercised its automatic right to renew for an additional five year term which, as previously noted is being contested by the landlord. In September2003 the court granted the Company
a partial motion for summary judgment. A hearing date has not yet been set. Further litigation on the remaining issues is anticipated. See Note 15 for subsequent events. 
In
October 2002, in response to the Company plans to relocate the river barge underlying the Boomtown Biloxi casino to an adjacent property, the lessor of the property on which the
Boomtown Biloxi casino conducts a portion of its dockside operations, filed a lawsuit against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi seeking a declaratory
judgment that ithe Company must use the leased premises for a gaming use or, in the alternative, iiafter the move, the Company will remain obligated to make the revenue based rent
payments to plaintiff set forth in the lease. The plaintiff filed this suit immediately after the Mississippi Gaming Commission approved the Company request to relocate the barge. Since such
approval, the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have also approved our plan to relocate the barge. 
59  The
Company filed a motion for summary judgment in October2003 and the plaintiff filed its own motion for summary judgment in January2004. Discovery is substantially complete at this
time and a trial date has been set for April2004. 
In
October 2003, the Company and one of its subsidiaries brought a declaratory action for coverage against Lexington Insurance Company and National Union Fire Insurance of Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania National Union in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, West Virginia the West Virginia Action. The case involves a dispute over coverage for punitive damage awards for claims
arising in West Virginia. Subsequent to the filing of the West Virginia action, National Union brought an action against the Company and several of its subsidiaries in the Court of Common Pleas of
Berks County, Pennsylvania denying coverage for punitive damage awards for claims arising in West Virginia. The Company is currently a defendant in several cases in West Virginia in which punitive
damages have been plead. See Note15 for subsequent events. 
Operating Leases 
The Company is liable under numerous operating leases for automobiles, other equipment and buildings, which expire through 2010. Total rental expense under these
agreements was $40million, $52million, and $66million for the years ended December31, 2001, 2002, and 2003, respectively. The
future lease commitments relating to noncancelable operating leases as of December31, 2003 are as follows in thousands: Year ending December 31 2004 4,464 2005 3,057 2006 2,346 2007 1,714 2008 1,501 Thereafter 7,908 20,990 The
Company leases land for use by Boomtown Biloxi. The lease term is 99years and is cancelable upon one year notice. The lease called for an initial deposit by the Company of
$20million and for annual base lease rent payments of $20million and percentage rent equal to 50% of adjusted gaming win as defined in the lease over $250million and 60%
of the amount by which the adjusted gaming win exceeds $500million. For the years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 the Company paid lease rent under this agreement of
$36million, $42million, and $43million respectively. The
Company leases land for use by Bullwhackers Casinos in Black Hawk, Colorado. There are four leases with terms of one to 20years. The leases consist of annual base lease rent
payments, which are included in the above table, plus a percentage rent based on a percent of adjusted gaming win as described in the leases. The annual base lease rent payments were

matching Company contributions that vest over a five-year period. The Company has established a Trust and transfers to the Trust, on an annual basis, an amount necessary to provide on a
present value basis for its respective future liabilities with respect to participant deferral and Company contribution amounts. Company contributions in 2001, 2002 and 2003 were $5million 3million and $6million, respectively.

determined to be an Adverse Person. If the Company is involved in certain transactions after the Rights become exercisable, a Holder of Rights other than Rights owned by a shareholder who has
acquired 15% or more of the Company outstanding common stock or is determined to be an Adverse Person, which Rights become void is entitled to buy a number of the acquiring company Common Shares
or the Company common stock, as the case may be, having a market value of twice the exercise price of each Right. A potential dilutive effect may exist upon the exercise of the Rights. Until a Right

until the Distribution Date and will expire at the close of business on March18, 2009, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company.

Section422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and nonqualified stock options, which do not so qualify. At December31, 2003, there were 18,750 options available for
future grants under the 1994 Plan. Unless the Board of Directors terminates the 1994 Plan earlier, the 1994 Plan will terminate in April2004. On

of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and nonqualified stock options, which do not so qualify. The exercise price per share may be no less than i100% of the fair market value of
the Common Stock on the date an option is granted for incentive stock options and ii85% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date an option is granted for nonqualified stock
options. Unless this plan is extended, no awards shall be granted or exchanges effected under this plan after May31, 2013. At December31, 2003, there were 5,545,000 options available
for future grants under the 2003 Plan.

15.Subsequent Events 
Bangor Historic Track 
On January6, 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with Shawn Scott and Capital Seven, LLC to purchase all of the shares of Bangor Historic
Track,Inc. BHT, the company that operates Bangor Raceway in Bangor, Maine. In conjunction with the purchase agreement, the Company also secured an option to purchase the interests in
Vernon Downs, which does business as Mid-State Raceway, a harness racing facility in Vernon, New York, controlled by an affiliate of Capital Seven, LLC. Initially, the purchase agreement
provided that the purchase price includes up front cash, progress and milestone payments and a final payment, subject to adjustment based on the final passage of gaming legislation. The agreement also
provided that the closing was subject to a number of conditions and contingencies, including gaming and other approvals. The citizens of Bangor approved a local referendum authorizing the operation of
slot machines at Bangor Raceway in June2003. On January15, 2004, the Maine Harness Racing Commission MHRC issued an order providing that they would issue a conditional license to
BHT if, among other things, the Company accelerated its purchase of BHT. To do so, the Company amended its purchase agreement to provide for an accelerated closing without the payment of any
additional funds and to provide for the payment of the balance of the purchase price over time if, as and when the various conditions and contingencies specified for such additional payments were
satisfied. In addition, the Company also provided for a put
mechanism allowing it to dispose of its ownership interest under certain circumstances. Upon exercise of the put, the shares would be transferred to a trustee who has been instructed to resell the
shares for the benefit of the seller. In such event, the seller will be entitled to keep any deposits paid or accrued through the date of the put. On February12, 2004, after the completion of
the due diligence process, the Company decided not to exercise our option to purchase the interest in Vernon Downs. At
this stage, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to complete the transaction contemplated by the purchase agreement. In addition, both the regulatory and
legislative environment are currently subject to significant uncertainty. While the voter initiated legislation authorizing the operation of slot machines at commercial tracks became effective in
February2004, the MHRC has not yet commenced the process of adopting rules and regulations necessary to allow for the issuance of gaming related licenses. In addition, the Maine legislature is
currently considering various amendments to the existing legislation that may adversely impact the timing and ability of BHT to conduct gaming operations. Finally, although the MHRC issued an order on
March3, 2004 conditionally granting to BHT a license, subject to certain conditions, to conduct racing operations at Bangor Raceway in 2004, certain special interest groups have commenced
litigation challenging the grant of the racing license to BHT. While the Company intends to defend BHT vigorously, such challenges, if successful, may adversely impact the timing and ability of BHT to
conduct racing or gaming operations at Bangor Raceway. 
Rosemont Proposal 
On January22, 2004, the Company submitted a bid to finance and construct a casino in the greater Chicago area. The Company was one of seven companies
seeking to purchase the bankrupt Emerald Casino,Inc. and one of three companies proposing to construct a casino in Rosemont, Illinois. The Company was not among the three finalists selected by
the Illinois Gaming Board. 
70  Hollywood Casino Shreveport 
On February3, 2004, the Company indirect subsidiary, HCS I,Inc., the managing general partner of Hollywood Casino Shreveport HCS, announced
that its Board of Directors the Board has initiated a process that it hopes will result in the sale or other disposition of the riverboat casino/hotel complex of HCS located in Shreveport,
Louisiana. The announcement followed action by the Board authorizing HCS financial advisor, Libra Securities LLC, to begin contacting potential acquirers. The Board also authorized the creation of
an independent committee to oversee the sale process, consisting of the director who is not employed directly by Penn. The Board created the independent committee in the event that Penn seeks to
participate as a bidder in the sale process. The Board took action after
consultation with an ad hoc committee of holders of the Hollywood Casino Shreveport Notes. Such notes are carried on the balance sheet at $1193million, reflecting the fair value of the assets
acquired at the date of acquisition. Although no formal agreement has been reached with the ad hoc committee regarding the sale process, HCS anticipates that it will consult with the ad hoc committee
throughout the process. There can be no assurance that the process will result in the sale or other disposition of the riverboat casino/hotel complex or that, if it does, the sale proceeds will be
adequate to pay the Hollywood Casino Shreveport Notes in full. HCS currently anticipates that any transaction would be effected through a federal bankruptcy proceeding. The Board also determined not
