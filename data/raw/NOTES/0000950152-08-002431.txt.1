ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Core Molding Technologies, Inc.
Columbus, Ohio We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Core Molding Technologies,
Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December31, 2007. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
listed in the Index at . These financial statements and financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control
over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Core Molding Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries at December
31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated
financial statements, effective January 1, 2006, the Company changed the manner in which
it accounts for share-based compensation; in addition, as discussed in Note 11, the Company changed the manner in which it records the
funded status of its postretirement health and life insurance benefits plans, effective December 31, 2006.

See notes to consolidated financial statements. 29 Table of Contents Core Molding Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Business Formation and Nature of Operations Core Molding Technologies and its subsidiaries operate in the plastics market in a family of
products known as reinforced plastics. Reinforced plastics are combinations of resins and
reinforcing fibers typically glass or carbon that are molded to shape. Core Molding Technologies
operates four production facilities in Columbus, Ohio; Batavia, Ohio; Gaffney, South Carolina; and
Matamoros, Mexico. The Columbus and Gaffney facilities produce reinforced plastics by compression
molding sheet molding compound SMC in a closed mold process. The Batavia facility, which was
acquired in August2005 see Note 4, produces reinforced plastic products by a spray-up open mold
process and resin transfer molding RTM closed mold process utilizing multiple insert tooling
MIT. The Matamoros facility utilizes spray-up and hand lay-up open mold processes and resin
transfer RTM closed molding utilizing the vacuum infusion process to produce reinforced plastic
products. Core Molding Technologies also sells reinforced plastic products in the
automotive-aftermarket industry as a result of its September2004 acquisition of certain assets of
Keystone Restyling Products, Inc. The Company operates in one business segment as a compounder of sheet molding composites
SMC and molder of fiberglass reinforced plastics. The Company produces and sells both SMC
compound and molded products for varied markets, including light, medium, and heavy-duty trucks,
automobiles and automotive aftermarket, personal watercraft, and other commercial products. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles
of Consolidation - The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of all subsidiaries after elimination of all intercompany accounts, transactions, and
profits. Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition - Revenue from product sales is recognized at the time products are
shipped and title transfers. Allowances for returned products, chargebacks and other credits are
estimated and recorded as revenue is recognized. Tooling revenue is recognized when the customer
approves the tool and accepts ownership. Progress billings and expenses are shown net as an asset
or liability on the Companys balance sheet. Tooling in progress can fluctuate significantly from
period to period and is dependent upon the stage of tooling projects and the related billing and
expense payment timetable for individual projects and therefore does not necessarily reflect
projected income or loss from tooling projects. At December31, 2007 the Company has recorded a
net liability related to tooling in progress of $102,000, which represents approximately $4,738,000
of progress tooling billings and $4,636,000 of progress tooling expenses. At December31, 2006
the Company had recorded a net liability related to tooling in progress of $1,180,000, which
represents approximately $15,881,000 of progress tooling billings and $14,701,000 of progress
tooling expenses. Cash
and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with
an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash is held primarily in one
bank. At December31, 2007 the Company had no cash on hand and book overdrafts in the amount of
$2,945,000 which are recorded in accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Accounts
Receivable Allowances - Management maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the
financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of
their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The Company had recorded an
allowance for doubtful accounts of $334,000 at December31, 2007 and $262,000 at December31, 2006.
Management also records estimates for chargebacks such as customer returns, customer rework
chargebacks, discounts offered to customers, and price adjustments. Should these customer returns,
chargebacks, discounts, and price adjustments fluctuate from the estimated amounts, additional
allowances may be required. The Company has reduced accounts receivable for chargebacks of
$1,576,000 at December31, 2007 and $1,426,000 at
December31, 2006. There have been no material changes in the
methodology of these calculations. Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or market. The
Company has recorded an allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory of $294,000 at December
31, 2007 and $341,000 at December31, 2006. 30 Table of Contents Core Molding Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
The carrying amount of long-lived assets is evaluated annually to determine if adjustment to the
depreciation period or to the unamortized balance is warranted. Ranges of estimated useful lives for computing depreciation are as follows   
Land improvements
20years   Building and improvements
20-40years   Machinery and equipment
3-15years   Tools, dies and patterns
3-5years Depreciation expense was $3,302,000, $2,613,000, and $2,158,000 for 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively. In 2007, approximately $18,000 of interest cost was capitalized in property, plant,
and equipment. In 2006 approximately $125,000 of interest cost was capitalized. No interest costs
were capitalized in 2005. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment, goodwill,
and a customer list. The recoverability of long-lived assets is evaluated by an analysis of
operating results and consideration of other significant events or changes in the business
environment. The Company evaluates whether impairment exists for property and equipment and the
customer list on the basis of undiscounted expected future cash flows from operations before
interest. For goodwill, the Company evaluates annually on December31st whether
impairment exists. If impairment exists, the carrying amount of the long-lived assets is reduced
to its estimated fair value, less any costs associated with the final settlement. For the years
ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, there was no impairment of the Companys long-lived
assets. Self-insurance The Company is self-insured with respect to its Columbus and Batavia, Ohio
and Gaffney, South Carolina medical and dental claims and Columbus and Batavia, Ohio workers
compensation claims. The Company has recorded an estimated liability for self-insured medical and
dental claims incurred but not reported and workers compensation claims incurred but not reported
at December31, 2007, and 2006 of $1,141,000 and $1,036,000, respectively. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments consist of long-term
debt, an interest rate swap, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. The carrying amount of
these financial instruments approximated their fair value. Concentration of Credit Risk The Company has significant transactions with two major
customers see Note 3, which together comprised 77%, 72%, and 63% of total sales in 2007, 2006,
and 2005, respectively and 64% and 68% of the accounts receivable balances at December31, 2007 and
2006, respectively. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial
condition. The Company maintains reserves for potential bad debt losses, and such bad debt losses
have been historically within the Companys expectations. Export sales, including sales to Canada
and Mexico, for products provided to certain customers manufacturing and service locations totaled
15%, 20%, and 20% of total sales for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Earnings Per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share
are computed similarly but include the effect of the assumed exercise of dilutive stock options and
restricted stock under the treasury stock method. 31 Table of Contents Core Molding Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued The computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share is as follows

1997 and 1998 and were being amortized over the lease period. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No48 FIN
48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty
in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. FIN 48 also
provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
periods, disclosures, and transition. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December15, 2006, and will become effective for the Company on January1, 2007. For
benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon
examination by taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of
benefit that is greater than 50percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The
impact of the adoption of FIN 48 is discussed in Note 10. In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157 Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No157 does not
require any new fair value measurements, rather it applies under existing accounting pronouncements
that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS No157 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No157
on the consolidated financial statements. In February2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, Establishing the Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Liabilities, to permit all entities to choose to elect to measure eligible
financial instruments at fair value. SFAS No159 applies to fiscal years beginning after November
15, 2007, with early adoption permitted for an entity that has also elected to apply the provisions
of SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements. An entity is prohibited from retrospectively applying
SFAS No159, unless it chooses early adoption. Management is currently evaluating the impact of
SFAS No159 on the consolidated financial statements. In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141R to improve the relevance, representational
faithfulness, and comparability of information that a reporting entity provides in its financial
reports regarding business combinations and its effects, including recognition of assets and
liabilities, the measurement of goodwill and required disclosures. This Statement is effective for 32 Table of Contents Core Molding Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December15,
2008 and earlier adoption is prohibited. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the
provisions of SFAS No141R on the consolidated financial statements. In February2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No.FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB
Statement No157 FSP FAS 157-2. FSP FAS 157-2 defers the effective date provision of SFAS
157. As a result of the issuance of FSP FAS 157-2, the provisions of SFAS 157 are effective for
fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008. Management is currently evaluating the impact of
adopting SFAS 157 on the consolidated financial statements Foreign Currency Adjustments In conjunction with the Companys acquisition of certain assets
of Airshield Corporation, the Company established operations in Mexico. The functional currency
for the Mexican operations is the United States dollar. All foreign currency asset and liability
amounts are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Income
statement accounts are translated at the monthly average rates. Gains and losses resulting from
translation of foreign currency financial statements into United States dollars and gains and
losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in current results of operations.
Aggregate foreign currency translation and transaction gainslosses included in Selling General
and Administration totaled $5,975 in 2007, $17,219 in 2006, and $90,131 in 2005. 3. Major Customers The
Company currently has two major customers, Navistar, Inc.
Navistar formerly known as International Truck Engine Corporation, and PACCAR, Inc.
PACCAR. Major customers are defined as customers whose sales individually consist of more than
ten percent of total sales. The loss of a significant portion of sales to Navistar, or PACCAR
would have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company. In previous years the Company
identified Freightliner, LLC Freightliner as a major customer; however, in 2007 Freightliners
individual sales were less than ten percent of total sales.

4. Acquisitions On August3, 2005 Core Molding Technologies, Inc. acquired certain assets of the Cincinnati
Fiberglass Division of Diversified Glass, Inc., a Batavia, Ohio-based, privately held manufacturer
and distributor of fiberglass reinforced plastic components supplied primarily to the heavy-duty
truck market, for $688,077. The acquisition was part of the Companys growth strategy. Core
Molding Technologies has continued operation of the Batavia facility. As part of the acquisition,
Core Molding Technologies agreed to lease the manufacturing facility from the previous owner of
Diversified Glass, Inc. 33 Table of Contents Core Molding Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued The acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the
operating results of the Batavia facility have been included with those of the Company subsequent
to August3, 2005. The following table presents the allocation of the purchase price

5. Foreign Operations In conjunction with the Companys acquisition of assets of Airshield Corporation on October
16, 2001, the Company established manufacturing operations in Mexico under the Maquiladora
program. The Mexican operation is a captive manufacturing facility of the Company and the
functional currency is United States dollars. Essentially all sales of the Mexican operation are
made to United States customers in United States dollars, which totaled $18,800,000 in 2007 28,737,000 in 2006, and $25,005,000 in 2005. Expenses are incurred in the United States dollar
and the Mexican peso. Expenses incurred in pesos include labor, utilities, supplies and materials,
and amounted to approximately 41% of sales in 2007, 33% of sales in 2006, and 31% of sales in 2005.
The Company owns long-lived assets that are geographically located at the Mexican operation, which
have a net book value of $956,000 at December31, 2007. The Companys manufacturing operation in
Mexico is subject to various political, economic, and other risks and uncertainties inherent to
Mexico. Among other risks, the Companys Mexican operations are subject to domestic and
international customs and tariffs, changing taxation policies, and governmental regulations. 6. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment consist of the following at December31

Note Payable Bank On December30, 2003, the Company borrowed $9,000,000 in the form of a note payable
collateralized by the Companys assets. The note payable bears interest at a variable rate of
LIBOR plus 200 basis points or the prime rate and this rate was 723% at December31, 2007. Industrial Revenue Bond In May1998, the Company borrowed $7,500,000 through the issuance of an Industrial Revenue
Bond IRB. The IRB bears interest at a weekly adjustable rate and matures in April2013. The
maximum interest rate that may be charged at any time over the life of the IRB is 10%. As security for the IRB, the Company obtained a letter of credit from a commercial bank, which
has a balance of $3,930,000 as of December31, 2007. The letter of credit can only be used to pay
principal and interest on the IRB. Any borrowings made under the letter of credit bear interest at
the banks prime rate and are secured by a lien and security interest in all of the Companys
assets. The letter of credit expires in April2010, and the Company intends to extend the letter
of credit each year as required by the IRB. Revolving Line of Credit At December31, 2007, the Company had available a $15,000,000 variable rate bank revolving
line of credit scheduled to mature on April30, 2009. The line of credit bears interest at LIBOR
plus 200 basis points or at the prime rate. The line of credit is collateralized by all the
Companys assets. At December31, 2007 there was a balance of $2,252,000 on the bank revolving line
of
credit. There was no outstanding balance on the bank revolving line of credit at December31,
2006. The outstanding balance on the line of credit is not due until April2009; however the
Company anticipates paying off the balance within the next 12months and therefore has classified
the outstanding balance as a current liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 35 Table of Contents Core Molding Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Annual maturities of long-term debt are as follows

Interest Rate Swaps In conjunction with its variable rate Industrial Revenue Bond, the Company entered into an
interest rate swap agreement, which is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument. Under this
agreement, the Company pays a fixed rate of 489% to the bank and receives 76% of the 30-day
commercial paper rate. The swap term and notional amount matches the payment schedule on the IRB
with final maturity in April2013. The difference paid or received varies as short-term interest
rates change and is accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense. While the Company
is exposed to credit loss on its interest rate swap in the event of non-performance by the
counterparty to the swap, management believes such non-performance is unlikely to occur given the
financial resources of the counterparty. The effectiveness of the swap is assessed at each
financial reporting date by comparing the commercial paper rate of the swap to the benchmark rate
underlying the variable rate of the Industrial Revenue Bond. In all periods presented this cash
flow hedge was highly effective; any ineffectiveness was recorded to interest expense. None of the
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap have been excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness. Effective January1, 2004, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which is
designated as a cash flow hedge of the bank note payable. Under this agreement, the Company pays a
fixed rate of 575% to the bank and receives LIBOR plus 200 basis points. The swap term and
notional amount matches the payment schedule on the secured note payable with final maturity in
January2011. The interest rate swap is a highly effective hedge because the amount, benchmark
interest rate index, term, and repricing dates of both the interest rate swap and the hedged
variable interest cash flows are exactly the same. While the Company is exposed to credit loss on
its interest rate swap in the event of non-performance by the counterparty to the swap, management
believes such non-performance is unlikely to occur given the financial resources of the
counterparty. Interest expense includes $28,000 of income in 2007, $26,000 of income in 2006, and $162,000
of expense in 2005 for settlements related to the swaps. Bank Covenants The Company is subject to formal debt covenants related to minimum fixed charge coverage and
total funded obligations debt ratios. As of December31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with
these covenants. Leases The Company leases a portion of its manufacturing facilities, manufacturing equipment and a
warehouse facility under operating lease agreements. During 2007 the Company purchased machinery
and equipment amounting to $1,169,000 by exercising an early buyout option and as a result a gain
of $49,000 was recognized from the reversal of a graduated lease payment liability. In August2005, in conjunction with the acquisition of the Cincinnati Fiberglass Division of
Diversified Glass, Inc., Core Composites Cincinnati, LLC entered into a 7-year operating lease
agreement through July2012 for the manufacturing facility located in Batavia, Ohio. The Company
has the option to terminate the lease effective any time after July31, 2006, by providing written
notice to the lessor no later than 90days prior to intended termination date. The Company has the
option to purchase the property at the end of every lease year. In October2001, in conjunction with the Airshield Asset Acquisition, the Companys Mexican
subsidiary entered into a 10-year operating lease agreement through October2011 for a
manufacturing facility in Matamoros, Mexico. The Company has an option to purchase the facility at
any time during the first seven years. The Company may cancel the lease upon giving six months
notice to the lessor. 36 Table of Contents Core Molding Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Total rental expense was $2,611,000, $3,892,000, and $4,195,000 for 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively. The future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases that have

8. Equity Treasury Stock On July18, 2007, the Company entered into a stock repurchase agreement with Navistar,
pursuant to which the Company repurchased 3,600,000 shares of the Companys common stock, from
Navistar in a privately negotiated transaction at $725 per share, for a total purchase price of
$26,100,000. Navistar continues to be a significant stockholder of the Companys common stock with
664,000 shares, or approximately 99% of the shares outstanding after the repurchase. Navistar is
also the Companys largest customer, accounting for approximately 44% of the Companys 2007 sales.
The Company used approximately $19million of existing cash and $71million from its revolving
line of credit to fund the repurchase. The Company also incurred approximately $115,000 in costs
related to the stock repurchase agreement, which are recorded as part of the cost of its treasury
stock. Anti-takeover Measures The Companys Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws contain certain provisions designed to
discourage specific types of transactions involving an actual or threatened change of control of
the Company. These provisions, which are designed to make it more difficult to change majority
control of the Board of Directors without its consent, include provisions related to removal of
Directors, the approval of a merger and certain other transactions as outlined in the Certificate
of Incorporation and any amendments to those provisions. Restrictions on Transfer On July16, 2007, the Board of Directors approved a Shareholders Rights Plan the Plan in
conjunction with the approval of the repurchase of shares of stock from Navistar. The Plan was
implemented to protect the interests of the Companys stockholders by encouraging potential buyers
to negotiate directly with the Board prior to attempting a takeover. Under the Plan, each
shareholder will receive a dividend of one right per share of common stock of the Company owned on
the record date, July18, 2007. The rights will not initially be exercisable until, subject to
action by the Board of Directors, a person acquires 15% or more of the voting stock without
approval of the Board. If the rights become exercisable, all holders except the party triggering
the rights shall be entitled to purchase shares of the Company at a discount. Each right entitles
the registered holder to purchase from the Company a unit consisting of one one-thousandth of a
share of SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $001 per share. In connection
with the adoption of the Rights Agreement, on July18, 2007, the Company filed a Certificate of
Designations of SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware. The Companys Certificate of Incorporation contains a provision the Prohibited Transfer
Provision designed to help assure the continued availability of the Companys previous
substantial net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards see Note 10 by seeking to prevent
an ownership change as defined under current Treasury Department income tax regulations. Under
the Prohibited Transfer Provision, if a stockholder transfers or agrees to transfer stock, the
transfer will be prohibited and void to the extent that it would cause the transferee to hold a
Prohibited Ownership Percentage as defined in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation, but
generally, means direct and indirect ownership of 45% or more of the Companys common stock or if
the transfer would result in the transferees ownership increasing if the transferee had held a
Prohibited Ownership Percentage within
the three prior years or if the transferees ownership percentage already exceeds the Prohibited
Ownership Percentage under applicable Federal income tax rules. The Prohibited Transfer Provision
does not prevent transfers of stock between persons who do not hold a Prohibited Ownership
Percentage. 37 Table of Contents Core Molding Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 9. Stock Based Compensation Core Molding Technologies has a Long Term Equity Incentive Plan the 2006 Plan, as approved
by the shareholders in May2006. This 2006 Plan replaced the Long Term Equity Incentive Plan the
Original Plan as originally approved by the shareholders in May1997 and as amended in May2000.
The 2006 Plan allows for grants to directors and key employees of non-qualified stock options,
incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares,
performance units, and other incentive awards Stock Awards up to an aggregate of 3,000,000 awards, each
representing a right to buy a share of Core Molding Technologies common stock. Stock Awards can be
granted under the 2006 Plan through the earlier of December31, 2015, or the date the maximum
number of available awards under the 2006 Plan have been granted. The options that have been granted under the 2006 Plan have vesting schedules of five or nine
and one-half years from the date of grant, or immediately upon change in ownership, are not
exercisable after ten years from the date of grant, and were granted at prices which equal or
exceed the fair market value of Core Molding Technologies common stock at the date of grant.
Restricted stock granted under the 2006 Plan require the individuals receiving the grants to
maintain certain common stock ownership thresholds and vest over three years or upon the date of
the participants sixty-fifth birthday, death, disability or change in control. Effective January1, 2006, Core Molding Technologies adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS No123R
requiring that compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in the
financial statements. The cost is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of
the award, and is recognized as an expense over the employees requisite service period generally
the vesting period of the equity award. Prior to January1, 2006, Core Molding Technologies
accounted for share-based compensation to employees in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB No25, and related
interpretations. Core Molding Technologies also followed the disclosure requirements of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure. Core Molding Technologies adopted SFAS No123R using the
modified prospective method and, accordingly, financial statement amounts for prior periods
presented in this Form 10-K have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of recognizing
compensation cost relating to non-qualified stock options. Under this method, the provisions of
SFAS 123R apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption. In addition,
compensation expense must be recognized for any unvested stock option awards outstanding as of the
date of adoption on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period. The total impact of
adoption on results of operations, net of tax benefit, recorded in 2006 was $311,000 or $03 per
basic and diluted share. Under APB No25 there was no compensation cost recognized for non-qualified stock options
awarded in the year ended December31, 2005 as these non-qualified stock options had an exercise
price equal to the market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. The following table sets
forth pro forma information as if compensation cost had been determined consistent with the
requirements of SFAS No123R.

38 Table of Contents Core Molding Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Stock Options There were no grants of options in the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006. The fair value
of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model. The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2005 was $412. The fair value of
the options granted in 2005 were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions: risk free interest rate of 437%, no expected
dividend yield, expected lives of 8 to 10years and expected volatility of 91%. Total compensation
cost related to incentive stock options for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 was $129,671
and $243,220, respectively. Compensation expense is allocated such that $96,687 and $186,151 is
included in selling, general, and administrative expenses and $32,984 and $57,069 is recorded in
cost of sales for the year ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. There was no tax benefit
recorded for this compensation cost as the expense primarily relates to incentive stock options
that do not qualify for a tax deduction until, and only if, a disqualifying disposition occurs. During the year ended December31, 2007, Core Molding Technologies received approximately
$358,000 in cash from the exercise of stock options. The aggregate intrinsic value of these
options was approximately $641,000. Tax benefits received as a result of disqualified dispositions
were $116,000. During the year ended December31, 2006, Core Molding Technologies received
approximately $485,000 in cash from the exercise of stock options. The aggregate intrinsic value
of these options was approximately $896,000. Tax benefits received as a result of disqualified
dispositions, were $280,000. During the year ended December31, 2005, Core Molding Technologies
received approximately $808,000 in cash from the exercise of stock options. The aggregate
intrinsic value of these options was approximately $1,448,000. Tax benefits received as a result
of a disqualified dispositions were $514,000. The following summarizes all stock option activity for the years ended December31

The American Jobs Creation Act provides a tax deduction calculated as a percentage of
qualified income from manufacturing in the United States. The percentage increases from 3% to 9%
over a six-year period beginning in 2005. The amount of the deduction available to the Company in
2005 was not significant, however the deduction taken in 2006 was $316,000 and the deduction is
estimated to be $289,000 in 2007. In December2004, the FASB issued a new staff position providing
for this deduction to be treated as a special deduction, as opposed to a tax rate reduction in
accordance with SFAS No109. Certain tax benefits related to incentive stock options recorded directly to additional paid
in capital totaled $116,000, $280,000 and $514,000 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Deferred tax assets liabilitiesconsist of the following at December31

At December31, 2007, a provision has not been made for U.S. taxes on accumulated
undistributed earnings of approximately $2,338,000 of the Companys Mexican subsidiary that would
become payable upon repatriation to the United States. It is the intention of the Company to
reinvest all such earnings in operations and facilities outside of the United States. On January1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48. As a result of the
implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized a $68,000 increase to the opening balance of
retained earnings. This increase is represented by the recognition of state tax benefits of
$212,000 and related accrued interest receivable of $16,000. These benefits generate a federal tax
liability of $60,000. The Company also recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of
$52,000 and $48,000 related to uncertain state and foreign tax positions, respectively, and the
amounts were recorded in accrued taxes in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 42 Table of Contents Core Molding Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Below is a reconciliation of the change in unrecognized tax benefits recorded on Consolidated
Balance Sheets from the January1, 2007 FIN 48 adoption through December31, 2007 is as follows

As of December31, 2007 the Consolidated Balance Sheets reflects a reduction of $75,000 in the
liability for unrecognized tax benefits from the January1, 2007 amount. The liability was reduced
by $48,000 to offset a $65,000 payment made to settle a foreign tax case. The payment in excess of
liability was recorded to income tax expense. The liability was also reduced by $28,000 due to
collection of state tax claims. This amount was recorded to income tax expense. The remaining
liability of $24,000 at December31, 2007 relates to uncertain state tax positions and the entire
amount if recognized would affect the effective tax rate. There are no federal or state income tax audits in process. During the year ended December31
2007, the Company recorded interest income of $9,000 from state tax refunds, which was coded to
income tax expense. During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company recorded no interest
expense or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits and no interest and penalties were
accrued on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2006. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, Mexico and various
state jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal and state income tax
examinations by tax authorities for years before 2003 due to the expiration of the statute of
limitations and is subject to income tax examinations by Mexican authorities since the Company
began business in Mexico in 2001. The Company does not anticipate that the unrecognized tax
benefits will significantly change within the next twelve months. 11. Postretirement Benefits The Company provides postretirement benefits to some of its United States employees. Costs
associated with postretirement benefits include postretirement health care and life insurance
expense and expense related to contributions to two 401k defined contribution plans. In
addition, all of the Companys United States union employees are covered under a multi-employer
defined benefit pension plan administered under a collective bargaining agreement. The Company
does not administer this plan and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions in the
negotiated labor contract. Prior to the acquisition of Columbus Plastics, certain of the Companys employees were
participants in Navistars postretirement plan. In connection with the acquisitions the
postretirement health and life insurance plan provides healthcare and life insurance for certain
employees upon their retirement, along with their spouses and certain dependents and requires cost
sharing between the Company, Navistar and the participants in the form of premiums, co-payments,
and deductibles. The Company and Navistar share the cost of benefits for certain employees, using
a formula that allocates the cost based upon the respective portion of time that the employee was
an active service participant after the acquisition of Columbus Plastics to the period of active
service prior to the acquisition of Columbus Plastics. 43 Table of Contents Core Molding Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued The funded status of the Companys postretirement health and life insurance benefits plan as
of December31, 2007 and 2006 and reconciliation with the amounts recognized in the consolidated

Effective December31, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No158, which requires the recognition
of the funded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan in the consolidated
statements of financial position. For the year ended December31, 2007, the Company recognized net
actuarial gains of $1,215,000 on the balance sheet. This amount was recorded as other
comprehensive income in the amount of $730,000, net of tax, for the year ended December31, 2007.
Upon adoption at December31, 2006 the Company recognized net actuarial losses of $4,740,000 on the
balance sheet. This was recorded as other comprehensive loss in the amount of $3,000,000, net of
tax. The amount in accumulated other comprehensive loss expected to be recognized as a component of
net periodic post retirement costs during 2008 consists of a net loss amortization of $128,000, or
$82,000 net of tax. The weighted average rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits
is projected to be 8%. The rate is projected to decrease gradually to 5% by the year 2013 and
remain at that level thereafter. The comparable assumptions for the prior year were 8% and 5 respectively. 44 Table of Contents Core Molding Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued The effect of changing the health care cost trend rate by one-percentage point for each future year

12. Related Party Transactions In connection with the acquisition of Columbus Plastics, the Company and Navistar entered into
a Supply Agreement. Under the terms of the Supply Agreement, Navistar agreed to purchase from the
Company, and the Company agreed to sell to Navistar all of Navistars original equipment and
service requirements for fiberglass reinforced parts using the Sheet Molding Compound process as
they then existed or as they may be improved or modified. In October2006, the Company renewed the
Comprehensive Supply Agreement, which was effective as of November1, 2006. Under this
Comprehensive Supply Agreement, the Company is the primary supplier of Navistars original
equipment and service requirements for fiberglass reinforced parts, as long as the Company remains
competitive in cost, quality and delivery, through October31, 2011. In 1996, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the Columbus
Plastics unit from Navistar, in return for a secured note, which has been repaid, and 4,264,000
shares of Common Stock of the Company. On July18, 2007, the Company entered into a stock
repurchase agreement with Navistar, pursuant to which the Company repurchased 3,600,000 shares of
common stock, from Navistar as detailed in Note 8 of the December31, 2007 Form 10-K. At December
31, 2007, Navistar owns 99% of the Companys outstanding common stock. Sales to Navistar were
$53,629,000 in 2007, $81,223,000 in 2006 and $66,382,000 in 2005, of which $6,144,000 and
$10,671,000 had not been received as of December31, 2007 and 2006 and were included in accounts
receivable. Receivables as of December31, 2007 and 2006 also include $443,000 and $1,008,000
respectively, for tooling costs owed by Navistar. 13. Labor Concentration As of December31, 2007, the Company employed a total of 942 employees, which consists of 571
employees in its United States operations and 371 employees in its Mexican operations. Of these 942
employees, 266 are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Association
of Machinists and Aerospace Workers IAM, which extends to August4, 2010, and 311 are covered
by a collective bargaining agreement with Sindicato de Jorneleros y Obreros, which extends to
January16, 2009. 14. Commitments and Contingencies From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of its
business. However, the Company is presently not involved in any legal proceedings which in the
opinion of management are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated
financial position or results of operations. 45 Table of Contents Core Molding Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 15.

Item5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company has carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive
Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its
disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule13a-15e of the Exchange Act. Based upon
this evaluation, the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief
Financial Officer, concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were i
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Companys reports filed or
submitted under the Exchange Act were accumulated and communicated to the Companys management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures, and iieffective to ensure that information required to

Commissions rules and forms. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
by, or under the supervision of, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
and effected by the Companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
Companys financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the Companys
financial statements would be prevented or detected. The Companys management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
the Company internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the
design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a
conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Companys
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2007. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Companys registered public
accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not
subject to attestation by the Companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary
rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only
managements report in this annual report. Changes In Internal Controls There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in
Exchange Act Rule13a-15f that occurred in the last fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
