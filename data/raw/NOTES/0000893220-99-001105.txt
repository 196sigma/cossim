1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Nature of Operations: NovaCare Employee Services, Inc. the Company is a
national professional employer organization PEO providing small and
medium-sized businesses with comprehensive, fully integrated outsourcing
solutions to human resource needs, including payroll management, workers'
compensation risk management, health care and other employee benefits
management, unemployment services, temporary staffing and human resource
consulting services. The Company provides these services to companies in a
variety of industries located primarily in the states of Florida, Arizona, New
York, Maryland, Utah, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and California.
PEO services are typically provided under a standard client service
agreement which provides for an initial one year term, and is renewed
periodically. The agreement is subject to termination without cause by the
Company or the client at any time upon 30 days' prior written notice. The
service agreement establishes a co-employment relationship whereby the Company
contractually assumes certain administrative, regulatory and financial employer
responsibilities with respect to worksite employees.
The Company was established by NovaCare, Inc. the Parent in September
1996 as a subsidiary and commenced operations in October 1996, concurrent with
the acquisition of Resource One, Inc. Resource One, a PEO based in Florida.
In February 1997, the Company acquired three additional PEOs -- Employee
Services of America, Inc. ESA, Prostaff Human Resources, Inc. Prostaff
and The TPI Group, Ltd. TPI and entered into a contract with the Parent to
co-employ substantially all of the Parent workforce the NovaCare Contract
see Note 5. The Company completed three acquisitions during the year ended
June 30, 1998, including NovaPro, a temporary staffing business, acquired from
the Parent on July 1, 1997 see Note 5, AmeriCare Employers Group, Inc.,
AmeriCare a PEO based in Phoenix, Arizona, acquired December 1, 1997 and Staff
Leasing Systems, Inc. SLS, a PEO based in Bowie, Maryland, acquired on May 1,
1998 see Note 6. The Company acquired Pay America Inc. Pay America, a PEO
based in Utah, on August 1, 1998 and Payday Professional Employer Payday, a
PEO based in New Mexico, on October 1, 1998 see Note 6.
Operating Segments: The Company has adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS 131 establishes standards for
reporting financial and descriptive information about operating segments and
related disclosures regarding products and services, geographic areas and major
customers. The adoption of SFAS 131 did not affect the Company results of
operations or financial position. The Company operates in the United States as
one business segment under SFAS 131, providing professional employer services.
Accordingly, there were no changes to, or additional disclosures required as a
result of adopting this new standard.
Principles of Consolidation: The Consolidated Financial Statements include
the operations of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Reclassifications: Certain amounts in the fiscal 1998 and 1997 consolidated
financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the fiscal 1999
presentation.
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.                    39

IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA   Revenue Recognition: Revenues and the related costs of wages, salaries, and
employment taxes pertaining to worksite employees are recognized in the period
in which the employee performs the service. Because the Company is at risk for
all of its direct costs, independently of whether payment is received from its
clients, all amounts billed to clients for gross salaries and wages, related
employment taxes, and health care and workers' compensation coverage are
recognized as revenue by the Company. Revenues relating to worksite employees
with earned but unpaid wages at the end of each period are recognized as
unbilled accounts receivable and the corresponding direct cost as an accrued
liability. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for
accounts receivable based on management judgement and prior experience.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: The Company considers its holdings of highly
liquid debt and money-market instruments to be cash equivalents if the
securities mature within 90 days from the date of acquisition. These investments
are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.
Property and Equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, which principally range from three to ten years. Assets
under capital leases and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of
the lease term or the asset estimated useful life.
Excess Cost of Net Assets Acquired: Assets and liabilities acquired in
connection with business combinations accounted for under the purchase method
are recorded at their respective fair values. Deferred taxes have been recorded
to the extent of the difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The excess of the purchase price over
the fair value of net assets acquired, including the recognition of applicable
deferred taxes, consists of non-compete agreements, customer lists, assembled
workforce, and goodwill and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from five to 40 years.
In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of SFAS 121, the Company reviews the
realizability of long-lived assets, certain intangible assets and goodwill
whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate recorded cost may not be
recoverable. The Company also reviews the overall recoverability of goodwill
based primarily on estimated future undiscounted cash flows.
If the expected future cash flows undiscounted are less than the carrying
amount of such assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the
difference between the carrying amount of the assets and their estimated fair
value. In estimating future cash flows for determining whether an asset is
impaired, and in measuring assets that are impaired, assets are grouped by
geographic market.
Workers' Compensation: The Company is contractually obligated to provide
workers' compensation coverage for its employees and co-employees. The Company
accomplishes this through a combination of various commercial insurance policies
and self insurance programs. The self insurance programs relate to
pre-acquisition workers' compensation arrangements. The Company records
estimated accruals for workers' compensation claims, including estimates for
incurred but not reported claims, based upon a review of claims activity and
past experience. Management believes any differences which may arise between
actual settlement of claims and reserves at June 30, 1999 would not have a
material effect on the Company financial position.
On July 1, 1997, the Company entered into a three-year contract with a
commercial insurance company for workers' compensation coverage. Under this
program, the Parent worksite employees and third party worksite employees are
covered under a fixed cost insurance program, which is subject to certain per
incident and aggregate deductibles.                    40

Options to purchase 1,464 shares of common stock for the year ended June
30, 1999 were not included as common stock equivalents in the computation of net
income per share-assuming dilution because the effect would be antidilutive. As
part of certain purchase agreements, the former stockholders are eligible to
receive additional shares of the Company common stock contingent upon
achieving certain financial and operating criteria over multiple reporting
periods. Approximately 4,600 contingently issuable shares were not included in
the computation of net income per share-assuming dilution because all specified
financial and operating conditions have not been satisfied. There were no
transactions occurring subsequent to June 30, 1999 that would have materially
changed the number of shares used in computing net income per share-basic or net
income per share-assuming dilution.
Comprehensive Income: The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. SFAS 130 establishes standards for
reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set
of general-purpose financial statements. Comprehensive income is defined as the
total of net income and all other non-owner changes in equity. There have not
been any non-owner changes in equity other than net income. Comprehensive income
is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards: The Company has adopted SFAS No. 132,
Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. This
pronouncement revises employers' disclosures about pension and other
postretirement benefit plans. SFAS 132 does not change the measurement or
recognition of those plans, however, it does require additional information on
changes in the benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets in order to
facilitate financial analysis. The Company does not have any defined benefit
pension plans or postretirement benefit plans; therefore, the adoption of SFAS
132 did not have a material impact on the Company disclosures.
In March 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position SOP
98-1 Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use. The SOP is effective for the year ending June 30, 2000.
Management does not believe the adoption of SOP 98-1 will have a material effect
on the Company financial position or results of operations.
In June 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued SOP 98-5 Reporting on the Cost
of Start-Up Activities which the Company is required to adopt no later than
June 30, 2000. SOP 98-5 provides the reporting standards for the costs of
start-up activities, including organizational costs, which should be expensed as
incurred. Management does not believe the adoption of SOP 98-5 will have a
material effect on the Company financial position or results of operations.
2. STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES REVIEW AND SALE OF COMPANY
On August 13, 1999, the Parent sent a proxy statement Proxy Statement
to its stockholders asking them to consider and vote upon proposals to approve:
i the sale of the Parent outpatient physical rehabilitation and occupational
health business the PROH Sale, ii the sale of the Parent interest in the
Company the NCES Sale and iii the adoption of the Plan of Restructuring of
the Parent the Restructuring Proposal. On September 21, 1999 the Parent
stockholders approved the three proposals noted above.
On September 8, 1999 the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell the
Company to an investment group comprised of Patricof & Co. Ventures
Incorporated, Fidelity Ventures Limited and AFLAC Incorporated the
Investors. Under the terms of the agreement, a new private company
established by the Investors will acquire all of the outstanding common stock of
the Company at a price of $250 per share. The purchase will be effected through
a cash tender offer to the Company stockholders and subsequent merger of the
Company into a new private company managed by the Investors. The Parent also
executed a definitive agreement, subject to certain conditions, to tender its
shares in the tender offer at the price of $250 per share. The tender offer is
subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The tender offer
will commence on or about September 15, 1999 and is expected to close during
October 1999.                    42

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
JUNE 30, 1999
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA   The Parent is in the process of seeking a buyer for its PROH business. The
Parent anticipates that the PROH Sale will be structured as a stock sale. While,
to date, no definitive agreement has been entered into with respect to the PROH
Sale, the Parent is seeking stockholder approval to proceed with the sale when a
suitable buyer is identified and a definitive agreement is negotiated with such
buyer. The consummation of the sale would be subject to the receipt by the
Parent of the minimum sales price set forth in the Proxy Statement, obtaining
the opinion of financial advisors in connection with the sale and approval by
the Board of Directors of the Parent of the terms of any definitive sale
agreement. Except as requested in the Proxy Statement, no further stockholder
vote will be solicited by the Parent for the PROH Sale or the NCES Sale.
Accordingly, the Parent stockholders will not have the opportunity to vote on
the definitive sale agreements.
With the approved Plan of Restructuring, the Parent intends to seek to
reinvest the net proceeds to the Parent from the PROH Sale and the NCES Sale,
after the payment of liabilities, in a new business or businesses. Any such
reinvestment would be subject to the further vote and approval of the
stockholders of the Parent. If the Parent is unable, or chooses not, to reinvest
any proceeds in a new business or businesses, the Parent will liquidate. 3. PROVISION FOR RESTRUCTURE
On March 31, 1999, the Parent announced that, due primarily to lower
reimbursement rates and to declines in caseloads at long-term care services
customer facilities, resulting from the new reimbursement structure for therapy
under the Medicare program, it would be forced to exit selected long-term care
markets and facilities, and would continue to lower expenses by reducing labor
costs. On June 1, 1999, the Parent sold its remaining long-term care services
business. In addition, on July 1, 1999, the Parent sold its orthotics and
prosthetics division. Based on these events, the Company and the Parent
negotiated new contract terms to reflect changes in the Parent ongoing service
needs. The new contract terms, which became effective July 1, 1999, reduce the
scope of services provided to the Parent remaining business.
In response to the above, the Company commenced a restructuring of its
NovaCare Contract and temporary staffing operations and recorded a pretax
provision for restructuring of $910 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999. The
provision consists principally of employee severance costs for the termination
of approximately 50 employees, which represent the accumulation of termination
benefits set forth in the Company severance policy, and lease termination
costs to reduce three facilities to levels more appropriate to current business
requirements.
The following table sets forth the components of the Company provision
for restructure

4. INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
On November 14, 1997, the Company completed an initial public offering of
5,000 shares of its common stock the Offering. Subsequent to the Offering,
the Company issued an additional 750 shares pursuant to the exercise of an
over-allotment provision, for a total issuance of 5,750 shares. The net proceeds
from the Offering, including the exercise of the over-allotment provision,
after deducting offering costs of $6,041, amounted to $45,709 and were used by
the Company to pay the Company outstanding revolving credit loan of $28,382
from the Parent and pay $17,172 to retire deferred purchase obligations. The
remaining proceeds have been allocated for general corporate purposes.
5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In return for its efforts as the founder, its initial investment of $40 and
the use of the Parent trademark, the Company issued 18,200 shares as adjusted
for the common stock split -- see Note 12 of common stock to the Parent. Given
that the transactions were between companies under common control, the issuance
of shares was recorded at the cost basis of the Parent. The excess of the
consideration given to the Parent over the Parent cost basis in the assets
transferred was recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital, the same
account credited upon issuance of the shares. Therefore, the transaction had no
net effect on shareholders' equity.
Effective October 1996, the Company entered into a line of credit agreement
with the Parent which provided for an unspecified availability. Interest was
charged to the Company at the Parent borrowing rate, which was the EuroDollar
rate plus a range of 05% to 1125%. The weighted average borrowing rate for
fiscal 1998 and 1997 was 68% and 66%, respectively. The line of credit
agreement terminated upon completion of the Company initial public offering,
at which time all outstanding amounts were paid to the Parent see Note 4.
In February 1997, the Parent and the Company entered into the NovaCare
Contract, whereby substantially all of the Parent employees became co-employed
by the Company. Under the NovaCare Contract, the Company provided traditional
PEO services such as payroll and benefits administration, worksite safety
evaluation, employment-related risk management and compensation and benefits
consultation. The Parent paid the Company a fee for its services equal to the
salary and Federal payroll costs plus an average base fee of 97% of gross
earnings of employees, or approximately 117% of the gross payroll covered by the
NovaCare Contract. Effective July 1, 1998, the NovaCare Contract was amended,
whereby the Company agreed to provide the existing PEO services and a broader
array of services, including recruiting, employee training and orientation,
outplacement and human resource consulting. The amended contract was principally
a fee-for-service contract, replacing the previous payment arrangement, which
was priced as a percentage of payroll, as described above. During the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company and the Parent negotiated new contract terms
to reflect changes in the Parent ongoing service needs see Note 3. The new
contract became effective July 1, 1999, for a period of four years relative to
the PROH business and for six-months relative to the Parent corporate support
services personnel, and provides for PEO services such as payroll and benefits
administration, worksite safety evaluation, employment related risk management
and compensation and benefits consultation. The new contract is principally a
fee-for-service contract.
The Parent may not terminate the NovaCare Contract except in the event of:
i the breach of any of the Company agreements, duties, or performance
standards under the NovaCare Contract; ii the Company making false or
misleading representations, warranties, or statements of material fact in
documents submitted by or on behalf of the Parent; or iii the insolvency,
bankruptcy, or receivership of the Company.                    44

The Parent is the Company only customer with revenue concentrations in
excess of ten percent. Related party revenues totaled $685,487, $772,168 and
$255,289 of consolidated revenues for fiscal 1999, fiscal 1998 and for the
period October 1, 1996 inception to June 30, 1997, respectively.
During fiscal 1998 and 1997, the Parent subleased office space to the
Company. The sublease was a month-to-month arrangement, terminable on 30 days'
notice by either party, under which the Company paid the Parent approximately $9
per month which equaled the Parent cost. The agreement was terminated in
October 1997, concurrent with the Company relocation to the new corporate
headquarters.
The Parent also provides general administrative and financial services to
the Company on an as-needed basis at the Parent cost. During fiscal 1999, 1998
and 1997, the Company reimbursed the Parent for such expenses, in the amount of
$80, $220 and $160, respectively, based upon estimates of time incurred by the
Parent personnel on behalf of the Company.
Effective July 1, 1997, the Company issued 1,200 shares of its common
stock, valued at $5,400, to acquire the assets and liabilities of NovaPro,
formerly a business of the Parent, in a transaction accounted for as a purchase.
Given that the transaction was between companies under common control, the
transfer of assets and liabilities was recorded at the historical cost basis of
the Parent. The excess paid over the historical cost has been treated as a
reduction of additional paid-in capital, the same account credited upon issuance
of the shares. Therefore the transaction had no effect on shareholders' equity.
The terms of the aforementioned related party transactions are equivalent
to those that would result from transactions among unrelated parties.
6. ACQUISITIONS
During the year ended June 30, 1999, the Company acquired two PEO
businesses. On August 1, 1998, the Company acquired Pay America, a PEO based in
Salt Lake City, Utah. On October 1, 1998, the Company acquired Payday, a PEO
based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The purchase price of both acquisitions was
comprised of cash, shares of the Company common stock and future contingent
payments. The cash portion of the purchase price was partially funded through
borrowings from the Company revolving credit facility with the remainder
generated from operations.
During the year ended June 30, 1998, the Company acquired two PEO
businesses see Note 1 and one temporary staffing business from the Parent see
Note 5. During the period ended June 30, 1997, the Company acquired four PEO
businesses, which included the initial platform acquisition see Note 1.

The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. Accordingly, a portion of the purchase price was allocated to net
assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. Net assets acquired
consisted primarily of accounts receivable and property and equipment.
Certain purchase agreements require additional payments if specific
financial targets and/or operating conditions are met. Aggregate contingent
payments in connection with these acquisitions at June 30, 1999 of approximately
6,500 shares of common stock have not been included in the initial determination
of cost of the businesses acquired since the amount of such contingent
consideration, if any, is not presently determinable. At June 30, 1998, 484
shares of common stock valued at $4,600 were accrued. The Company issued 830
shares of common stock in fiscal 1999 and in fiscal 1998 paid $1,555 in cash and
issued 93 shares of common stock in connection with these agreements.
Deferred current and long-term guaranteed purchase price obligations were
$1,200 at June 30, 1999. Obligations at June 30, 1998 totaled $6,206, consisting
of $1,606 in guaranteed payments and $4,600 accrued for contingent

In November 1997, the Company entered into a three year revolving credit
facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility provides for interest
at a variable rate, depending on certain financial ratios, equal to a the
EuroDollar rate plus a range of 1375% to 250% or b the lead lender prime
rate plus a range of 0125% to 125%. The weighted average borrowing rate for
fiscal 1999 was 77%. In addition, the Company has agreed to pay a commitment
fee ranging from 030% to 050% per annum on the unused portion of the
commitment. Loans made under the credit facility are collateralized by a pledge
of all of the i Company interest in the common stock of its subsidiaries,
ii assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, and iii Parent interest in
the common stock of the Company. The revolving credit facility requires the
maintenance of minimum capitalization and net worth amounts, capital expenditure
thresholds as well as certain financial ratios. At June 30, 1999, the Company
was in compliance with these requirements. The unused portion of the credit
facility at June 30, 1999 was $23,000.

In fiscal 1997, the Company acquired net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $6,000, of which $4,000 is remaining at June 30, 1999, expiring
through 2010. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the Code, placed certain
restrictions on the use of net operating loss carryforwards acquired through
purchase transactions. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance was in place,
against these amounts, at June 30, 1998. During 1999, the Code was modified,
regarding the use of net operating loss carryforwards acquired in purchase
transactions, allowing the Company to reverse the valuation allowance placed
against these amounts. Because the valuation allowance was recorded as a
component of purchase accounting at the acquisition date, the reversal of the
valuation allowance resulted in a corresponding reduction in goodwill.

Federal statutory tax rate to income before income taxes to actual tax expense

Preferred Stock
On inception, the Board of Directors authorized 1,000 shares of preferred
stock with a par value of $01 per share. There were no shares issued or
outstanding at any time during the period from inception to June 30, 1999.
Common Stock
During the period from October 1, 1996 inception through June 30, 1997,
five employees purchased 430 shares of the Company common stock. The Chief
Executive Officer of the Company purchased 375 shares of the Company common
stock on January 10, 1997 at the fair market value of $192 per share. The other
shares were purchased on various dates from February 28, 1997 through June 10,
1997 at the fair market value of $280 per share.
On January 2, 1997, the Board of Directors declared a four-for-one stock
split of the Company common stock to shareholders of record on January 2,
1997. All references in the financial statements to per share amounts have been
retroactively restated to reflect the change in the number of common shares
outstanding as a result of the stock split. Accordingly, $126 was transferred
from additional paid-in capital to common stock, representing the par value of
additional shares issued.
On November 14, 1997, the Company completed the Offering of 5,000 shares of
its common stock. Subsequent to the Offering an additional 750 shares were
issued pursuant to the exercise of an over-allotment provision, for a total
issuance of 5,750 shares see Note 4. Simultaneously with the completion of the
Offering, all 813 shares of mandatorily redeemable common stock were converted
into common stock see Note 13.
During the year ended June 30, 1999, the Company issued 1,758 shares of
common stock, in connection with fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997 acquisitions see
Note 6.                    50

IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA Treasury Stock
On January 2, 1997, the Company repurchased 563 shares of mandatorily
redeemable common stock from a former owner of an acquired business. Upon
repurchase, the mandatorily redeemable common stock became a component of
permanent equity. Accordingly, the 563 shares and the related par value and
additional paid-in capital associated with these shares were reflected in the
accompanying consolidated statement of shareholders' equity as treasury stock,
stated at cost. On December 1, 1997, 563 shares were reissued from the treasury
as part of the acquisition purchase price of AmeriCare. At June 30, 1998, there
were no shares held in the treasury. During the year ended June 30, 1999, the
Company repurchased 24 shares of common stock from a former owner of an acquired
business.
Deferred Compensation
On August 8 and September 5, 1997, the Company granted options to certain
executives, in conjunction with compensation agreements, to purchase shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $450 per share. There was no trading
market for the common stock as of each respective date. For financial statement
purposes, a fair market value for the common stock was determined by the Board
of Directors to be $712 on August 8, 1997 and $900 on September 5, 1997.
Accordingly, the Company has recorded deferred compensation expense based on the
difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the common
stock on the date of grant, in the aggregate amount of $124. This amount is
recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of five years, on a
straight-line basis. The unamortized portion of deferred compensation is
recorded as a reduction to shareholders' equity. At June 30, 1999 and 1998, the
remaining unamortized portion of deferred compensation amounted to $78 and $103,
respectively.
13. MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE COMMON STOCK
In connection with the acquisitions described in Note 1, 1,376 shares as
adjusted for the stock split -- see Note 12 of common stock were issued subject
to an agreement which provides certain registration rights with respect to the
common stock, as well as the right, two years from the date of acquisition, to
put the shares to the Company at a price of $1600 per share. The put option was
rendered inoperative due to the Company completion of the Offering prior to
December 31, 1998.
Of the 1,376 shares, 750 as adjusted for the stock split, 375 and 155
were issued, as of the date of acquisition, to the selling shareholders of
Resource One, ESA and TPI, respectively, at the fair market value of $120 per
share as adjusted for the stock split for Resource One and $248 for ESA and
TPI. Subsequent to the date of acquisition, contingent and non-contingent
payments of 41, 44, and 11 shares were issued with respect to the Resource One,
ESA and Prostaff acquisitions, respectively, at the fair market value of $280
per share.
The mandatorily redeemable common stock was recorded at the fair value at
the date of issuance. The excess of the put price over the carrying value was
accreted by periodic charges to retained earnings or additional paid-in capital,
as applicable, over a two year period. As of June 30, 1997, 813 shares of
mandatorily redeemable common stock were outstanding. During fiscal 1998 and the
period from October 1, 1996 inception to June 30, 1997, the Company recorded
$1,185 and $1,033, respectively, of accretion to retained earnings and
additional paid-in capital. On November 11, 1997, in conjunction with the
Offering, all 813 shares were converted into common stock.                    51

Stock Option Plan   On February 28, 1997, the Company Board of Directors adopted and its
shareholders approved the Company 1997 Stock Option Plan the Plan under
which 625 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of
stock options. On November 24, 1997, the Plan was amended to increase the number
of shares reserved for issuance to 1,625, and limit the maximum number of
options which may be granted to any person under the Plan during any fiscal year
to 200 shares. On December 8, 1998, the Plan was amended to increase the number
of shares reserved for issuance to 3,125. As of the same date, the Company
repriced all outstanding options with prices in excess of $600 to $581 per
share. The new option price was determined based upon the fair market value per
share at December 8, 1998. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized
since the exercise price was equal to the market value per share. Under the
Plan, substantially all options are granted for a term of up to 10 years at
prices equal to the fair value at the date of grant. Options granted generally
are exercisable over a five year period, although vesting can be accelerated if
the Company stock price achieves stated levels.
The following summarizes the activity of the Plan                                                         FOR THE PERIOD

options were grouped together for purposes of valuation based upon vesting
periods and the date of grant. The weighted average fair value of the stock
options, calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, granted during
the fiscal year ended June 30 1999, 1998 and 1997 was $447, $563 and $082,

and the Company were $5,193, $4,508 and $1,612, respectively. The Company and
the Parent also co-sponsored a non-qualified supplemental benefit plan covering
certain key employees. This plan was terminated in March 1999. The matching
contributions made on behalf of the Parent and the Company were $845, $859 and
$166 for fiscal 1999, 1998 and the period October 1, 1996 inception to June
30, 1997, respectively.
The Company subsidiaries maintain defined contribution 401k plans
covering certain of their employees and third party worksite employees. The
Company contributes, on behalf of each participating client, varying amounts
based on client elections. The Company contributions for fiscal 1999, 1998 and
the period from October 1, 1996 inception to June 30, 1997 were $850, $456 and
$85, respectively.
15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Commitments   In July 1999, the Company entered into agreements with a nationally
recognized software and technology provider and a leading information management
consulting firm to develop and implement an enterprise wide information system
for operating and financial applications. The cost of this commitment, including
computer hardware, software and other related costs, approximates $2,700 and is
projected to be expended during fiscal 2000.                    53

Contingencies   The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the
ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of management, the amount of
ultimate liability, if any, with respect to these actions will not have a
materially adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of
the Company.
The Company operations are subject to numerous Federal, state and local
laws related to employment, taxes and benefit plan matters. Generally, these
regulations affect all companies in the United States. However, the regulatory
environment for PEOs is an evolving area due to uncertainties resulting from the
non-traditional employment relationship created by PEOs. Many Federal and state
laws relating to tax and employment matters were enacted prior to the
development of PEO companies and do not specifically address the obligations and
responsibilities of these co-employer relationships. The Internal Revenue
Service IRS has conducted a market segment study of the PEO industry the
Market Segment Study focusing on selected PEOs not including the Company
for the purpose of examining the relationship among PEOs, their clients,
worksite employees, and the worksite owners. IRS officials indicate that the
Market Segment Study is near completion and suggest that an announcement of the
IRS' position with respect to PEOs has been delayed pending the outcome of
legislation that has been proposed by the PEO industry. If the IRS concludes
that PEOs are not employers of certain worksite employees for purposes of the
Internal Revenue Code, the Company benefit plans including cafeteria, health
and welfare, and retirement plans may lose their favorable tax status, and the
Company may no longer be able to assume its clients' Federal employment tax
withholding obligations. The Company believes that, although unfavorable to the
Company, a prospective application by the IRS of an adverse conclusion would not
have a material effect on its financial position and results of operations. A
retrospective application by the IRS could have a material adverse effect on the
Company business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
While the Company believes that a retrospective disqualification is unlikely,
there can be no assurance as to the ultimate resolution of these issues.
