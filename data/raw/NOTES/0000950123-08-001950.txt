Item5. Controls and Procedures Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief
Financial Officer CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as such term is defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act as of
the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. There are inherent limitations to the
effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of
human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even
effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving
their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to
be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Our management has 39 Table of Contents assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2007. In making its assessment, management has used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations COSOof the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework. Our management concluded that based on its assessment, our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2007. The Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2007 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report on the Companys internal
control over financial reporting, which is included in this annual report. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter
ended December31, 2007 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. Item9B. Other Information Not applicable. 40 Table of Contents PART III. The information required to be filed by PartIII Items 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 is hereby

F-1 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of ATMI, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ATMI, Inc. as of December31,
2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007. Our audits also included
the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at a. These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of ATMI, Inc. at December31, 2007 and 2006, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Share-Based Payment, effective January1, 2006. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
