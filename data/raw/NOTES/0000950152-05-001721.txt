II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts     *Not part of audited financial information 35 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Tollgrade Communications, Inc. We have completed an integrated audit of Tollgrade Communications, Inc.s 2004 consolidated
financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004
and audits of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our
audits, are presented below. Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tollgrade Communications, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Managements Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A, that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004 based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO. The Companys management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over
financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting
includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. 36 Table of Contents A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

The accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated
financial statements. 41 Table of Contents TOLLGRADE COMMUNICATIONS,
INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ORGANIZATION, BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION Tollgrade Communications, Inc. the Company designs, engineers, markets and supports test
system, test access and status monitoring products and test software for the telecommunications and
cable television industries primarily in the United States. The Companys telecommunications
proprietary test access products enable telephone companies to use their existing line test systems
to remotely diagnose problems in Plain Old Telephone Service POTS lines containing both copper
and fiber optics. The Companys test system products, specifically the DigiTest test platform,
focus on helping local exchange carriers conduct the full range of fault diagnosis along with the
ability to pre-qualify, deploy and maintain next-generation services including Digital Subscriber
Line service. The Companys cable products consist of a complete cable status monitoring system
that provides a comprehensive testing solution for the Broadband Hybrid Fiber Coax distribution
system. The status monitoring system consists of a host for user interface, control and
configuration; a headend controller for managing network communications; and transponders that are
strategically located within the cable network to gather status reports from power supplies, line
amplifiers and fiber-optic nodes. The Company was organized in 1986 and began operations in 1988. USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. The actual results experienced by the
Company could differ from those estimates. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS The Company considers highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents. Substantially all of the Companys cash and cash equivalents are
maintained at one financial institution. No collateral or security is provided on these deposits,
other than $100,000 of deposits per financial institution which is insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation. INVESTMENTS Short-term investments at December31, 2004 and 2003 consisted of individual municipal bonds stated
at cost, which approximated market value. These securities have maturities of one year or less at
date of purchase and/or contain a callable provision in which the bonds can be called within one
year from date of purchase. The primary investment purpose is to provide a reserve for future
business purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures. Realized gains and losses are
computed using the specific identification method. The Company classifies its investment in all debt securities as held to maturity as the Company
has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Companys assessment of the collectibility of
customer accounts. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as
historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable balances, and current
economic conditions that may affect a customers ability to pay. INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on the first-in,
first-out method. The Company provides appropriate reserves for any inventory deemed slow moving or
obsolete. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the related lease period or the
estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. The cost of renewals and betterments that extend the lives or productive capacities of properties
is capitalized. Expenditures for normal repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as
incurred. The cost of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of and the related
accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or
loss is reflected in current operations. RECEIVABLE FROM OFFICER The Company extended a loan for $210,000 under a promissory note to an officer of the Company in
July2001. The note provides for interest at 5% per annum with repayment under various conditions
but no later than May20, 2008. The loan was originally secured by collateral which currently has
no value. The balance of the loan at December31, 2004 and 2003 was $156,392, and $160,940
respectively. The principal and interest were current at December31, 2004 and 2003. 42 Table of Contents PRODUCT WARRANTY The Company records estimated warranty costs on the accrual basis of accounting. These reserves are
based on applying historical returns to the current level of product shipments and the cost
experience associated therewith. In the case of software, the reserves are based on the expected
cost of providing services within the agreed-upon warranty period. Activity in the warranty accrual

REVENUE RECOGNITION We market and sell test system hardware and related software to the telecommunications and
cable television industries. The Company follows Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB104, Revenue
Recognition for hardware and software sales. This bulletin requires, among other things, that
revenue should be recognized only when title has transferred and risk of loss has passed to a
customer with the capability to pay, and that there are no significant remaining obligations of the
Company related to the sale. The bulk of our hardware sales are made to RBOCs and other large
customers. Terms of these hardware sales are predominantly FOB shipping point. Revenue is
recognized for these customers upon shipment against a valid purchase order. For software perpetual license fee and maintenance revenue, we follow not only SAB 104, but
also the AICPAs Statement of Position SOP97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, and Emerging
Issues Task Force EITFIssue 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables. These statements require that software license fee revenue be recorded only when
evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the software has been delivered, and a customer with the
capacity to pay has accepted the software, leaving no significant obligations on the part of the
Company to perform. We require a customer purchase order or other written agreement to document
the terms of a software order and written, unqualified acceptance from the customer prior to
revenue recognition. In certain limited cases, however, agreements provide for automatic customer
acceptance after the passage of time from a pre-determined event and we have relied on these
provisions for an indication of the timing of revenue recognition. In isolated cases for orders of
custom software, or orders that require significant software customization over a long period of
time, such as that associated with our contract with Lucent for test gear deployment in Saudi
Arabia, we employ contract accounting using the percentage-of-completion method, whereby revenue is
recognized based on costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost. Revenue
recognized under the percentage of completion method during 2004, 2003, and 2002 was not
significant. The revenue for orders with multiple deliverables such as hardware, software and/or
installation or other services may be separated into stand-alone fair values if not already
documented in the purchase order or agreement and where list prices or other objective evidence of
fair value exists to support such allocation, in accordance with the provisions of EITF Issue
00-21. Revenue will not be recognized for any single element until all essential elements are
delivered and accepted. Revenue from Services testability consulting is recognized upon services
being rendered. Reimbursement for out-of-pocket costs is recognized as revenue and simultaneously
recognized as the cost of product sales. All fees billed to customers for shipping and handling are
classified as a component of product revenue and simultaneously recognized as the cost to product
sales. Revenue from Services also includes revenue from maintenance agreements. Maintenance
revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the related agreement,
which is typically one year. Customer advances and amounts due from customers in excess of revenue
recognized are recorded as deferred income. Revenue for license and royalty fees is recognized
when earned. GOODWILL AND PURCHASED AND OTHER INTANGIBLES Goodwill and intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No142 SFAS 142 requires goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives to be reviewed at least annually. Determination of recoverability for
indefinite lived assets is based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting
from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. We have determined that we only have one
operating unit and test goodwill for impairment by comparing the aggregate market value of the
Companys stock with our book carrying value. SFAS 142 also required that intangible assets with
definite lives and other long lived assets to be amortized over their estimated useful life and
reviewed for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No144
SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Live Assets. No impairments have
been recorded to date. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS Research and development costs to develop or improve hardware-related products are charged to
operations as incurred. CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS Any costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of software to be sold or otherwise
marketed are expensed as research and development costs. Costs incurred subsequent to the
establishment of technological feasibility, and prior to the general availability of the product to
the public are capitalized and subsequently amortized under the straight-line method. The Company
defines technological feasibility as coding and testing in accordance with detailed program
designs. Internally generated software development costs that have been capitalized were, $68,100
in 2002, $115,383 in 2003, and $107,690 in 2004. Such costs are being amortized over five years. 43 Table of Contents INCOME TAXES The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under SFAS No.
109, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount
expected to be realized. SEGMENT INFORMATION The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information, Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business. This statement
establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments, products and services,
geographic areas and major customers in annual and interim financial statements. The Company
manages and operates its business as one segment. International sales were 76% of revenue in 2004,
58% in 2003 and 63% in 2002. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES In June1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No138, Accounting for
Certain Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, and SFAS No, 149, Amendment of Statement 133
on Derivative Instruments and Hedging. This statement establishes standards for reporting
information about various derivative financial instruments and accounting for their change in fair
value. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for hedging purposes and,
therefore, this standard does not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or
results of operations of the Company. RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform with the current year
presentation. These reclassifications were related to the consolidated statement of cash flows and
did not result in a change to net cash provided usedin operating, investing or financing
activities and had no effect on reported net income. ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company has two stock-based employee compensation plans which are described more fully in Note
6. The Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic
value method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25. Under these provisions, stock-based
employee compensation cost is not reflected in net income for any year, as all options granted
under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on
the date of grant. If the Company had elected to recognize compensation cost for these stock
options based on the fair value method set forth in SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, net income lossand earnings lossper share would have reflected the pro forma
amounts indicated in the following table

2. ACQUISITIONS On February13, 2003, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the
Cheetah status and performance monitoring product line Cheetah from Acterna, LLC Acterna
for approximately $14,300,000 in cash. In addition, acquisition-related costs of approximately
$599,000 were capitalized for a total cost of approximately $14,899,000. The transaction provided
for an earnout to be paid in the first half of 2004 of up to $2,400,000 based on certain 2003
performance targets. As of December31, 2004 we were still negotiating the earnout payment and the
current calculation indicates that amounts due under this provision are immaterial. The acquired
assets consist principally of existing sales order backlog, product inventory, intellectual
property, software and related computer equipment, while the assumed liabilities principally relate
to deferred software maintenance, warranty and other obligations. The $14,300,000 due at closing
and related acquisition expenses were paid from available cash and short-term investments. The
acquisition was recorded under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the provisions
of SFAS No141, Business Combinations and SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
and accordingly, the results of operations of the acquired product line from February14, 2003
forward are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. 44 Table of Contents The Company has made an allocation of the Cheetah purchase price to the fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. The purchase price remains subject to change pending resolution
of the continuing negotiations regarding the earn-out provision and post closing purchase price
adjustments. Any changes to the purchase price are expected to be accounted for as adjustments to
goodwill and may be material. The following summarizes the current estimated fair values as of the date of the Cheetah
acquisition

An independent valuation consultant assisted management in its initial determination of fair value
assigned to certain intangible assets other than goodwill. Discounted future cash flow models were
utilized where appropriate. The Cheetah product line has maintained a significant market share in cable status and performance
monitoring equipment for more than 25years and has a large installed customer base, including many
of the largest multiple system cable operators. The Company has assumed that, on average,
approximately 85% of future revenues attributable to Cheetah products will be derived from this
customer base and, based on prior experience, does not anticipate turnover or loss of these
customers. Therefore, the Company has concluded that the customer base and Cheetah trademark
intangible assets have an indefinite life. Consequently, in accordance with SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the values assigned to customer base and the Cheetah
trademark, as well as to related goodwill, are not being amortized for financial reporting
purposes. The Company intends that the base software will be used in future releases of CheetahNet formerly
NetMentor and other software products with little change into the foreseeable future. Similarly,
the proprietary technology embedded in transponder hardware is designed to have a relatively long
useful life. Therefore, the Company has determined that the base software and proprietary software
have a remaining useful life of ten years and are being amortized for financial reporting purposes
over that period. For tax purposes, the Company is amortizing all intangible assets over 15years. Goodwill deducted
for tax purposes amounted to $1,077,000 in 2002, $1,265,000 in 2003 and $1,308,000 in 2004. The following condensed proforma results of operations reflect the proforma combination of the

Revenues for 2002, cost of sales and operating expenses for proforma determinations were based on
historical information provided by Acterna with proforma adjustments made to adjust gross margins
to 50% of revenues and to adjust operating expenses based upon the Companys financial plan for
Cheetah for 2003. These adjustments were made to reflect significant changes to operations made by
the Company since the acquisition. This proforma financial information is presented for
comparative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that actually
would have incurred had the Cheetah product line acquisition been consummated on January1, 2002.
In addition, these results are not intended to be a projection of future results. 45 Table of Contents 3. INTANGIBLE ASSETS SFAS No142 provides that entities evaluate the remaining useful lives of intangible assets
determined to have indefinite useful lives periodically to determine whether events and
circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life and that such assets be tested at least
annually for impairment of value. The Companys policy is to test all intangible assets for
impairment in value as of December31 of each year or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.
The Company has determined that it has only one reporting unit and has completed a test for
goodwill impairment as of December31, 2004 by comparing the aggregate market value of the
Companys stock with the Companys book carrying value, including goodwill. This test indicated
that there was no impairment of the goodwill carrying value. All other intangible assets were tested for impairment of carrying value as of December31, 2004
using assumptions and techniques employed in the original valuations and following the guidance of
SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Specifically, the
sum of the projected future cash flows to be derived from assets with definite lives was compared
with the net book carrying value. The impairment test for non-amortizable intangible assets other
than goodwill consisted of a comparison of the estimated fair value with carrying amounts. The
values of the LoopCare trade name and Cheetah trademark were measured using the relief-from-royalty
method and discounted cash flow analyses were employed to test the value of the LoopCare base
software and post warranty maintenance service agreements and the value of the Cheetah customer
base. These tests indicated that none of the intangible assets had impairment in carrying value.
The Company will retest these assets annually as of December31 or more frequently if events or
changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. The following information is provided regarding the Companys intangible assets and goodwill

46 Table of Contents We have entered into certain third party license agreements to augment our next-generation
technology. During the first quarter of 2004, the Company entered into a License Agreement
Initial Agreement with a third party software vendor for certain Voice Over Internet Protocol
VoIP technology, pursuant to which the Company obtained a non-exclusive license to use, further
develop and incorporate into certain of its products such technology. In conjunction with this
agreement during the first quarter of 2004, we prepaid approximately $03million in services,
license and non-refundable royalty fees. The Initial Agreement was replaced and superseded by a second license agreement during the second
quarter of 2004, pursuant to which the Company obtained a perpetual worldwide right and license to
use, further develop and incorporate such technology into any of its products. Additionally, the
agreement provides that during the term of the agreement, the Company is the sole and exclusive
licensee for particular applications of this technology. The agreement is for a period of five
years. In conjunction with this agreement, the Company paid approximately $07million for the
exclusivity right and prepaid approximately $01million of additional non-refundable royalty fees.
Royalty expense will be recognized based on the underlying related products sales. The
exclusivity fee will be amortized on a straight line basis over the five year contract period
effective April1, 2004. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2004, we purchased certain software from a third party
for $05million, the value of what is recorded as capitalized software in the accompanying balance
sheet. The Company is currently modifying the software for sale in the latter part of 2005. 4. INVENTORIES Inventories consisted of the following

December31, 2003 and 2004, there were 13,118,570 and 13,161,140 outstanding shares, respectively. STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM Under previously authorized share repurchase programs, the Company had repurchased 461,800 shares
of Tollgrade common stock as of December31, 2002. These purchases of treasury stock were intended
to make those shares available under the Companys long term incentive compensation plans. On
January22, 2003, the Board of Directors authorized the continuation of the share repurchase
program to repurchase a total of one million shares of the Companys common stock before December
31, 2003. During 2003, the Company did not repurchase any common stock. 47 Table of Contents On January21, 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the continuation of the share repurchase
program under which the Company may repurchase a total of one million shares of its common stock
before December31, 2004. During 2004, the Company did not purchase any common stock. On January
27, 2005, The Board of Directors authorized the continuation of the share repurchase program under
which the Company may repurchase up to a total of one million shares of its common stock before
December31, 2005. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS Under the Companys stock compensation plans, directors, officers and other employees may be
granted options to purchase shares of the Companys common stock. The option price on all
outstanding options is equal to the fair market value of the stock at the date of the grant, as
defined. The options generally vest ratably over a two-year period, with one-third vested upon
grant and expire ten years from the date of grant. The Companys option programs cover all
employees and are used to attract and retain qualified personnel in all positions. On February19, 1999, the Board of Directors approved a proposal to increase the number of shares
under the 1995 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan the 1995 Plan by 230,000 shares, with a
corresponding cancellation of a similar number of shares under the 1998 Employee Incentive
Compensation Plan the 1998 Plan. The shareholders approved this action on May6, 1999. On
December14, 2000, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a proposal to increase the number
of shares available under the 1998 Plan by 200,000 shares, from 740,000 to 940,000 shares. On May
23, 2001, the shareholders approved an amendment to the Companys 1995 Plan, as adopted by the
Board of Directors on January25, 2001, to increase the number of shares available under the Plan
by 275,000 shares, from 2,210,000 to 2,485,000. The aggregate number of shares of the Companys
Common Stock which may be issued under the 1995 Plan and the 1998 Plan is 2,485,000 and 940,000
shares, respectively, subject to proportionate adjustment in the event of stock splits and similar
events. On January24, 2002, the Board of Directors approved a proposal to increase the number of
shares available under the 1998 Plan by 50,000 shares, from 940,000 to 990,000 shares. That same
date, the Board also approved a proposal to increase the number of shares available under the 1995
Plan by 200,000. On May7, 2002, the shareholders approved an amendment to the 1995 Plan, as
adopted by the Board of Directors on January24, 2002, to increase the number of shares available
by 200,000 from 2,485,000 to 2,685,000. The maximum number of shares which may be awarded under
the 1995 Plan to any one Named Executive Officer during any calendar year of the life of the plan
is 200,000 shares. All full-time active employees of the Company, excluding officers and
directors, are eligible to participate in the 1998 Plan. Amendments to the 1998 Plan do not
require the approval of the shareholders, but are approved by the Board of Directors. The Company
has 2,061,767 total shares reserved under the option plans. The shares authorized but not granted
under these plans at December31, 2003 and 2004 were as follows

The fair value of the stock options used to compute pro forma net income and earnings per share
disclosures is the estimated present value at grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the following weighted average assumptions for 2002, 2003 and 2004: expected volatility
of 932% in 2002, 967% in 2003 and 718% in 2004; a risk-free interest rate of 267% in 2002,

SERIES A JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS In order to protect shareholder value in the event of an unsolicited offer to acquire the Company,
on July23, 1996, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend of one preferred stock
purchase right for each outstanding share of the Companys common stock. The dividend was payable
on August15, 1996 to shareholders of record as of that date. The aforementioned rights are
exercisable only if a person or group acquires or announces an offer to acquire 20% or more of the
Companys common stock. In such an event, each right will entitle shareholders to buy
one-hundredth of a share of a new series of preferred stock at an exercise price of $11500. Each
one-hundredth of a share of the new preferred stock has terms designed to make it the economic and
voting equivalent of one share of common stock. If a person or group acquires 20% or more of the Companys outstanding common stock, each right not
owned by the person or group will entitle its holder to purchase at the rights exercise price a
number of shares of the Companys common stock or, at the option of the Company, the new preferred
stock having a market value of twice the exercise price. Further, at any time after a person or
group acquires 20% or more but less than 50% of the outstanding common stock, the Board of
Directors may at its option, exchange part or all of the rights other than rights held by the
acquiring person or group for shares of the Companys common or preferred stock on a one-for-one
basis. Each right further provides that if the Company is acquired in a merger or other business
transaction, each right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the rights exercise price, a
number of the acquiring companys common shares having a market value at that time of twice the
exercise price. The Board of Directors is entitled to redeem the rights for one cent per right at any time before a
20% position has been acquired. The Board of Directors is also authorized to reduce the 20%
thresholds referred to above to not less than 10%. 7. LICENSE AND ROYALTY FEES The Company has entered into several technology license agreements with certain major Digital Loop
Carrier DLCvendors and major Operation Support System OSSequipment manufacturers under which
the Company has been granted access to the licensors patent technology and the right to
manufacture and sell the patent technology in the Companys product line. The Company is obligated
to pay royalty fees, as defined, through the terms of these license agreements. Under these
agreements, license and royalty fees are due only upon purchase of the technology or shipment of
units; there are no contingent payment provisions in any of these arrangements. Royalty fees of
$889,024, $966,715 and $1,187,500 were incurred in 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively, and are
included in cost of product sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 8. INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes consisted of the following 49 Table of Contents

The deferred tax asset from net operating loss carryforwards is largely attributed to
Pennsylvania which presently allows a 20-year carryforward with a $2,000,000 limit on deductions
each year. Unused carryforward losses will expire through 2021. During 2004, we recorded state net
operating loss carryforwards and a full valuation allowance related to Pennsylvania and New York
state net operating losses which resulted in a charge of $11.
million. Additionally, during 2004, we
reduced certain tax contingency reserves by $08million based on changes in estimates based on a
tax audit of certain earlier years and on an evaluation of current circumstances. The impact of
the change related to the state net operating loss carryforwards and state valuation allowances and
the reversal of certain tax
contingency reserves resulted in a net charge of $03million during 2004. The Company had a
federal taxable loss for 2004 and will be able to carry this loss back to 2002 to recover prior
year cash taxes paid of $06million. As of December31, 2003, we had recorded a valuation
allowance of $05million related to state net operating losses. 9. LINE OF CREDIT Effective December20, 2001, and amended effective February7, 2003, the Company executed a
five-year $25,000,000 Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility the Facility with a bank. In
accordance with the terms of the Facility, the proceeds must be used for general corporate
purposes, working capital needs, and in connection with certain acquisitions, as defined. The
Facility contains certain standard covenants with which the Company must comply, including a
minimum fixed charge ratio, a minimum defined level of tangible net worth and a restriction on the
amount of capital expenditures that can be made on an annual basis, among others. A maximum
leverage ratio restricts total borrowings of the Company to approximately $150million during the
first quarter of 2005. Interest is payable on any amounts utilized under the Facility at prime, or
the prevailing Euro rate plus 10% to 15% depending on the fixed charge coverage ratio, at the
option of the Company. Commitment fees are paid quarterly at the rate of 025% per annum on the
average unused commitment. At December31, 2004, there were no amounts outstanding under the
Facility. 10. COMMITMENTS and CONTINGENCIES The Company leases office space and equipment under agreements which are accounted for as operating
leases. The office lease for the Cheswick facility, the Bridgewater facility and the Sarasota
facility expire on December31, 2005, January21, 2007 and April28, 2008, respectively. The
Company is also involved in various month-to-month leases for research and development and office
equipment at all three locations. In addition, all three of the office leases include provisions
for possible adjustments in annual future rental commitments relating to excess taxes, excess
maintenance costs that may occur and increases in rent based on the consumer price index and based
on increases in our annual lease commitments, none of these commitments are material.
Additionally, the Company has arrangements with certain manufacturing subcontractors under which
the Company is contingently obligated to purchase up to $2,323,000 of raw material parts in the
event they would not be consumed by the manufacturing process in the normal course of business.
Approximately $996,000 of the total commitment of $2,323,000 has been recorded in the consolidated
balance sheet as the Company has a legal obligation to purchase this inventory as of December31,
2004. The recording of this obligation in the financial statements did not result in a change to
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We fully expect to utilize this inventory during the
normal course of business and have not recorded any reserve related to this specific item. Minimum annual future commitments as of December31 are

The lease expense for all commitments was $1,170,101, $1,479,754 and $1,571,982 in 2002, 2003 and
2004, respectively. The increase in rent expense from 2002 to 2003 related to the Cheetah
acquisition. The increase in 2003 compared to 2004 is related to having twelve months of lease
expense related to our Sarasota location. In addition, the Company is, from time to time, party to various legal claims and disputes, either
asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business. While the final resolution
of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that the outcome
of any of these claims will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial
position, or annual results of operations or cash flow. 11. MAJOR CUSTOMERS, REVENUE CONCENTRATION AND DEPENDENCE ON CERTAIN SUPPLIERS The Company designs, engineers, markets and supports test system, test access and status monitoring
products for the telecommunications and cable television industries. We have five product
categories which consist of our MCU products, DigiTest, LoopCare software, cable hardware and
software and services. Sales of our MCU product line were $211million, $254million and $281
million for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Sales of our DigiTest
product line were $77million, $66million and $83million for the years ended December31,
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Sales of stand-alone LoopCare software products were $44
million, $34million and $75million for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively. Sales of our cable hardware and software products were $167million, $174million,
and $31million for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Service
revenues were $130million, $123million, and $103million for the years ended December31,
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively Sales are concentrated primarily with the four Regional Bell 51 Table of Contents Operating Companies RBOCs as well as major independent telephone and cable companies and to
certain digital loop carrier equipment manufacturers. Sales are derived primarily from the
Companys metallic channel unit MCUproduct line which accounted for approximately 34% of the
Companys net sales for 2004. The cable television hardware and software product lines, which
include both CheetahLight formerly LIGHTHOUSE and the newly acquired CheetahNet lines,
contributed approximately 27% while DigiTest and LoopCare RTU sales accounted for approximately 12%
and 7%, respectively, of the Companys net sales for 2004. Revenue from Services, which includes
installation oversight and project management services provided to RBOCs and fees for LoopCare and
Cheetah software maintenance, accounted for approximately 21% of the Companys net sales for 2004. Sales to RBOC customers accounted for approximately 77%, 56%, and 54% of the Companys net product
sales for fiscal years 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. During 2002, 2003 and 2004, sales to
three RBOC customers individually exceeded 10% of consolidated revenues and, on a combined basis,
comprised 70% individually, 38%, 18% and 14%, 48% individually, 17%, 17% and 14% and 50%
individually, 20%, 15% and 15% of the Companys net product sales, respectively. Due to the
Companys
present dependency on RBOC customers, the loss of one or more of the RBOCs as a customer, or the
reduction of orders for the Companys products by the RBOCs, could materially and adversely affect
the Company. The Company utilizes three key independent subcontractors to perform a majority of the circuit
board assembly and in-circuit testing work on its products. The Company also utilizes other
subassembly contractors on a more limited basis. The loss of the subcontractors could cause delays
in the Companys ability to meet production obligations and could have a material adverse effect on
the Companys results of operations. In addition, shortages of raw material or production capacity
constraints at the Companys subcontractors could negatively affect the Companys ability to meet
its production obligations and result in increased prices for affected parts. Any such reduction
may result in delays in shipments of the Companys products or increases in the price of
components, either of which could have a material adverse impact on the Company. 12. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company has a 401k benefit plan. Eligible employees, as defined in the plan, may contribute
up to 20% of eligible compensation, not to exceed the statutory limit. The Company does not make
matching contributions to the plan. 13. SEVERANCE AND RELATED EXPENSE On July8, 2004 and July21, 2004, the Company announced a cost alignment program which eliminated,
in two phases, approximately 50 positions. The majority of the reductions impacted the research
and development, manufacturing, and related overhead areas of the Company. The cost alignment
initiative resulted in a pre-tax severance expense of $268,637. All costs associated with the
program were incurred and paid during the quarter ended September25, 2004. Therefore, no
remaining obligations exist at the end of the period. On September30, 2002, the Company announced
a cost reduction initiative which included the elimination of 47 positions, primarily in research
and development. The restructuring program resulted in a pre-tax charge for severance,
outplacement and other related costs of $175,723 in 2002. All amounts for the 2002 program were
paid during 2002. 14. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In January2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB FASB issued FASB Interpretations
No46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting
Research Bulletin No51. FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated
by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the
characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for
the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other
parties. FIN 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after
January31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February1, 2003,
the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after
December15, 2003. The adoption of this standard had no impact on our financial condition or
results of operations. In March2004, the FASB approved Emerging Issues Task Force EITFIssue No03-1, The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. The objective of this
issue is to provide guidance for identifying other-than-temporarily impaired investments. EITF No.
03-1 also provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily
impaired. In September2004, the FASB issued EITF No03-1-1, which delayed the effective date of
EITF No03-1, with the exception of certain disclosure requirements. We do not believe that EITF
No03-1 will have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations. In November2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No151 SFAC 151,
Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No43, Chapter4. This statement amends the guidance in
ARB No43 Chapter4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material spoilage. Paragraph5 of ARB 43,
Chapter4, previously stated that..under some circumstances, items such as idle facility expense,
excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal to require treatment as
a current period charges. This statement requires that those items be recognized as current-period
charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal. In addition, this
statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be
based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of this statement will
be effective for inventory costs during the fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005. We do not
believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its financial condition
or results of operations. In December2004, the
FASB issued Statement No123R, Shared-Based Payment. Statement 123R
requires the measurement of all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method
as of the grant date and recording such expense in the consolidated financial statements. In
addition, the adoption of Statement 123R will require additional accounting related to the income
tax effects and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from share-based
payment arrangements. 52 Table of Contents Statement 123R is effective beginning in our third quarter of fiscal 2005.
We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of Statement 123R. In December2004, the FASB issued Statement No153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment
of APB Opinion No29. Statement 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets
and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the
assets exchanged. Statement 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal
periods beginning after June15, 2005. We do not believe adoption of Statement 153 will have a
material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No.FAS109-1 FAS 109-1, Application of
FASB Statement No109. Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production
Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The AJCA introduces a special 9%
tax deduction on qualified production activities. FAS 109-1 clarifies that this tax
deduction should be accounted for as a special tax deduction in accordance with Statement 109. We
do not expect the adoption of these new tax provisions to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No FAS 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure
Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004. The American Jobs Creation Act introduces a special one-time dividends received deduction on
the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer repatriation provision, provided
certain criteria are met. FSP FAS 109-2 provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the
repatriation provision. We do not believe the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 nor the FASB Staff Position will have a material impact on our
financial condition or results of operations. 15. SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS The estimated fair values of the Companys financial instruments are as follows

Item5. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of December31, 2004, the Company has carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of,
and with the participation of, the Companys management, including the Companys chief executive
officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Companys disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule13a-15 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and principal
financial officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits
under Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified by the SECs rules and forms. Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule
13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the quarter ended December31, 2004
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control
over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rule13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2004. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework. Our management has concluded that, as of December31, 2004, our
internal control over financial reporting was effective based on these criteria. Our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, has audited
our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004 as
stated in their report, which is included herein. 55 Table of Contents PART III
