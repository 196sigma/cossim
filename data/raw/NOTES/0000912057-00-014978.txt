ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
See the Index to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth on page 33.
QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS
The following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial data
for 1998 and 1999. In the opinion of management, the unaudited quarterly
information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated
financial statements and includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal
recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the information
for the periods presented. The quarterly operating results are not necessarily
indicative of results of operations for any future period.
Our merger with FutureTense in October 1999 was accounted for as a pooling
of interests, and accordingly, all prior period financial data have been
restated as if the merger took place at the beginning of such periods.                                      THREE MONTHS ENDED

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Open Market, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Open
Market, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999
and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of operations, redeemable
convertible preferred stock and stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We did not audit the 1998 and 1997 financial statements of
FutureTense, Inc., a company acquired during 1999 in a transaction accounted for
as a pooling of interests, as discussed in Note 4a. Such financial statements
are included in the consolidated financial statements of Open Market, Inc. and
reflect total assets of 4% in 1998 and total revenues of 4% and 0% in 1998 and
1997, respectively. These statements were audited by other auditors whose report
has been furnished to us and our opinion, insofar as it relates to amounts
included for FutureTense, Inc., is based solely upon the report of the other
auditors.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of the other
auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of the other auditors, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Open Market, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

1 OPERATIONS
Open Market, Inc. Open Market or the Company offers an integrated
suite of e-business software products and services that enable our customers to
manage and deliver online content, and engage in personalized online marketing.
The integrated e-business application suite is built on an open standards-based
architecture that is scalable and easily adaptable to the evolving business
through a broad range of media, including Web browsers and cell phones, personal
digital assistants and other wireless devices. The Company currently offers
three principal products: Internet Publishing System, the integrated publishing
system that provides content management and dynamic delivery of personalized
information: Transact, our comprehensive order management and transaction
processing system: and Shopsite, our web storefront building software for small
to medium businesses.
The Company is subject to risks common to growing technology-based
companies, including a history of significant losses, operating results are
largely dependent upon continued development and growth of Internet commerce,
lengthy sales cycles, dependence on systems integrators, competition,
fluctuations in quarterly operating results, managing rapid expansion,
international operations, product defects, integration of FutureTense
acquisition, dependence on intellectual property, potential intellectual
property rights infringements and threat of product defects.
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application
of the following significant accounting policies described in this note and
elsewhere in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
A PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, which includes
FutureTense, Inc., for all periods presented. All material intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
B REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Statement of Position
SOP 97-2, SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION, as amended by SOP 98-4. Additionally,
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants recently issued SOP 98-9,
which provides for certain amendments to SOP 97-2, which is effective for
transactions entered into beginning January 1, 2000. This pronouncement is not
expected to materially impact the Company revenue recognition practices. The
Company generates revenues from two sources: license fees for the use of our
products and service revenues for implementation, support, consulting and
training related to our products.
The Company executes separate contracts that govern the terms and conditions
of each software license and maintenance arrangement and each professional
services arrangement. These contracts may be an element in a multiple element
arrangement. Revenues under multiple element arrangements, which may include
several different software products or services sold together, are allocated to
each element based on the residual method in accordance with Statement of
Position 98-9, SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION, WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN
ARRANGEMENTS.
The Company uses the residual method when fair value does not exist for one
of the delivered elements in an arrangement. Under the residual method, the fair
value of the undelivered elements is
41
OPEN MARKET, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
deferred and subsequently recognized. The Company has established sufficient
vendor specific objective evidence for the value of professional services,
training and maintenance and support services based on the price charged when
these elements are sold separately. Accordingly, software license revenue is
recognized under the residual method in arrangements in which software is
licensed with professional services, training and maintenance and support
services.
Revenues from software license agreements are recognized upon delivery of
the software if there is evidence of an agreement, there are no significant
post-delivery obligations, and the payment is fixed or determinable and
collection is probable. If an acceptance period is required, revenues are
recognized upon customer acceptance. The Company enters into reseller
arrangements for certain products that typically provide for sublicense fees
payable to the Company based on a percentage of the Company list price.
Royalty and sublicense revenues from the Company reseller arrangements are
recognized when earned, either on a per-unit basis as reported to the Company by
its licensees, or, with regards to guaranteed minimums, upon shipment of the
master copy of all software to which the guaranteed minimum sublicense fees
relate, if there are no significant post-delivery obligations. Revenues for
post-contract customer support are recognized ratably over the term of the
support period, which is typically one year. Service revenues, which includes
education, implementation and consulting services, are recognized in the period
services are provided, if customer acceptance is not required, there is evidence
of an agreement, the revenues are fixed or determinable and collection is
probable.
Cost of product revenues consists of costs to distribute the product,
including the cost of the media on which it is delivered and royalty payments to
third-party vendors. Cost of service revenues consists primarily of consulting
and support personnel salaries and related costs.
Deferred revenues represent cash received from customers for products and
services in advance of revenue recognition.
C CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The Company accounts for investments under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 115, ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY
SECURITIES. Under SFAS No. 115, investments for which the Company has the
positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, consisting of cash equivalents
and marketable securities, are reported at amortized cost, which approximates
fair market value. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original
maturities of less than three months. Marketable securities are investment-grade
securities with original maturities of greater than three months. The average
maturity of the Company marketable securities was approximately five months at
December 31                    42

The Company has evaluated the establishment of technological feasibility of
its products in accordance with SFAS No. 86, ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF
COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED OR OTHERWISE MARKETED. The Company sells
products in a market that is subject to rapid technological change, new product
development and changing customer needs; accordingly, the Company has concluded
that technological feasibility is not established until the development stage of
the product is nearly complete. The Company defines technological feasibility as
the completion of a working model. The time period during which costs could be
capitalized, from the point of reaching technological feasibility until the time
of general product release, is very short, and consequently, the amounts that
could be capitalized are not material to the Company financial position or
results of operations. Therefore, the Company has charged all such costs to
research and development in the period incurred.

F TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES
The accounts of the Company foreign subsidiaries are translated in
accordance with SFAS No. 52, FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. In translating the
accounts of the foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars, assets and liabilities
are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at year-end, while
stockholders' equity is translated at historical rates. Revenue and expense
accounts are translated using the weighted average rate in effect during the
year. Foreign currency translation and transaction gains or losses for the
foreign subsidiary are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations since the functional currency of these subsidiaries is the U.S.
dollar. The Company had accounts receivable of approximately $1,036 and $944
denominated in foreign currencies as of December 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. The Company marks these receivables to market and records a gain
or loss, which is a component of other income/expense in the consolidated
statements of operations. The Company has not incurred a significant loss to
date.
G NET LOSS PER SHARE
The Company applies SFAS No. 128, EARNINGS PER SHARE. SFAS No. 128
establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share and
applies to entities with publicly held common stock or potential common stock.
The Company has applied the provisions of SFAS No. 128 and Staff Accounting
Bulletin SAB No. 98 for all periods presented. Net loss per share is based
upon the weighted average outstanding shares of common stock, adjusted to give
effect to the number of equivalent shares of Open Market common stock issued in
connection with the FutureTense acquisition for all periods presented. Diluted
net loss per share for the years ended 1999, 1998 and 1997 is the same as basic
net loss per share as the inclusion of the potential common stock equivalents
would be antidilutive. The number of outstanding antidilutive potential common
stock, consist of warrants, shares held in escrow from the FutureTense
acquisition and stock options totaling 8,259, 6,622 and 6,741 for the years
ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
H CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
SFAS No. 105, DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ABOUT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH
OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT
RISK, requires disclosure of any significant off-balance-sheet risk and credit
risk concentrations. The Company has no significant off-balance-sheet risk or
credit risk concentrations. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents
with several financial institutions and invests in investment-grade securities.
The Company did not have any customers with revenues greater than 10% of total
revenues in the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 or accounts
receivable balances greater than 10% of total accounts receivable as of
December 31, 1999 and 1998.
I POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Company has no obligations for postretirement benefits.
J FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The estimated fair values of the Company financial instruments, which
include cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, line of credit, long-term debt and obligations and redeemable
convertible preferred stock approximate their carrying value.

K USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements
required the use of certain estimates by management in determining the Company
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
L RECLASSIFICATIONS
The Company has reclassified certain prior year information to conform with
current year presentation.
M COMPREHENSIVE LOSS
SFAS No. 130, REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, requires disclosure of all
components of comprehensive loss on an annual and interim basis. Comprehensive
loss is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period
from transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner sources. The
Company comprehensive loss is the same as the reported net loss for all
periods presented.
N DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE
The Company applies SFAS No. 131, DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN
ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION which establishes standards for reporting
information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and
requires selected information for those segments to be presented in interim
financial reports issued to stockholders. SFAS No. 131 also establishes
standards for related disclosures about products and services and geographic
areas. Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about
which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the
chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in making decisions on
how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company chief
decision-maker, as defined under SFAS No. 131, is a combination of the Chief
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.
The Company has three reportable operating segments 1 commerce management,
including the licensing of Transact, LiveCommerce and ShopSite products,
2 content management, including the licensing of Internet Publishing System
and 3 other, which includes the publishing product suite and

1998 and 1997 were shipped from its facilities located in the United States. As
of December 31, 1999 and 1998 all of the Company assets relate to the
e-business segment, except for $10,173 and $25,439, respectively which are
attributable to the other product revenue segment. Substantially, all of the
Company long lived assets are located in the United States.
O LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets based on the
guidance in SFAS No. 121, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND
FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF. The
46
OPEN MARKET, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Company evaluation considers strategy, competitive information, market trends
and operating performance. Based on its evaluation at December 31, 1999, the
Company does not believe any impairment of long-lived assets exists.
P NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The Securities and Exchange Commission issued SAB No. 101, REVENUE
RECOGNITION, in December 1999. The Company is required to adopt this new
accounting guidance through a cumulative charge to operations, in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No. 20, ACCOUNTING CHANGES, no
later than the second quarter of fiscal 2000. The Company believes that the
adoption of the guidance provided in SAB No. 101 will not have a material impact
on future operating results.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES. This
statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities, SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS
No. 137, is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2000. SFAS No. 133 is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company consolidated financial statements.
3 SPECIAL CHARGES
A RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company implemented a restructuring plan
to better align its operating costs with its anticipated future revenue stream.
The major component of the restructuring charge related to the elimination of
approximately 67 employees across the following functions: research and
development 27, marketing 17, general and administrative 22 and services
1. In addition, 10 employees moved from research and development to services.
Other components related to settling certain contractual arrangements for
porting and product integration that resulted from a change in product strategy.
Other charges included the write-off of unutilized software, originally intended
for use by the sales force but not implemented due to the reduction in marketing
personnel. The total cash impact of the restructuring amounted to approximately
$1,748. All liabilities were paid as of December 31, 1999. Following are the

into employment agreements in 1998 with certain key employees of ICentral under
which the Company agreed to pay bonuses in an aggregate amount of $1,000,
depending on certain future events, as defined. The employees earned $609 under

capital stock of Waypoint Software Corporation Waypoint, a software
development company specializing in the business-to-business industrial catalog
segment of the Internet. As payment of the purchase price, the Company issued an
aggregate of approximately 739,000 shares of its common stock to the

shares of the Company common stock at $0456 per share to Waypoint option

common stock issued in connection with the acquisition was approximately $11,000
based on a weighted average market price, as defined, of the Company freely
tradable shares. The shares issued were subject to certain selling restrictions
and, as a result, were not freely tradable. Therefore, for purposes of
calculating aggregate consideration paid, the value of the shares issued was
recorded at a discounted value. In addition, in connection with this
acquisition, the Company has entered into employment agreements with certain of
the principals of Waypoint under which the Company has agreed to pay bonuses in
an aggregate amount of $1,200 over two years depending on certain future events,
as defined. The total bonus amounts were paid as of February 1999. For financial

D FOLIO CORPORATION
Pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of February 20, 1997 the
Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares
of capital stock of Folio Corporation Folio, a leading supplier of software
for managing business-critical information from Reed Elsevier. As payment of the
purchase price, the Company i issued 897,866 shares of common stock of the
Company, ii made a cash payment of $10,000, iii agreed to issue 897,866
shares of common stock of the Company in January 1998 and iv issued a
promissory note of the Company in the original principal amount of $10,000
payable in either cash or a combination of cash and common stock of the Company.
See Note 6b The value of the shares of common stock of the Company issued or
reserved for issuance was approximately $25,000, based on a weighted average
market price, as defined, of the Company freely tradable shares. The shares of
common stock issued in March 1997 and in January 1998 were not freely tradable
due to selling restrictions. Therefore, for purposes of calculating the
aggregate consideration paid, the value of such shares was recorded at a
discounted value at the time of issuance. The Stock Purchase Agreement provided
for a purchase price adjustment based on the change in the net assets of Folio
from the estimated value at December 31, 1996, through the date of closing. As a
result of this adjustment, the former stockholder of Folio forfeited 270,116
shares of common stock of the Company to be issued in the transaction.
Additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated statements of
stockholders' equity included the value of the shares to be issued in
January 1998, net of the forfeited shares. The Company repaid $5,000 of the note
payable issued to Reed Elsevier in 1997 in connection with the Folio acquisition
with a $1,818 cash payment and $3,182 of common stock. The Company repaid the
remaining $5,000 note payable in cash in March 1999. For financial statement
purposes, this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase, and accordingly, the
results of operations of Folio subsequent to March 7, 1997, are included in the
Company consolidated statements of operations. For tax purposes, this
transaction will be treated as a deemed asset purchase in accordance with the
Internal Revenue Code Section 338h10.

The Company accounts for income taxes under SFAS No. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR
INCOME TAXES, the objective of which is to recognize the amount of current and
deferred income taxes payable or refundable at the date of the financial
statements as a result of all events that have been recognized in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements, as measured by enacted tax laws.
The provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998
and 1997 consists of foreign income and withholding taxes.
At December 31, 1999, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for
federal income tax purposes of approximately $119,000, which expire through
2006 - 2019. The Company also has certain tax credits available to offset future
federal and state income taxes, if any. Net operating loss carryforwards and
credits are subject to review and possible adjustments by the Internal Revenue
Service and may be limited in the event of certain cumulative changes in excess
of 50% in the ownership interests of significant stockholders over a three-year
period. The Company believes it has experienced a change in ownership in excess
of 50%. The Company does not believe that this change in ownership will
significantly impact the Company ability to utilize its net operating loss
carryforwards.

It is the Company objective to become a profitable enterprise and to
realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets. However, in evaluating the
realizability of these deferred tax assets, management has considered the
Company operating history, the volatility of the market in which it competes,
the operating losses incurred to date, and believes that given the significance
of this evidence, a full valuation reserve against its deferred tax assets is
required as of December 31, 1999 and 1998.

D STOCKHOLDERS' RIGHTS
In January 1998, the Company Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder
Protection Rights Plan declaring a dividend of one right for each share of the
Company common stock outstanding at the close of business on February 12,
1998. The rights entitle the Company shareholders to purchase one
one-thousandth of a share of a series of junior participating preferred stock of
the Company at an exercise price of $6500 per share. The rights become
exercisable in the event that another party acquires or announces its intention
to acquire beneficial ownership of 18% or more of the Company common stock.
Such percentage may, at the Board discretion, be lowered, although in no event
may it be lower than 10%. In the event of such an acquisition or similar event,
each right, except those owned by the acquirer, will enable the holder of the
right to purchase that number of common shares of the Company which equals the
exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the market price of the
common stock. In addition, if the Company is involved in a merger or other
transaction with another party in which it is not the surviving corporation, or
it sells or transfers 50% or more of its assets or earning power to another
party, each right will entitle its holder to purchase that number of shares of
common stock of the other party which equals the exercise price of the right
divided by one-half of the market price of such common stock. The rights expire
ten years from the date of the grant.

of FutureTense who was a party to a Restriction Agreement, FutureTense
repurchased 268,800 shares of unvested common stock for $20. A compensation
charge of $19 was recorded for the difference between the original cost and the
repurchase price.

The Company recorded deferred compensation when stock options were granted
to employees at an exercise price per share that is less than the fair market
value on the date of the grant. Deferred compensation was recorded in an amount
equal to the excess of the fair market value per share over the exercise price
multiplied by the number of shares purchasable under the option. The Company
recorded $399, $41 and $138 of deferred compensation expense in 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively, which represented the difference betweeen the fair market
value of the common stock on the date of grant, for accounting purposes, and the
exercise price.
In November 1998, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
authorized a Stock Option Exchange Program the Program. Under the terms of the
program all current employees, excluding certain officers subject to

options and replace them with a new option. Options for a total of 2,258,153
shares were surrendered under the program by employees and exchanged for new
options at the new option exercise price and vesting schedule. The new exercise
price was equal to the fair market value of the Company common stock on
November 13, 1998, or $7875. The repriced shares were subject to certain
selling restrictions though 1999. These repriced options are reflected as grants
and cancellations in the 1998 stock option activity below.

H PRO FORMA DISCLOSURE OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
SFAS No. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, requires the
measurement of the fair value of stock options or warrants granted to employees
to be included in the statement of operations or, alternatively, disclosed in
the notes to consolidated financial statements. The Company has determined that
it will continue to account for stock-based compensation for employees under
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and elect the disclosure-only
alternative under SFAS No. 123. The Company records the fair market value of
stock options and warrants granted to nonemployees in the consolidated statement
of operations. The Company has computed the pro forma disclosures required under

No. 123 for stock options granted in 1999, 1998 and 1997 using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. The weighted average assumptions used for 1999, 1998 and
1997 are as follows                            1999    1998    1997
Risk-free interest   596%   491%   688%
Expected dividend     --     --     Expected  6 years  6 years  7 years
Expected    103%    108%    70   The total value of the options granted to employees and stock issued under
the employee stock purchase plan during 1999, 1998 and 1997 was computed as
approximately $49,664, $32,320 and $16,962, respectively. Of these amounts
approximately $17,114, $7,870 and $8,924 would be charged to operations for the
years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The remaining
amount, approximately $36,594, would be amortized over the remaining vesting
periods. The pro forma effect of these option grants for the years ended
December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 is as follows                          1999    1998    1997
Net loss, as  $19,780 $36,970 $62,460

Net loss per share--basic and diluted
As  $ 046 $ 098 $ 187
Pro  $ 086 $ 119 $ 214
The resulting pro forma compensation expense may not be representative of
the amount to be expected in future years as the pro forma expense may vary
based upon the number of options granted. The Black-Scholes option pricing model
was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have
no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option pricing
models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected
stock price volatility. Because the Company employee stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value
estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock
options.
