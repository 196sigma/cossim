Notes to Consolidated Financial                     34       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of A.C. Moore Arts & Crafts, Inc. We have completed integrated audits of A.C. Moore Arts & Crafts, Inc. December
31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, and an audit
of its December 31, 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements
- 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of A.C.
Moore Arts & Crafts, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and December
31, 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal control over financial reporting
- 
Also, in our opinion, management assessment, included in Management Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those
criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
issued by the COSO. The Company management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.                    35 A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; ii
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization and basis of presentation. A.C. Moore Arts & Crafts, Inc. became a
holding company in July 1997 by incorporating in Pennsylvania and exchanging its
common stock for all of the capital stock of A.C. Moore Inc. held by its
shareholders. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of A.C.
Moore Arts & Crafts, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries collectively the
Company. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As
of December 31, 2005, the Company operated a 109-store chain of retail arts and
crafts stores in the eastern region of the United States.
Use of estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the amount
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Differences from those
estimates, if any, are recorded in the period they become known.
Cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which
approximates market value. Cash equivalents include only securities having an
original maturity of three months or less.
Concentration of credit risk. Financial instruments, which potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk, are cash and cash equivalents. The
Company limits its credit risk by placing its investments in highly rated,
highly liquid funds.
Inventories. Inventories, which consist of general consumer merchandise held for
sale, are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of store inventories
is determined by the retail inventory method. Warehouse inventories are
determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company includes as inventoriable
costs certain indirect costs, such as purchasing and receiving costs, inbound
freight, duties related to import purchases, internal transfer costs and
warehousing costs.
Marketable Securities. Marketable securities represent investments in municipal
bonds with maturities of three months or longer from time of purchase. They are
classified as held-to-maturity and recorded at amortized cost.
Property and equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost. In
constructing the new distribution center, the Company capitalized interest in
the amount of $202,000. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over
the estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings are depreciated over 40
years and building improvements are depreciated principally over 20 years.
Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated over periods of five to ten
years and leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their
estimated useful lives or the original term of the related lease. Maintenance
and repairs are charged to operations as incurred and major improvements are
capitalized. Amortization of assets recorded under capital leases is included in
depreciation expense.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company reviews
long-lived assets for impairment by comparing the carrying value of assets with
their estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If it is determined that an
impairment loss has occurred, the loss would be recognized during that period.
The impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying values
of the asset and the present value of estimated net cash flows or comparable
market values, giving consideration to recent operating performance and pricing
trends. The Company had no impairment losses related to long-lived assets during
2005, 2004 or 2003.                    41 The Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with developing or
obtaining internal use software in accordance with Statement of Position SOP
98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use. These capitalized software costs are included in Property and
Equipment, net in the consolidated balance sheets. These costs are being
amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, not to exceed five
years.
Other Assets. Includes amounts to obtain store leases. These amounts are being
amortized over the life of the original lease.
Revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue at the time of sale of
merchandise to its customers. The value of point of sale coupons, which have a
very limited life, and other discounts that result in a reduction of the price
paid by the customer are recorded as a reduction of sales. Sales returns, which
are reserved for based on historical experience, are provided for in the period
that the related sales are recorded. Proceeds from the sale of gift cards are
recorded as gift card liabilities and recognized as revenue when redeemed by the
holder.
Lease Accounting. The Company commences accounting for store leases on the date
they take possession of the leased space. Landlord allowances and incentives are
recorded as deferred rent liabilities and are amortized as a reduction of rent
expense over the initial term of the lease, commencing with the date of
possession.
Store pre-opening expenses. Direct incremental costs incurred to prepare a store
for opening, including straight-line rent expense, are charged to expense as
incurred.
Advertising costs. The costs incurred for advertising are expensed the first
time the advertising takes place and are offset by reimbursements received under
cooperative advertising programs with certain vendors. Co-op advertising funds
are only recognized when we have performed our contractual obligations under a
co-op advertising agreement. Advertising expense before the consideration of
cooperative advertising allowances was $298 million, $239 million and $204
million for 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively, and is included in selling,
general, and administrative expense.
Fair value of financial instruments. The carrying amounts of cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, other current
assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate
fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The Company
invests cash balances in excess of operating requirements primarily in money
market mutual funds and to a lesser extent in interest-bearing securities with
maturities of less than two years. The fair value of the Company cash and
equivalents at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 approximated carrying
value. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit at
December 31, 2005 or December 31, 2004. The interest rates on the Company
mortgages fluctuate with market rates and therefore the value of these financial
instruments will not be impacted by a change in interest rates. Based on the
amounts existing at December 31, 2005, the impact of a hypothetical increase or
decrease in interest rates of 10% compared with the rates in effect at December
31, 2005 would result in an increase or decrease in the Company interest
expense of $143,000 annually, and an increase or decrease in the Company
interest income of $183,000 annually.
Stock option plan. The Company accounts for its employee stock options using the
intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25. Compensation cost for stock
options is measured as the excess of the quoted market price of the Company
stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the
stock. No stock-based employee compensation has been included in the
determination of net income.                    42 Had compensation cost for the Company stock-based compensation plan been
determined based on the fair value at the grant date for awards under those
plans, consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, net income and earnings per share would have been
reduced to the following pro forma amounts                                     2005      2004       2003

The pro forma results may not be representative of the effects on reported
operations for future years. The fair value of the options was calculated using
a Black-Scholes options pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions                                 2005      2004     2003     2002

FASB Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payment FAS 123R. FAS 123R revised
FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation FAS 123 and
requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other
forms of stock-based compensation. Companies must adopt FAS 123R no later than
the beginning of their next fiscal year that begins after June 15, 2005. The
Company adopted FAS 123R in its first quarter of 2006.
Previously, in complying with FAS 123, the Company disclosed the value of stock
options granted and its pro forma impact on its net income in a footnote to its
financial statements. Information contained in the Company footnotes provides
the impact on pro forma net income for past financial statements. The Company
adopted the modified prospective application of implementing FAS 123R.
Income Taxes. The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes. The Company does business in various jurisdictions that impose
income taxes. Management determines the aggregate amount of income tax expense
to accrue and the amount currently payable based upon the tax statutes of each
jurisdiction. This process includes adjusting income determined using generally
accepted accounting principles for items that are treated differently by the
applicable taxing authorities. Deferred tax liabilities are reflected on the
Company balance sheet for temporary differences that will reverse in
subsequent years.                    43 2.    CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE
For all vendor contracts entered into or modified after December 31, 2002, the
Company has adopted the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 02-16, Accounting by a
Customer including a Reseller for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor.
EITF 02-16 addresses the accounting for cash consideration received by a
customer from a vendor e.g., slotting fees, cooperative advertising payments,
buydowns and rebates or refunds from a vendor that is payable only if the
customer completes a specified cumulative level of purchases or remains a
customer for a specified time period. The change in accounting means that vendor
monies which support the Company advertising programs are now being recorded
as a reduction in the cost of inventory, and are recognized as a reduction of
cost of goods sold when the inventory is sold. Previously, they were accounted
for as an offset to advertising costs. This accounting change results in a
timing difference as to when these monies are recognized in the Company income
statement. The adoption of EITF 02-16 reduced the Company 2005 net income by
$13 million or $007 per share. In 2005, the change increased gross margin by
$167 million, increased selling, general and administrative costs by $187
million, and decreased inventory by $20 million. In 2004 net income was reduced
by $34 million, $017 per share, gross margin increased by $119 million,
selling, general and administrative costs increased by $174 million and
inventory decreased by $55 million. In 2003 the Company recorded vendor
advertising support as a reduction of selling general and administrative
expenses in the amount of $136 million.

6.    FINANCING AGREEMENT
We maintain two mortgage agreements with Wachovia Bank on our new corporate
offices and distribution center of which $268 million was outstanding at
December 31, 2005. The mortgages are secured by land, building and equipment. Of
the original $300 million in mortgages, $225 million $206 million as of
December 31, 2005 is repayable over 15 years and $75 million $62 million as
of December 31, 2005 is repayable over 7 years. Fixed monthly payments totaling
$214,000 started in October 2004. The mortgages bear interest at rates that will
vary between LIBOR plus 85 basis points and LIBOR plus 135 basis points,
depending on the debt service coverage ratio and the length of the mortgage
payment. At December 31, 2005, LIBOR was 44%. We have the option of fixing the
interest rate at any time. The mortgages contain covenants that, among other
things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or guarantee
obligations in excess of $80 million, engage in mergers or consolidations,
dispose of assets, make acquisitions requiring a cash outlay in excess of $100
million, make loans or advances in excess of $10 million, or change the nature
of our business. We are restricted in capital expenditures, paying dividends and
making other distributions unless certain financial covenants are maintained
including those relating to tangible net worth, funded debt and a current ratio.
The mortgages also define various events of default, including cross default
provisions, defaults for any material judgments or a change in control. At
December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with these agreements.
At December 31, 2005 we had a $250 million line of credit agreement with
Wachovia Bank, which expired on May 1, 2006. Borrowing under this line will bear
interest at LIBOR plus 95 basis points and is subject to the same covenants as
the mortgages described above. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were no
borrowings outstanding under this agreement. On February 22, 2006, we amended
our line of credit agreement to increase the aggregate amount available from
$250 million to $350 million and to extend the expiration date from May 1,
2006 to May 31, 2007.                    45 7.    INCOME TAXES
