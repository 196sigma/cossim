The Board of Directors and Shareholders
HIE, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HIE, Inc.
formerly Healthdyne Information Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 1998. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of HIE, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

recognition.
The Company established business relationships with several new
distributors in 1998 and 1997 and therefore, limited historical data
is available on which to base estimates of future returns, allowances
and warranties. Management of the Company has provided an allowance
for expected returns, allowances and warranties based on historical
rates. The amounts of returns, allowances and warranties ultimately
incurred could differ materially in the near term from the allowances
calculated.
e Purchased Software
Purchased software includes the cost of purchased integration
software tools and the cost of software acquired in connection with
business combinations. It also includes the cost of licenses to use,
embed and sell software tools developed by others. These costs are
being amortized ratably based on the projected revenue associated
with these purchased or licensed tools and products or the
straight-line method over five years, whichever method results in a
higher level of annual amortization. Amortization expense related to
purchased software amounted to $563, $886 and $620 in 1998, 1997 and
1996, respectively. Accumulated amortization related to purchased
software totaled $1,341 and $778 at December 31, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. See notes 1k and 3.
f Research and Development and Capitalized Software Development Costs
Prior to the determination of technological feasibility for software
tools, research and development costs are expensed as incurred. After
determination of technological feasibility and before the release of
the software tools for general availability, the development costs
related to such tools are capitalized. These costs are being
amortized ratably based on the projected revenue associated with
these tools or the straight-line method over five years, whichever
method results in a higher level of annual amortization. The Company
capitalized $1,249, $467 and $789 of software development costs in
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Amortization expense related to
capitalized software development costs was $207, $101 and $39 in
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Accumulated amortization related
to capitalized software development costs totaled $329 and $122 at
December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. See note 1k.

h Excess of Cost Over Net Assets of Businesses Acquired
The excess of cost over net assets of businesses acquired goodwill
is being amortized using the straight-line method over 15 years.
Amortization expense related to acquired businesses amounted to $672,
$672, and $682 in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. At each balance
sheet date, the Company assesses the recoverability of this
intangible asset by determining whether the amortization of the
goodwill balance over its remaining life can be recovered through
undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired operation.
The amount of goodwill impairment, if any, is measured based on
projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount
rate reflecting the Company average cost of funds. Accumulated
amortization related to goodwill totaled $2,611 and $1,939 at
December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. See note 3.
i Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of
The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed of. This statement requires that long-lived
assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash
flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are
considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets
exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are
reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs
to sell.
j Stock Option Plans
Prior to January 1, 1996, the Company accounted for its stock option
plans in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles
Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations. As such, compensation expense
to be recognized over the related vesting period would generally be
determined on the date of grant only if the current market price of
the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price. On January 1, 1996,
the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123, which
permits entities to recognize as expense over the vesting period the
fair value of all stock-based awards on the date of grant.
Alternatively, SFAS 123 also allows entities to continue to apply the
provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and provide pro forma net earnings
loss and pro forma earnings loss per share disclosures for
employee stock option grants as if the fair-value-based method                    F-9

business direction stated in note 1 a above.
In connection with the acquisition of Criterion Health Strategies,
Inc. during 1997, the Company recorded a non-recurring charge related
to purchased in-process research and development costs for
integration software tools. The amount of the non-recurring charge
was equal to the estimated current fair value of specifically
identified technologies for which technological feasibility had not
yet been established pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 86, Accounting for Costs of Computer Software to be
Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed and for which future alternative
uses did not exist at the time of acquisition see note 3.
l Income Taxes

m Net Earnings Loss Per Share of Common Stock
On December 31, 1997, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share SFAS 128, which
prescribes the calculation methodology and financial reporting
requirements for basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings
loss per common share available to common shareholders are based on
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted
earnings loss per common share available to common shareholders are
based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and
dilutive potential common shares, such as dilutive stock options,
determined using the treasury stock method.
n Operating Segments
On January 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information. During 1998, the Company operated
in two segments: i the licensing of integration software products
and performance of related integration services and ii the
providing of consulting services related to information systems
integration for healthcare organizations see note 13.
o Comprehensive Income
On January 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial

Matria Healthcare, Inc. Matria, which was formed in a merger
involving Healthdyne in March 1996, provides certain legal, tax, data
processing, personnel and accounting services to the Company. Amounts
charged to the Company related to such services, which have been
reflected as general and administrative expenses in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations, were $10, $13, and $51 in 1998,
1997 and 1996, respectively. Charges for services provided by Matria to
the Company are generally determined based on estimates of actual time in
providing such services to the Company using actual costs without markup.
To the extent that charges for such services and for costs incurred by
Matria on the Company behalf are allocations of common expenses, such
allocations are based on one or more criteria such as asset or revenue
size, relative transaction volume, employee headcounts, facility size and
other relevant criteria. The Company believes that such allocation
methods result in reasonable approximations of the common expenses
related to the Company.
3  Acquisitions and Dispositions
Integrated Services Group
On December 31, 1998, the Company disposed of assets comprising of its
Integrated Services Group ISG to Superior Consulting Company, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Superior Consultant Holdings Corporation, in
exchange for cash of $22 million, of which $650 is held in escrow until
certain conditions are met. ISG provides consulting services related to
information systems integration for healthcare organizations. ISG
comprised approximately 123% of the Company revenue in 1998 see note
13. There was no gain or loss resulting from this disposal.
HUBLink, Inc.
In May, 1998, the Company issued 29 million shares of its common stock
in exchange for all outstanding common stock of HUBLink, Inc. HUBLink
of Columbus, Ohio, an integration software tool company. This business
combination has been accounted for as a pooling-of-interests combination.
Merger costs totaling $1,060 resulting from the Company acquisition of
HUBLink include investment banking fees, legal and accounting fees,
travel and severance costs. The financial position and results of
operations of the Company have been restated for all periods prior to the
Merger to give retroactive effect to the Merger.

Criterion Health Strategies, Inc.
In October 1994, the Company committed to make certain loans to Criterion
Health Strategies, Inc. CHS of Nashville, Tennessee, a provider of
data management software tools and services, with such loans being
convertible into a 64% equity ownership interest in CHS. During December
1995, Massey Burch Capital Corp. Massey Burch agreed to share equally
HIE funding commitment to CHS in exchange for half of HIE potential
equity ownership interest in CHS. In December 1996, HIE acquired an
option the Option to purchase Massey Burch potential equity
ownership interest in CHS. In June 1997, the existing and potential
equity ownership interests of various parties in CHS were restructured
and all equity ownership interests in CHS held by persons other than HIE
and Massey Burch were canceled in exchange for the grant of options to
purchase 199 shares of HIE common stock to CHS executive management and
other employees at the fair value on the date of grant.
On December 31, 1997, HIE exercised the Option to acquire Massey Burch
50% equity ownership interest in CHS, bringing HIE equity ownership
interest in CHS to 100%, in exchange for 416 shares of HIE common stock
and warrants to purchase 50 shares of HIE common stock for $159 per
share exercisable through December 2003. The warrants were still
outstanding at December 31, 1998. Prior to HIE acquisition of the
majority interest in CHS, the Company share of the losses of CHS was
netted against notes receivable from CHS and shown as losses of affiliate
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. CHS' results of
operations were included in the Company consolidated statements of
operations beginning on January 1, 1998.

The acquisition of CHS was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. The total purchase price of CHS was $3,200. The acquisition
resulted in purchased in-process research and development of $1,746,
which was expensed in 1997, purchased software of $715 and additional
cost over net assets acquired of $336. The Company also assumed an $840
obligation to a third party for the exclusive use of a software tool in
the healthcare industry.
The purchased in-process research and development charge relates to a
back-end software integration tool research and development project
designed to facilitate the analysis of data stored in various disparate
information systems. The amount of this purchased in-process research and
development charge was determined based on the present value of
management estimate of the future cash flows discounted by a
risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 45% expected to be
derived from the new software integration tool for its estimated
eight-year life subsequent to the completion of the project, after
consideration of the fair value of the other CHS assets acquired. At the
date of acquisition, management estimated that this research and
development project was approximately 50% complete measured in terms of
the total estimated man-hours for the project. During 1998, this project
was completed with costs incurred of $150.
The following pro forma financial information presents the combined
results of operations of HIE and CHS as if the acquisition had occurred
as of January 1, 1997, after giving effect to certain adjustments,
including the amortization of goodwill and purchased software and related

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996
In thousands, except per share amounts
Under SFAS 109, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities which will result
in future deductible or taxable amounts and for net operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is then established to
reduce the deferred income tax assets to the level at which it is more
likely than not that any tax benefits will be realized. Realization of
tax benefits of deductible temporary differences and operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards depends on having sufficient taxable income
within the carryback and carryforward periods. Sources of taxable
income that may allow for the realization of tax benefits include 1
taxable income in the current year or prior years that is available
through carryback, 2 future taxable income that will result from the
reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, and 3 future
taxable income generated by future operations. The valuation allowance
for deferred income tax assets at December 31, 1998 and 1997 was $6,166
and $6,582, respectively. The net decrease increase in the valuation
allowance for deferred income tax assets for the years ended December
31, 1998 and 1997 was $416 and $3,422, respectively. Based on the
level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable
income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are
deductible, management believes it is more likely than not the Company
will realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets, net of existing
valuation allowances at December 31, 1998.
At December 31, 1998, the Company had the following estimated credits
and net operating loss carryforwards available for Federal income tax
reporting purposes to be applied against future taxable income and tax

Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan
On October 20, 1995, the Company established a stock plan for
non-employee directors whereby such directors may elect to receive all or
a portion of their annual retainer fee in unrestricted shares of the
Company common stock. As of December 31, 1998, none of the 250 shares
reserved for this plan have been issued.
Stock Purchase Plan
On July 1, 1996, the Company commenced an employee stock purchase plan
for all eligible employees of HIE and designated subsidiaries.
Participants may use up to 10% of their compensation to purchase the
Company common stock through payroll deductions for 85% of the lower of
the beginning or ending stock price on a quarterly basis. Of the 200
shares of the Company common stock reserved for issuance under this
plan, 92 shares, 82 shares and 14 shares were issued during the years
ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
Shareholder Rights Plan
On October 20, 1995, the Company Board of Directors declared a dividend
distribution of one purchase right for each share of the Company common
stock outstanding as of October 30, 1995. If a person or group acquires
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company outstanding common
stock or announces a tender offer or exchange that would result in the
acquisition of a beneficial ownership right of 20% or more of the
Company outstanding common stock, the rights detach from the common
stock and are distributed to shareholders as separate securities. Each
right entitles its holder to purchase

Stock, at a purchase price of $50 per unit. The rights, which do not have
voting power, expire on October 23, 2005 unless previously distributed
and may be redeemed by the Company in whole at a price of $001 per right
at any time before and within 10 days after their distribution. If the
Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination
transaction, or 50% of its assets or earnings power are sold at any time
after the rights become exercisable, the rights entitle a holder to buy a
number of common shares of the acquiring company having a market value of
twice the exercise price of the right. If a person acquires 20% of the
Company common stock or if a 15% or larger holder merges with the
Company and the common stock is not changed or exchanged in such merger,
or engages in self-dealing transactions with the Company, each right not
owned by such holder becomes exercisable for the number of common shares
of the Company having a market value of twice the exercise price of the
right.
9  Employee Benefit Plans
The Company and its subsidiaries, Healthcare Communications, Inc. HCI
and HUBLink, each previously maintained a 401k defined contribution
plan for the benefit of their employees. Prior to June 1, 1996, the
Company obligation for contributions under its 401k plan was limited
to the lesser of i one-half of each participant contribution but not
more than 25% of the participant compensation or ii 20% of the
Company pretax earnings before consideration of this contribution.
Subsequent to June 1, 1996, Company contributions are discretionary. The
HCI plan provided for HCI contributions equal to one-half of each
participant contributions up to 3% of the participant base salary.
The HUBLink plan provided for discretionary matching contributions.
During 1998, the Company merged the HCI 401k plan and the HUBLink
401k plan into HIE 401k plan. Contributions to the plans included
in the consolidated statements of operations were $212, $72, and $79 in
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
10  Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company uses financial instruments in the normal course of its
business. The carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable, and deferred revenue approximate fair value due to the
short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities. The Company
estimates that the carrying amounts of the Company long-term debt
approximates the fair value based on the current rates offered to the
Company for debt of the same remaining maturities.
