MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of Marriott International, Inc. the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers and
effected by the Companys Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is supported by written policies
and procedures that: 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the Companys transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could
have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In connection with the preparation of the Companys annual consolidated financial
statements, management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January2, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO Framework. Managements assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and testing of the
operational effectiveness of those controls. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that as of January2, 2009, the
Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the
Companys consolidated financial statements included in this report, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting, a copy of which appears on the next page of this annual
report.

MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements present the results of operations, financial
position, and cash flows of Marriott International, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, we, us, or the Company. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods, and the disclosures of contingent liabilities. Accordingly, ultimate results could differ from those
estimates. As a result of the discontinuation of our synthetic fuel business on November3, 2007, the balances and
activities of the synthetic fuel reportable segment have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to our 2008 presentation. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present
fairly our financial position at fiscal year-end 2008 and fiscal year-end 2007 and the results of our operations and cash flows for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006. We have eliminated all material intercompany transactions and balances between
entities consolidated in these financial statements. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest to December31. The fiscal years in the following table encompass a 52-week period, except
for 2002 and 2008, which both encompass a 53-week period. Unless otherwise specified, each reference to a particular year means the fiscal year ended on the date shown in the following table, rather than the corresponding calendar year:  Fiscal Year

Revenue Recognition Our revenues include: 1base management and incentive management fees; 2franchise fees; 3revenues from lodging
properties and other businesses owned or leased by us; 4timeshare sales and services, which also includes resort rental revenue, interest income associated with our Loans to timeshare owners, Timeshare segment note securitization
gains, and revenue from our points-based use system; and 5cost reimbursements. Management fees comprise a base fee, which is a percentage of the revenues of hotels, and an incentive fee, which is generally based on hotel profitability.
Franchise fees comprise initial application fees and continuing royalties generated from our franchise programs, which permit the hotel owners and operators to use certain of our brand names. Cost reimbursements include direct and indirect costs
that are reimbursed to us by lodging properties that we manage or franchise. Base Management and Incentive Management Fees: We
recognize base management fees as revenue when earned in accordance with the contract. In interim periods and at year-end, we recognize incentive management fees that would be due as if the contract were to terminate at that date, exclusive of any
termination fees payable or receivable by us. Franchise Fee Revenue: We recognize franchise fees as revenue in each accounting
period as fees are earned from the franchisee. Owned and Leased Units: We recognize room sales and revenues from other guest
services for our owned and leased units when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered. 
79 Table of Contents
Timeshare and Fractional Intervals and Condominiums: We recognize sales when: 1we have
received a minimum of 10 percent of the purchase price; 2the purchasers period to cancel for a refund has expired; 3we deem the receivables to be collectible; and 4we have attained certain minimum sales and construction
levels. We defer all revenue using the deposit method for sales that do not meet all four of these criteria. For sales that do not qualify for full revenue recognition as the project has progressed beyond the preliminary stages but has not yet
reached completion, all revenue and profit are deferred and recognized in earnings using the percentage of completion method. Timeshare
Points-Based Use System Revenue: As sales under this points-based use system are considered to be the sale of real estate, we recognize these sales when the criteria noted in the Timeshare and Fractional Intervals and Condominiums
caption are met. Timeshare Residential Stand-Alone Structures: We recognize sales under the full accrual method of accounting
when we receive our proceeds and transfer title at settlement. Cost Reimbursements: We recognize cost reimbursements from managed,
franchised, and timeshare properties when we incur the related reimbursable costs. Other Revenue includes third-party licensing
fees, other branding fees, land rental income, and other revenue. Ground Leases We are both the lessor and lessee of land under long-term operating leases, which include scheduled increases in minimum rents. We
recognize these scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term. Real Estate Sales We account for the sales of real estate in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards FAS No66, Accounting
for Sales of Real Estate FAS No66. We reduce gains on sales of real estate by the maximum exposure to loss if we have continuing involvement with the property and do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards
of ownership. In sales transactions where we retain a management contract, the terms and conditions of the management contract are generally comparable to the terms and conditions of the management contracts obtained directly with third-party owners
in competitive bid processes. Profit Sharing Plan We contribute to a profit sharing plan for the benefit of employees meeting certain eligibility requirements and electing participation in
the plan. Contributions are determined based on a specified percentage of salary deferrals by participating employees. We recognized compensation costs from profit sharing of $111 million in 2008, $107 million in 2007, and $86 million in 2006.
Self-Insurance Programs We are self-insured for certain levels of property, liability, workers compensation and employee medical coverage. We accrue estimated costs of these self-insurance programs at the present value of projected
settlements for known and incurred but not reported claims. We use a discount rate of 30 percent to determine the present value of the projected settlements, which we consider to be reasonable given our history of settled claims, including payment
patterns and the fixed nature of the individual settlements. We are subject to a variety of assessments related to our
insurance activities, including those by state guaranty funds and workers compensation second-injury funds. Our liabilities recorded for assessments are reflected within the amounts shown in our Consolidated Balance Sheets on the
self-insurance reserves line, are not discounted, and totaled $4 million and $5 million for year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, respectively. Our liability of $4 million as of year-end 2008 for assessments is expected to be paid by the end of 2009.
Marriott Rewards Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our lodging operations, purchases of timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and
residential products and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners programs, such as those offered by car rental and credit card companies. Points, which we track on members behalf, can be redeemed for stays at
most of our lodging operations, airline tickets, airline frequent flyer program miles, rental cars, and a variety of other awards; however, points cannot be redeemed for cash. We provide Marriott Rewards as a marketing program to 
80 Table of Contents
participating properties. We charge the cost of operating the program, including the estimated cost of award redemption, to properties based on members
qualifying expenditures. We defer revenue received from managed, franchised, and Marriott-owned/leased hotels and program
partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including
an estimate of the breakage for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgment factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including
marketing, promotion, communication with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that hotels reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue
from properties in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of
the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed. Our liability for the Marriott Rewards program was
$1,536 million at year-end 2008 and $1,392 million at year-end 2007. Guarantees We record a liability for the fair value of a guarantee on the date a guarantee is issued or modified. The offsetting entry depends on the
circumstances in which the guarantee was issued. Funding under the guarantee reduces the recorded liability. When no funding is forecasted, the liability is amortized into income on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the guarantee. On
a quarterly basis, we evaluate all material estimated liabilities based on the operating results and the terms of the guarantee. If we conclude that it is probable that we will be required to fund a greater amount than previously estimated, we will
record a loss. Rebates and Allowances We participate in various vendor rebate and allowance arrangements as a manager of hotel properties. There are three types of programs that are common in the hotel industry that are sometimes referred to as
rebates or allowances, including unrestricted rebates, marketing restricted rebates and sponsorships. The primary business purpose of these arrangements is to secure favorable pricing for our hotel owners for various
products and services or enhance resources for promotional campaigns co-sponsored by certain vendors. More specifically, unrestricted rebates are funds returned to the buyer, generally based upon volumes or quantities of goods purchased. Marketing
restricted allowances are funds allocated by vendor agreements for certain marketing or other joint promotional initiatives. Sponsorships are funds paid by vendors, generally used by the vendor to gain exposure at meetings and events, which are
accounted for as a reduction of the cost of the event. We account for rebates and allowances as adjustments of the prices
of the vendors products and services. We show vendor costs and the reimbursement of those costs as reimbursed costs and cost reimbursements revenue, respectively; therefore, rebates are reflected as a reduction of these line items. 
Cash and Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Restricted Cash Restricted cash, totaling $103 million and $153 million at year-end 2008 and year-end 2007,
respectively, is recorded in the Other long-term assets line in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Restricted cash primarily consists of cash held internationally that has not been repatriated due to accounting, statutory, tax
and foreign currency risks, and deposits received on timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential sales that are held in escrow until the contract is closed. Assets Held for Sale We consider properties other than Timeshare segment interval,
fractional ownership, and residential products, which we classify as inventory to be assets held for sale when all of the following criteria are met:  management commits to a plan to sell a property;  it is unlikely that the disposal plan will be significantly modified or discontinued; 
81 Table of Contents the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition;  actions required to complete the sale of the property have been initiated;  sale of the property is probable and we expect the completed sale will occur within one year; and  the property is actively being marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable given its current market value. Upon designation as an asset held for sale, we record the carrying value of each property at the lower of its carrying value or its
estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell, and we cease depreciation. At year-end 2008, we had no assets held for
sale or liabilities related to assets held for sale. Assets held for sale totaled $123 million at year-end 2007 and
consisted of property and equipment. The $123 million total reflected the following segment composition: North American Full-Service-$17 million; North American Limited-Service-$17 million; and Luxury-$89 million. There were no liabilities of assets
held for sale at year-end 2007. In 2007, we reclassified the balances associated with one property, in conformity with
other held and used properties, as the property no longer satisfied the criteria to be classified as held for sale. In conjunction with that reclassification, we recorded depreciation expense of $4 million in 2007 that would
have been recognized in 2006 and $4 million in late 2007 that would have been recognized earlier in 2007 had the asset been continuously classified as held and used. Loan Loss Reserves Lodging Senior Loans and Lodging Mezzanine and Other Loans We measure loan impairment based on the
present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the
recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the
purpose of applying such policy. For loans that we have determined to be impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. Loans to Timeshare Owners We record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable
that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We assess uncollectibility based on pools of receivables because we hold large numbers of homogeneous timeshare notes
receivable. We estimate uncollectibles based on historical activity for similar timeshare notes receivable from 2004 forward. We use a technique referred to as static pool analysis, which tracks uncollectibles for each years sales over the
life of those notes. Valuation of Goodwill We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other
circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections that assume certain
growth projections, which may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is greater than its estimated fair value. Investments We
consolidate entities that we control. We account for investments in joint ventures using the equity method of accounting when we exercise significant influence over the venture. If we do not exercise significant influence, we account for the
investment using the cost method of accounting. We account for investments in limited partnerships and limited liability companies using the equity method of accounting when we own more than a minimal investment. Our ownership interest in these
equity method investments varies generally from 10 percent to 50 percent. The fair value of our available-for-sale
securities totaled $10 million and $55 million at year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, respectively. We included net unrealized holding losses gains on available-for-sale securities of $10 million at year-end 2008 and $9 million at year-end
2007 in accumulated other comprehensive income. The amount of net losses gains reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the sale of 
82 Table of Contents
available-for-sale securities totaled $2 million and $18 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. We determined the cost basis of the securities sold using
specific identification. Costs Incurred to Sell Real Estate Projects We charge the majority of sales and marketing costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred. Selling and marketing costs
deferred were $7 million at year-end 2008 and $6 million at year-end 2007 and are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in the Other caption within the Current assets section. If a contract is canceled, we
charge unrecoverable direct selling and marketing costs to expense and record deposits forfeited as income. Residual Interests 
We periodically sell notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval
and fractional products. We continue to service the notes and transfer all proceeds collected to special purpose entities. We retain servicing assets and other interests in the notes and account for these assets and interests as residual interests.
The interests are limited to the present value of cash available after paying financing expenses and program fees and absorbing credit losses. We measure our servicing assets using the fair value method. Under the fair value method, we carry
servicing assets on the balance sheet at fair value and report the changes in fair value, primarily due to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions and to the collection or realization of expected cash flows, in earnings in the period in which
the change occurs. We treat the residual interests, including servicing assets, as trading securities under the provisions of FAS No115. At the dates of sale and at the end of each reporting period, we estimate the fair value of
the residual interests, including servicing assets, using a discounted cash flow model. We report changes in the fair values of these residual interests, including servicing assets, through the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.
The most significant estimate involved in the measurement process is the discount rate, followed by the default rate and
the loan repayment rate. Estimates of these rates are based on managements expectations of future prepayment rates and default rates, reflecting our historical experience, industry trends, current market interest rates, expected future
interest rates, and other considerations. Actual repayment rates, default rates, and discount rates could differ from those projected by management due to changes in a variety of economic factors, including prevailing interest rates and the
availability of alternative financing sources to borrowers. If actual prepayments of the loans being serviced occurs more slowly than we project, the carrying value of servicing assets could increase and accretion and servicing income would exceed
previously projected amounts. If actual default rates or actual discount rates are lower than we expect, the carrying value of retained interests could increase and accretion and servicing income would exceed previously projected amounts.
Accordingly, the residual interests, including servicing assets, actually realized, could differ from the amounts initially recorded. For additional information regarding residual interests, see Footnote No5, Fair Value Measurements, and Footnote No12, Asset Securitizations. Derivative Instruments We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for
trading or speculative purposes. We record all derivatives at fair value either as assets or liabilities. We recognize,
currently in earnings, changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and of derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments. We record changes in the fair value of the hedged item in a fair value hedge as an
adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognize the change in the fair value of the derivative in earnings in the same income statement line item. We record the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments as a component of
other comprehensive income and report the ineffective portion currently in earnings. We reclassify amounts included in other comprehensive income into earnings in the same period during which the hedged item affects earnings. Foreign Operations The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our consolidated and unconsolidated entities operating in the United States. The functional currency for our consolidated and unconsolidated entities operating outside of the United States is
generally the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. For consolidated entities whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we translate their financial statements into U.S.
dollars, and we do the same, as needed, for unconsolidated entities whose functional currency is 
83 Table of Contents
not the U.S. dollar. We translate assets and liabilities at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date, and income statement accounts are
translated using the weighted average exchange rate for the period. We include translation adjustments from foreign exchange and the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature as a separate
component of shareholders equity. We report gains and losses from foreign exchange rate changes related to intercompany receivables and payables that are not of a long-term investment nature, as well as gains and losses from foreign currency
transactions, currently in operating costs and expenses, and those amounted to a $6 million loss in 2008, a $2 million loss in 2007, and a $6 million gain in 2006. Gains and other income for 2007 included $6 million attributable to currency
translation adjustment gains, net of losses, from the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of investments. There were no similar gains or losses in 2008. New Accounting Standards EITF
Issue No06-8, Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyers Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66 for Sales of Condominiums We adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue
No06-8, Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyers Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No66 for Sales of Condominiums EITF 06-8 on December29, 2007, the first day of our 2008 fiscal year.
EITF 06-8 states that in assessing the collectibility of the sales price pursuant to paragraph 37d of FAS No66, an entity should evaluate the adequacy of the buyers initial and continuing investment to conclude that the sales price is
collectible. If an entity is unable to meet the criteria of paragraph 37, including an assessment of collectibility using the initial and continuing investment tests described in paragraphs 8 through 12 of FAS No66, then the entity should
apply the deposit method of accounting as described in paragraphs 65 through 67 of FAS No66. Although our adoption
of EITF 06-8 had no impact on our wholly owned projects, in conjunction with the adoption of EITF 06-8 by one joint venture in which we are a partner, we recorded the cumulative effect of applying EITF 06-8 as a reduction of $5 million to our
investment in that joint venture, an increase in deferred tax assets of $2 million, and a reduction of $3 million to the opening balance of our retained earnings. The application of the continuing investment criterion in EITF 06-8 on the
collectibility of the sales price could in certain future circumstances delay our ability, or the ability of joint ventures in which we are a partner, to recognize revenues and costs using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.
Financial Accounting Standards No157, Fair Value Measurements We adopted FAS No157, Fair Value Measurements FAS No157, on December29, 2007, the first day
of fiscal year 2008. FAS No157 defines fair value, establishes a methodology for measuring fair value, and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements. On February12, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS
157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No157, which amends FAS No157 by delaying its effective date by one year for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at
fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Therefore, beginning on December29, 2007, this standard applied prospectively to new fair value measurements of financial instruments and recurring fair value measurements of
non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities. On January3, 2009, the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year, the standard will also apply to all other fair value measurements. See Footnote No5, Fair Value Measurements, for
additional information. Financial Accounting Standards No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities- Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No115 We adopted FAS No159, The Fair
Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No115 FAS No159, on December29, 2007, the first day of our 2008 fiscal year. This standard permits but does
not require entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. We did not elect the fair value measurement option for any of our financial assets or liabilities in 2008. EITF Issue No07-6, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate Subject to the Requirements of FASB Statement No66, Accounting for
Sales of Real Estate, When the Agreement Includes a Buy-Sell Clause We adopted EITF Issue No07-6,
Accounting for Sales of Real Estate Subject to the Requirements of FASB Statement No66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, When the Agreement Includes a Buy-Sell Clause EITF 07-6, on December29,
2007, the first day of our 2008 fiscal year. EITF 07-6 clarifies whether a buy-sell clause is a prohibited form of continuing involvement that would preclude partial sales treatment under FAS No66. 
84 Table of Contents
EITF 07-6 is effective for new arrangements entered into and assessments of existing transactions originally accounted for under the deposit, profit sharing,
leasing, or financing methods for reasons other than the exercise of a buy-sell clause performed in 2008 and thereafter. The adoption of EITF 07-6 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. FASB Staff Position FAS No140-4 and FIN 46R-8 Disclosures by Public Entities Enterprises about Transfers of Financial Assets and
Interests in Variable Interest Entities We adopted FASB Staff Position FSP FAS No140-4 and
FIN 46R-8 Disclosures by Public Entities Enterprises about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities in conjunction with our 2008 fiscal year-end. FSP FAS No140-4 and FIN 46R-8 amends FAS
No140 to require public entities to provide additional disclosures about transferors continuing involvements with transferred financial assets. It also amends FIN 46R to require public enterprises, including sponsors that have a
variable interest in a variable interest entity, to provide additional disclosures about their involvement with variable interest entities. The FSP also requires disclosures by a public enterprise that is a sponsor of a qualifying special-purpose
entity SPE that holds a variable interest in the qualifying SPE but was not the transferor of financial assets to the qualifying SPE and a servicer of a qualifying SPE that holds a significant variable interest in the qualifying SPE
but was not the transferor of financial assets to the qualifying SPE. FSP FAS No140-4 and FIN 46R-8 is effective for year-end 2008 disclosures. The adoption of FSP FAS No140-4 and FIN 46R-8 did not have a material impact on our
financial statements. FSP EITF 99-20-1 Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No99-20, Recognition of
Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continue to be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets We adopted FSP EITF 99-20-1 Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No99-20, Recognition of Interest Income
and Impairment on Purchased Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continue to be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets, FSP EITF 99-20-1 in conjunction with our 2008 fiscal year-end. FSP
EITF99-20-1 amends EITF Issue No99-20 to align the impairment guidance in EITF Issue No99-20 with that of FAS No115. FAS No115 measures impairment based on a determination of whether an other-than-temporary
impairment has occurred. Our residual interests in our asset securitizations are recorded at fair value each reporting period. Therefore, the adoption of FSP EITF 99-20-1 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Future Adoption of Accounting Standards Financial Accounting Standards No141 Revised 2007, Business Combinations On
December4, 2007, the FASB issued FAS No141 Revised 2007, Business Combinations FAS No141R. FAS No141R will significantly change the accounting for business combinations. Under FAS
No141R, an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. Transaction costs will no longer be included in the
measurement of the business acquired. Instead, these costs will be expensed as they are incurred. FAS No141R also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements. FAS No141R applies prospectively to business
combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year. Financial Accounting Standards No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements-an Amendment of ARB
No51 On December4, 2007, the FASB issued FAS No160, Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements-an Amendment of ARB No51 FAS No160. FAS No160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of
a subsidiary. Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements separate from the parents equity. The amount of net income attributable to
the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. FAS No160 clarifies that changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are
equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or loss will be measured using the
fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date. FAS No160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. FAS No160 must be applied
prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year except for the presentation and 
85 Table of Contents
disclosure requirements, which must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No160 will
have on our financial statements. Financial Accounting Standards No161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No133 In March 2008, the FASB issued FAS No161,
Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No133 FAS No161. FAS No161 requires enhanced disclosure related to derivatives and hedging activities and
thereby seeks to improve the transparency of financial reporting. Under FAS No161, entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures relating to: ahow and why an entity uses derivative instruments; bhow derivative
instruments and related hedge items are accounted for under FAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities FAS No133, and its related interpretations; and chow derivative
instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. FAS No161 must be applied prospectively to all derivative instruments and non-derivative instruments that are designated
and qualify as hedging instruments and related hedged items accounted for under FAS No133 for all financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009
fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No161 will have on our financial statements.  2.
INCOME TAXES We adopted the
provisions of FASB Interpretation No. FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48, on December30, 2006, the first day of fiscal year 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we
recorded a $155 million increase in the net liability for unrecognized tax positions, which was recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings and additional paid-in-capital on December30, 2006. The total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits as of year-end 2008 and year-end 2007 was $141 million and $132 million, respectively. Included in the balances at year-end 2008 and year-end 2007 were $87 million and $97 million, respectively, of tax positions that, if
recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The unrecognized tax benefit reconciliation from the beginning balance to
the ending balance is as follows:  in millions
Amount Unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year December 30, 2006 244 Change attributable to tax positions taken during a prior period 163 Change attributable to tax positions taken during the current period 5 Decrease attributable to settlements with taxing authorities 279 Decrease attributable to lapse of statute of limitations 1 Unrecognized tax benefit at end of year December 29, 2007 132 Change attributable to tax positions taken during a prior period 92 Change attributable to tax positions taken during the current period 5 Decrease attributable to settlements with taxing authorities 86 Decrease attributable to lapse of statute of limitations 2 Unrecognized tax benefit at end of year January 2, 2009 141 In accordance with our accounting policy, we recognize accrued interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. This policy did not change as a result of the adoption of FIN 48. Our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended January2, 2009, and our Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of that date include interest of $42 million and $29 million, respectively. Our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December28, 2007, and our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of that date include interest of $18
million and $8 million, respectively. We file income tax returns, including returns for our subsidiaries, with federal,
state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. We are participating in the Internal Revenue Service IRS Compliance Assurance Program CAP for the 2008 and 2007 tax years and we intend to participate for 2009. This program
accelerates the examination of key transactions with the goal of resolving any issues before the tax return is filed. Our federal income tax returns have been examined and we have settled all issues for tax years through 2004 with the exception of
one 1994 transaction discussed below. The 2005 and 2006 examinations have been completed, and the issues 
86 Table of Contents
from those years are now at the IRS Appeals Division. Various state, local, and foreign income tax returns are also under examination by taxing authorities.
In 2008, we recorded a $24 million income tax expense primarily related to the treatment of funds received from certain
foreign subsidiaries. We are contesting the issue with the IRS for tax years 2005 and 2006. In addition, we recorded a $19 million tax expense in 2008 due primarily to prior years tax adjustments, including a settlement with the IRS that
resulted in a lower than expected refund of taxes associated with a 1995 leasing transaction. The settlement resulted in a $26 million tax refund, which we received during 2008. We also recorded, in 2008, a $29 million income tax expense primarily related to an unfavorable U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision
involving a refund claim associated with a 1994 tax planning transaction. The tax had been paid, and we had filed a refund claim to recover the taxes. We have appealed the ruling. For 2008, we increased unrecognized tax benefits by $97 million, including increases for the foreign subsidiaries issue as well as the
1994 tax planning transaction issue. For the same period, we decreased unrecognized tax benefits by $88 million related primarily to the settlement of the 1995 leasing transaction. The balance of unrecognized tax benefits was $141 million at
year-end 2008. In 2007, we reached a settlement of issues raised during the IRS and Department of Labors
examination of the employee stock ownership plan ESOP feature of the Companys Employees Profit Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan the Plan. The settlement resulted in an after-tax charge in 2007 totaling $54
million and a reduction in shareholders equity of $115 million. The $54 million charge included $35 million of excise taxes impacting general, administrative, and other expense, $13 million of interest expense on those excise taxes, and $6
million of income tax expense primarily reflecting additional interest. As a result of the settlement, we have made cash payments to the U.S. Treasury and state tax jurisdictions of $206 million through year-end 2008. The payments reflect income
taxes, excise taxes, and interest charges. No penalties were assessed. For additional information regarding the Plan and the ESOP settlement, see Footnote No3, Income Taxes,in our 2007Form10-K. As a large taxpayer, we are under continual audit by the IRS and other taxing authorities. It is possible that the amount of the
liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change during the next 52-week period, but we do not anticipate that a significant impact to the unrecognized tax benefit balance will occur. Total deferred tax assets and liabilities as of year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, were as follows:  in millions
2008 2007 Deferred tax assets 1,048 1,013 Deferred tax liabilities 135 150 Net deferred taxes 913 863 The tax effect of each type of temporary difference and carry-forward that gives

reduction of 2008 Federal and Hawaii income taxes associated with investment tax credits that arose in 2008 that we account for using the flow-through method in accordance with APB Opinion No4, Accounting for the Investment
Credit. At year-end 2008, we had approximately $10 million of tax credits that expire through 2028, of which $3 million are investment tax credits and $226 million of tax credits that do not expire. We recorded $24 million of net operating
loss benefits in 2008. At year-end 2008, we had approximately $749 million of net operating losses, of which $447 million expire through 2028. 
87 Table of Contents
We have made no provision for U.S. income taxes or additional foreign taxes on the
cumulative unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries $911 million as of year-end 2008 because we consider these earnings to be permanently invested. These earnings could become subject to additional taxes if remitted as dividends, loaned to us
or a U.S. affiliate or if we sold our interests in the affiliates. We cannot practically estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on the unremitted earnings. We conduct business in countries that grant a holiday from
income taxes for 10- and 30-year periods. The holidays expire through 2034. The aggregate amount of taxes not incurred due to tax holidays and the related earnings per share impacts are $14 million $004 per diluted share, $14 million
$004 per diluted share, and $22 million $005 per diluted share for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS-SYNTHETIC FUEL Our synthetic fuel operations consisted of four coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities the Facilities. Because tax credits under Section45K of the Internal Revenue Code are not available for the production and
sale of synthetic fuel produced from coal after calendar year-end 2007, and because we estimated that high oil prices during 2007 would result in the phase-out of a significant portion of the tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and
sold in 2007, on November3, 2007, we shut down the Facilities and permanently ceased production of synthetic fuel. Accordingly, we now report this business as a discontinued operation. The tax credits available under the Internal Revenue Code for the production and sale of synthetic fuels were established by Congress to
encourage the development of alternative domestic energy sources. Congress deemed that the incentives provided by the tax credits would not be necessary if the price of oil increased beyond certain thresholds as prices would then provide a more
natural market for these alternative fuels. As a result, the tax credits available under the Internal Revenue Code for the production and sale of synthetic fuel in any given calendar year 
88 Table of Contents
were phased out if the Reference Price of a barrel of oil for that year fell within a specified range. The Reference Price of a barrel of oil is an estimate
of the annual average wellhead price per barrel of domestic crude oil and was determined for each calendar year by the Secretary of the Treasury by April1 of the following year. The price range within which the credit was phased out was set in
1980 and was adjusted annually for inflation. In 2007, the Reference Price phase-out range was $5678 to $7127. Because the Reference Price of a barrel of oil for 2007 was within that range, at $6652, there was a 672 percent reduction of the tax
credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2007. Income from discontinued operations of $3 million in 2008, primarily reflected the recognition in 2008 of additional tax credits as a result of the determination by the Secretary of the
Treasury in 2008 of the Reference Price of a barrel of oil for 2007, partially offset by obligations based on the amount of additional tax credits. The determination resulted in a 672 percent reduction of tax credits for the 2007 fiscal year,
compared to the reduction of 707 percent that had been estimated and recorded in the 2007 fiscal year. The following
tables provide additional income statement and balance sheet information relating to the discontinued synthetic fuel operations. Income

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Under our
2002 Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan, we award: 1stock options to purchase our ClassA Common Stock Stock Option Program; 2stock appreciation rights SARs for our ClassA Common Stock;
3restricted stock units of our ClassA Common Stock; and 4deferred stock units. We grant awards at exercise prices or strike prices that are equal to the market price of our ClassA Common Stock on the date of grant.
For all share-based awards FAS No123R requires that we measure compensation costs related to our share-based
payment transactions at fair value on the grant date and that we recognize those costs in the financial statements over the vesting period during which the employee provides service in exchange for the award. During 2008 we granted 56million restricted stock units 26 million, most of which were granted in February and had a weighted
average grant-date fair value of $35 per unit and 30million were granted in August and had a weighted average grant-date fair value of $26 per unit, 27million Employee SARs 18 million, most of which were granted in February and had
a weighted average grant-date fair value of $13 per right and 09million were granted in August and had a weighted average grant-date fair value of $10 per right, and 4,000 Non-employee SARs. During that time period, we also granted
approximately 218,000 stock options and issued 25,000 deferred stock units. The grants made in August would ordinarily have been made in February, 2009 but were accelerated to encourage associate retention in a difficult economic climate. Awards for
the most senior executives were not accelerated. Under FAS No123R, we recorded share-based compensation expense
related to award grants of $112 million in 2008, $104 million in 2007, and $108 million in 2006. Deferred compensation costs related to unvested awards 
89 Table of Contents
totaled $215 million at year-end 2008 and $162 million at year-end 2007, and the weighted average period over which we expect the deferred compensation costs
at year-end 2008 to be recognized is two years. For share-based compensation grants that occur after the adoption of FAS
No123R, which for us was the first day of fiscal year 2006, FAS No123R requires that share-based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the grant date to the date on which the award is no longer contingent on the
employee providing additional service the substantive vesting period. We continue to follow the stated vesting period for the unvested portion of awards granted prior to adoption of FAS No123R and follow the substantive
vesting period for awards granted after the adoption of FAS No123R. In accordance with FAS No123R, we
present the tax benefits resulting from the exercise or vesting of share-based awards as financing cash flows. Tax benefits resulting from the exercise of share-based awards totaled $21 million, $114 million, and $194 million for 2008, 2007, and
2006, respectively. The aggregate amount of cash we received from the exercise of stock options granted under share-based
payment arrangements was $30 million, $89 million, and $184 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Restricted Stock Units 
We issue restricted stock units under the Comprehensive Plan to certain officers and key employees and those units vest
generally over four years in annual installments commencing one year after the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for the restricted stock units over the service period equal to the fair market value of the stock units on the date of
issuance. Upon vesting, restricted stock units convert to shares and are distributed from treasury shares. At year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, we had approximately $192 million and $145 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related
to restricted stock units. Share-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock units was $85 million, $82 million, and $77 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The weighted average remaining term for restricted stock unit
grants outstanding at year-end 2008 was two years. Restricted stock units converted and distributed during 2008, 2007, and 2006, had aggregate intrinsic values of $90 million, $147 million, and $78 million, respectively. The weighted average
grant-date fair values of restricted stock units granted in 2008, 2007, and 2006 were $30, $49, and $35, respectively. Changes in our outstanding restricted stock unit grants in 2008 were as follows:   millions WeightedAverageGrant-DateFair Value

ClassA Common Stock on the date of grant. Non-qualified options generally expire 10 years after the date of grant, except those issued from 1990 through 2000, which expire 15 years after the date of the grant. Most stock options under the
Stock Option Program are exercisable in cumulative installments of one quarter at the end of each of the first four years following the date of grant. We recognized compensation expense associated with employee stock options of $6 million in 2008, $12 million in 2007, and $22 million in 2006. At year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, there was approximately $2 million and
$6 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to employee stock options. Upon the exercise of stock options, we issue shares from treasury shares.

The total intrinsic value of options outstanding at year-end 2008 and year-end
2007 was $88 million and $636 million, respectively, and the total intrinsic value for stock options exercisable as of year-end 2008 and year-end 2007 was $95 million and $624 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options
exercised during 2008, 2007, and 2006 was approximately $42 million, $206 million, and $309 million, respectively. Employee SARs may be granted to officers and key employees at exercise prices or strike prices equal to the market price of our ClassA Common Stock on the date of grant. SARs generally expire 10 years after the date of grant and both
vest and are exercisable in cumulative installments of one quarter at the end of each of the first four years following the date of grant. Non-employee SARs may be granted to directors at exercise prices or strike prices equal to the market price of
our ClassA Common Stock on the date of grant. Non-employee SARs generally expire 10 years after the date of grant and vest upon grant; however, they are generally not exercisable until one year after grant. We first began issuing SARs in 2006.
On exercise of SARs, employees or Non-employee directors receive the number of shares of ClassA Common Stock equal to the number of SARs that are being exercised multiplied by the quotient of athe final value minus the base value,
divided by bthe final value. We recognized compensation expense associated with Employee SARs and Non-employee
SARs of $18 million in 2008, $5 million in 2007, and $3 million in 2006. At the end of 2008 and 2007, we had approximately $19 million and $7 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to SARs. Upon the exercise of SARs, shares
are issued from treasury shares.

outstanding was zero at year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, and the total intrinsic value of SARs exercisable was zero as of year-end 2008 and year-end 2007. No SARs were exercised in 2008. The total intrinsic value of SARs exercised during 2007 was
$100,000. No SARs were exercised in 2006. We use a binomial method
to estimate the fair value of each stock option or SAR granted. The assumptions for stock options and employee SARs for 2008, 2007, and 2006 are noted in the following table 2008 2007 2006
Expected volatility 29 28 30 Dividend yield 080-095 060 060 Risk-free rate 34-39 48 45 Expected term in years 6-9 7 7
The risk-free rates are based on the corresponding U.S. Treasury spot rates for
the expected duration at the date of grant, converted to a continuously compounded rate. Non-employee SARs were valued using assumptions within the ranges shown above for Employee SARs, except using an expected term of 10 years. For Non-employee SARs issued in 2008, 2007, and 2006, the only differences in the assumptions versus employee SARs were the use of
risk-free interest rates of 39 percent, 46 percent, and 50 percent, respectively, and for each years issuances, an expected life of 10 years. Estimated volatilities for 2008, 2007, and 2006 were based on the historical share-price volatility for a period equal to the stock options or SARs expected lives, ending on the day of grant, and
calculated based on weekly data. The weighted average expected stock option or SARs terms for 2008, 2007, and 2006 were a product of the lattice-based binomial valuation model that uses suboptimal exercise factors to calculate the expected terms.
Deferred Stock Units We also issue deferred stock units to Non-employee directors. These Non-employee director deferred stock units vest within one year and are distributed upon election. At year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, there was
approximately $203,000 and $227,000, respectively, in deferred costs related to Non-employee director deferred stock units. The share-based compensation expense, number of deferred stock units granted, weighted average grant-date fair value, and aggregate intrinsic value of Non-employee director deferred stock units are noted in the following table: 2008

At year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, there were 233,000 and 218,000, respectively,
Non-employee deferred stock units outstanding, and the weighted average grant-date fair value of those outstanding deferred stock units was $24 for each of 2008 and 2007. Other Information Although the Comprehensive Plan also provides for issuance of
deferred stock bonus awards, deferred stock awards, and restricted stock awards, our Compensation Policy Committee indefinitely suspended the issuance of deferred bonus stock commencing with our 2001 fiscal year and the issuance of both deferred
stock awards and restricted stock awards commencing with the 2003 fiscal year. At year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, there was approximately $2 million and $4 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to these suspended award
programs, and the weighted average remaining term was one year for such award grants outstanding at year-end 2008. Share-based compensation expense associated with these suspended award programs was $2 million, $4 million, and $6 million for 2008,
2007, and 2006, respectively. At year-end 2008, 58million shares were reserved under the Comprehensive Plan
including 39million shares under the Stock Option Program and Stock Appreciation Right Program.  5.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS We adopted
FAS No157 on December29, 2007, the first day of fiscal year 2008. FAS No157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date an exit price. The standard outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures. Under
GAAP, certain assets and liabilities must be measured at fair value, and FAS No157 details the disclosures that are required for items measured at fair value. We have various financial instruments we must measure under FAS No157 including: certain marketable securities; derivatives; and
servicing assets and residual interests related to our asset securitizations. None of our current non-financial assets or non-financial liabilities must be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. We measure our financial assets and liabilities
using inputs from the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy. The three levels are as follows: Level 1 inputs are unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2
inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or
liability i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc., and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means market corroborated inputs. Level 3 includes unobservable inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability. We develop these inputs based on the best information available, including our own data. In accordance with the
fair value hierarchy, the following table shows the fair value as of year-end 2008, of those financial assets and liabilities that we must measure at fair value and that we classify as Other current assets, Other assets, and
Other long-term liabilities:  in millions

As discussed in Footnote No20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,
we recorded impairment charges during 2008 for some of our inventory and intangible assets. In accordance with the guidance found in FSP No. FAS 157-2, we did not apply the provisions of FAS No157 to these impairments. The following table summarizes the changes in fair value of our Level 3 assets and liabilities for year-end 2008:  in millions
Using Level 3 Inputs ServicingAssetsandOther ResidualInterests DerivativeInstruments Beginning balance at December29, 2007 238 5 Total losses realized or unrealized Included in earnings 9 26 Included in other comprehensive income 6 Transfers in or out of Level 3 Purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements 8 10 Ending balance at January2, 2009 221 15 Gains losses for 2008 included in earnings attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to assets still held at the
reporting date 9 26 At the dates of sale and at the end of each reporting period, we estimate the fair
value of our residual interests, including servicing assets, using a discounted cash flow model. The implementation of FAS No157 did not result in material changes to the models or processes used to value these assets. These transactions may
utilize interest rate swaps to protect the net interest margin associated with the beneficial interest. The discount rates we use in determining the fair values of the residual interests are based on the general level of interest rates in the market
and the assumed credit risk of the interests retained. We adjust these discount rates quarterly as interest rates and credit spreads in the market vary. We treat the residual interests, including servicing assets, as trading securities under the provisions of FAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and
accordingly, we recorded realized and unrealized gains or losses related to these assets in the Timeshare sales and services revenue caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2008 we recorded trading losses of $9 million,
and in 2007 and 2006, we recorded trading gains of $30 million and $19 million, respectively. During 2008, 2007, and 2006,
we used the following key assumptions to measure, at the date of sale, the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets: average discount rates of 923 percent, 902 percent, and 922 percent, respectively; average expected
annual prepayments, including defaults, of 2401 percent, 2502 percent, and 2522 percent, respectively; expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, excluding prepayments and defaults, of 76 months, 75 months, and 70 months
respectively; and expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, including prepayments and defaults, of 35 months, 34 months, and 32 months, respectively. Our key assumptions are based on experience with notes receivable and
servicing assets. We used the following key assumptions in measuring the fair value of the residual interests, including
servicing assets, in our 12 outstanding Timeshare note sales as of year-end 2008: an average discount rate of 1687 percent; an average expected annual prepayment rate, including defaults, of 1808 percent; an expected weighted average life of
prepayable notes receivable, excluding prepayments and defaults, of 59 months; and an expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, including prepayments and defaults, of 35 months. The most significant estimate involved in the measurement process is the discount rate, followed by the default rate and the loan
repayment rate. Estimates of these rates are based on managements expectations of future prepayment rates and default rates, reflecting our historical experience, industry trends, current market interest rates, expected future interest rates,
and other considerations. Actual repayment rates, default rates, and discount rates could differ from those projected by management due to changes in a variety of economic factors, including prevailing interest rates and the availability of
alternative financing sources to borrowers. If actual prepayments of the loans being serviced were to occur more slowly than had been projected, the carrying value of servicing assets could increase and accretion and servicing income would exceed
previously projected amounts. If actual default rates or actual discount rates are lower than expected, the carrying value of retained interests could increase and accretion and servicing income would exceed previously projected amounts.
Accordingly, the retained interests, 
94 Table of Contents
including servicing assets, actually realized, could differ from the amounts initially recorded. If actual prepayments of the loans being serviced occur at a
faster pace than we have projected, the carrying value of servicing assets could decrease and accretion and servicing income would be below previously projected amounts. If actual default rates or actual discount rates are higher than we expect, the
carrying value of retained interests could decrease and accretion and servicing income would be below previously projected amounts. Accordingly, the retained interests, including servicing assets, actually realized, could differ from the amounts
initially recorded. We completed a stress test on the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, as
of the end of 2008 to measure the change in value associated with independent changes in individual key variables. This methodology applied unfavorable changes that would be statistically significant for the key variables of prepayment rate,
discount rate, and weighted average remaining term. Before we applied any of these stress test changes, we determined that the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, was $221 million as of year-end 2008. Applying the stress tests, we concluded that each change to a variable shown in the table below would have the following impact on the
valuation of our residual interests at year-end:  DecreaseinYear-End Valuation$ in millions

We value our derivatives using valuations that are calibrated to the initial trade
prices. Subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation model including interest rates and volatilities. We record realized and unrealized gains and losses on these derivative instruments in gains from the sale of timeshare
notes receivable, which are recorded within the Timeshare sales and services revenue caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we impaired one equity method investment and three other investments for a total of $25 million. Impairment charges of $9 million were recorded in Equity in earnings and
$16 million were recorded in Gains and other income. We used level three inputs in a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of these assets. For additional information, see the Other Charges caption of
Footnote No20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges.

with FAS No128, Earnings per Share, we have not included the following stock options and SARs in our calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices were greater than the average market prices for the
applicable periods:  a
for the year ended January2, 2009, 39million options and SARs, with exercise prices ranging from $3105 to $4903;  b
for the year ended December28, 2007, 04million options and SARs, with exercise prices ranging from $4591 to $4903; and  c
for the year ended December29, 2006, no options or SARs.  7.
INVENTORY Inventory, totaling
$1,981 million and $1,557 million as of January2, 2009, and December28, 2007, respectively, consists primarily of Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products totaling $1,959 million and $1,536 million as of
January2, 2009, and December28, 2007, respectively. Inventory totaling $22 million and $21 million as of January2, 2009, and December28, 2007, respectively, primarily relates to hotel operating supplies for the limited number
of properties we own or lease. We value Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products at the lower of cost or net realizable value and generally value operating supplies at the lower of cost using the first-in,
first-out method or market. Consistent with recognized industry practice, we classify Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products inventory, which has an operating cycle that exceeds 12 months, as a current asset.
We recorded a pretax charge of $22 million in 2008 within the Timeshare-direct caption of our Consolidated
Statements of Income related to the impairment of a fractional and whole ownership real estate project held for development by a joint venture that we consolidate. We recorded a pretax benefit of $12 million in 2008 within the Minority
interest caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income representing our joint venture partners pretax share of the $22 million impairment charge. Accordingly, the impact to our Timeshare segment was $10 million. We made the adjustment
in accordance with FAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, to adjust the carrying value of the real estate to our estimate of its fair value at year-end 2008. The downturn in market conditions
including contract cancellations and tightening in the credit markets, especially for jumbo mortgage loans, were the predominant items considered in our analysis. We estimated the fair value of the inventory utilizing a probability weighted cash
flow model containing our expectations of future performance discounted at a 10-year risk-free interest rate determined from the yield curve for U.S. Treasury instruments 368 percent.

We also recorded a pretax charge of $9 million in 2008 in the
Timeshare-direct caption of our Consolidated Statement of Income for write-downs of inventory due to the termination of certain phases of timeshare development in Europe see the Other Charges caption of Footnote No20

incurred during development and construction. Interest capitalized as a cost of property and equipment totaled $55 million in 2008, $49 million in 2007, and $32 million in 2006. We capitalize the cost of improvements that extend the useful life of
property and equipment when incurred. These capitalized costs may include structural costs, equipment, fixtures, floor, and wall coverings. We expense all repair and maintenance costs as incurred. We compute depreciation using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets three to 40 years, and we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the asset life or lease term. Depreciation expense totaled $155 million in 2008, $162 million in 2007, and $155
million in 2006.  9.
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS 2008 Acquisitions
At year-end 2007, we were party to a venture that developed and marketed fractional ownership and residential products.
In 2008, we purchased our partners interest in that joint venture together with additional land. Cash consideration for this transaction totaled $42 million and we acquired assets and liabilities totaling $80 million and $38 million,
respectively, on the date of purchase. In 2008, we also purchased real estate for a timeshare project for a total purchase price of approximately $63 million. Cash consideration totaled approximately $39 million, and non-current liabilities recorded
as a result of this transaction were $24 million. In addition, in 2008, we purchased real estate for another timeshare project for cash consideration of $47 million. Also in 2008, we purchased units in an existing building for our timeshare
operations for cash consideration of approximately $14 million. We also purchased real estate for another timeshare project for $28 million. Cash consideration totaled approximately $27 million, and we acquired assets and liabilities totaling $28
million and $1 million, respectively, on the date of purchase. 2008 Dispositions In 2008, we sold, at book value, two limited-service properties and two land parcels for cash proceeds of $33 million, and we received a
$22 million equity interest in the entity that purchased one of the land parcels. We accounted for each of the sales under the full accrual method in accordance with FAS No66 and each property will continue to operate under our brands
pursuant to management or franchise agreements. Also, in 2008, we sold our interest in an entity that leases four hotels. In conjunction with that transaction, we received cash proceeds totaling $5 million, and the sales price of the investment
approximated its book value. 2007 Acquisitions During 2007, we acquired one full-service property, one limited-service property, and one extended-stay property for cash consideration of
$199 million. These three properties were acquired in conjunction with a land assemblage for a large hotel complex that is still in the formative development stage. In addition, we acquired certain land parcels in 2007 for cash consideration of $52
million. Also during 2007, we acquired the fee simple interest in the improvements of three properties and the leasehold interest in the ground underlying the three properties for cash consideration of $58 million. The purchase included one
full-service property and two limited-service properties, which were each sold later in the same year. 
97 Table of Contents
During the first half of 2007, we were party to a venture that developed and marketed
fractional ownership and residential interests. In the second half of 2007, we purchased our partners interest in the joint venture for $6 million. In conjunction with that transaction, we acquired assets and liabilities totaling $90 million
and $84 million, respectively, on the date of the purchase. During the first half of 2007, we were party to another venture that was established to develop and market timeshare and residential interests. In the second half of 2007, we purchased our
partners interest in that joint venture, and concurrent with this transaction, we purchased additional land and assets from our partner as well. Aggregate cash and notes payable issued for these transactions totaled $106 million, and we
acquired assets and liabilities totaling $182 million and $76 million, respectively, on the date of purchase. 2007 Dispositions 
In 2007, we sold nine properties for cash proceeds of $601 million and recognized gains totaling $24 million. We continue
to operate eight of the nine properties under long-term agreements. We sold two parcels of land for $55 million in cash proceeds that were under development and recognized a gain of $2 million. We also sold the fee simple interest in the
improvements of three properties and the leasehold interest in the ground underlying the three properties, initially acquired in early 2007, for book value and received $58 million in cash proceeds. We continue to manage the properties under
long-term agreements. We accounted for each of the foregoing sales under the full accrual method in accordance with FAS No66. During the year, we also sold our interests in five joint ventures for cash proceeds of $30 million and recognized
gains totaling $13 million. We had other asset sales during the year, which generated proceeds totaling $1 million. Cash flows totaling $745 million for all the preceding dispositions in 2007 are reflected in the Dispositions line in our
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In 2007, we also sold land that was under development. Due to a contingency in the
sales contract, we accounted for this sale under the deposit method of FAS No66. Accordingly, the cash proceeds, totaling $90 million, were reflected in Other investing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In
2008, the contingency was resolved and we recorded a gain of $1 million. 2006 Acquisitions During 2006, we acquired one full-service property for $130 million including aggregate cash consideration of $46 million plus the
assumption of debt. In addition we acquired three other full-service properties for aggregate cash consideration of $134 million. We sold each of the four properties to third-party owners during the 2007 fiscal year. 2006 Dispositions In
2006 we sold our interest in the 50/50 joint venture with Whitbread PLC Whitbread, which held 46 hotels consisting of more than 8,000 rooms and we received approximately $164 million in cash, net of transaction costs, which was
approximately equal to the investments book value. We continue to manage the hotels under the Marriott Hotels Resorts and Renaissance Hotels Resorts brands. We also sold our minority interest in five other joint ventures
during 2006 for cash proceeds of $64 million and recognized gains of $43 million. Additionally, one cost method investee redeemed the preferred stock we held for $81 million in cash consideration and we recognized income of $25 million on the
redemption. During 2006 we also sold 10 full-service properties for cash proceeds of $487 million and recognized gains
totaling $14 million. We accounted for each of the sales under the full accrual method in accordance with FAS No66 and continue to operate eight of the properties under long-term management agreements. The sold properties included
eight properties purchased in 2005 from CTF Holdings Ltd. and certain of its affiliates collectively CTF. For additional information regarding the CTF transaction, see the 2005 Acquisitions caption in Footnote No8,
Acquisitions and Dispositions, in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Prior to the sale of one property, we reclassified balances associated with that property in conformity with other held and used properties, in the first
half of 2006 as the property was not expected to be sold within one year of its classification as held for sale. In conjunction with that reclassification, we recorded depreciation expense of $2 million in the first half of 2006 that
would have been recognized had the asset been continuously classified as held and used. Cash proceeds of $26 million for one hotel sold in 2006 are not reflected in the disposition proceeds of $487 million, as the proceeds were initially
recorded as a deposit because of a contingency, and impacted the Other investing activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows rather than Dispositions. The contingency was subsequently resolved and sale
accounting was achieved in 2006. Other asset sales generated cash proceeds of $2 million. Late in 2006, we sold a 75
percent interest in a joint venture to a third party for its book value of $14 million. At the time of the sale, the joint ventures only asset was a parcel of land. In conjunction with the sale, we made a $25 million bridge loan to the joint
venture, which matured in early 2007. Following the guidance found in EITF 
98 Table of Contents
98-8, Accounting for Transfers of Investments That Are in Substance Real Estate, and FAS No66 due to our continuing involvement with the
joint venture, we consolidated the joint venture for the period of time that the bridge loan was outstanding. The bridge loan was subsequently repaid and we account for our remaining interest in the joint venture under the equity method as required
by APB Opinion No18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. In 1988, the
Company as landlord, entered into a 59-year ground lease with a lessee for land that was improved with a hotel that is owned by the lessee. The hotel was previously branded a Marriott property. The lease contained contractual rental increases over
the term of the lease and annual ground rent on the land totaled approximately $5 million in 2006. The lease also contained a provision that permitted the lessee, under certain circumstances, to purchase the land for a fixed price. We and the lessee
had various discussions in 2006 concerning the land as well as the hotel. During the 2006 second quarter, it became probable that none of the proposed transactions were acceptable to both parties and the lessee indicated its intent to exercise its
option to purchase the land. Accordingly, in the 2006 second quarter, we reclassified the land from the Property and equipment caption in our Consolidated Balance Sheets to the Assets held for sale caption and recorded a $37
million non-cash charge to adjust the carrying amount to net realizable value. We completed the sale of the land, at book value, to the lessee in 2007 and this transaction is reflected in the figures noted earlier for dispositions in 2007.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS The
following table details the composition of our goodwill and other intangible assets at year-end 2008 and year-end 2007.  in millions
2008 2007 Contract acquisition costs and other 1,004 899 Accumulated amortization 294 264 710 635 Goodwill 1,003 1,049 Accumulated amortization 128 128 875 921 We capitalize costs incurred to acquire management, franchise, and license
agreements that are both direct and incremental. We amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the agreements, ranging from 15 to 30 years. We evaluate the carrying values of intangible assets for impairment under the
provisions of FAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Amortization expense totaled $35 million for each of 2008 and 2007 and $33 million in 2006. Our estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five
fiscal years is as follows: $29 million for 2009; $29 million for 2010; $28 million for 2011; $28 million for 2012; and $28 million for 2013. In 2008, following the guidance found in EITF 93-7, Uncertainties Related to Income Taxes in a
Purchase Business Combination, we recorded a net $46 million reduction of goodwill and a corresponding change to the related net deferred tax liability due to the resolution of tax-related matters and a change in managements estimate of
tax basis related to the purchase method of accounting for the Renaissance brand acquisition in 1997.  11.
NOTES RECEIVABLE The following

Accounts and notes receivable in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, including $81 million and $68 million, as of year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, respectively, related to Loans to timeshare owners. Notes receivable at year-end 2008 were due to us as follows: $96 million in 2009; $156 million in 2010; $72 million in 2011; $83 million
in 2012; $59 million in 2013; and $460 million thereafter. The 2008 notes 
99 Table of Contents
receivable balance is net of unamortized discounts totaling $21 million. The 2007 notes receivable balance is net of unamortized discounts totaling $25
million. Gains from the sale of notes receivable totaled approximately $16 million, $82 million, and $79 million during 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Lodging Senior Loans and Lodging Mezzanine and Other Loans We reflect interest income associated with Lodging senior loans and Lodging mezzanine and other loans in the
Interest income caption in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. For financial statement purposes we do not accrue interest on Lodging senior loans and Lodging mezzanine and other loans that are
impaired. At year-end 2008, our recorded investment in impaired Lodging senior loans and Lodging mezzanine and other loans was $157 million. We had a $113 million notes receivable reserve representing an allowance for credit
losses, leaving $44 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. At year-end 2007, our recorded investment in impaired Lodging senior loans and Lodging mezzanine and other
loans was $112 million and we had a $92 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $20 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. During 2008 and 2007, our average investment in
impaired loans totaled $135 million and $102 million, respectively. The following table summarizes the activity related to

interest rates associated with these loans ranged from zero to 195 percent. We reflect interest income associated with Loans to timeshare owners of $68 million, $50 million, and $41 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income in the Timeshare sales and services revenue caption. We do not record accrued interest on Loans to timeshare owners that are over 90 days past due. Our recorded investment in
Loans to timeshare owners on nonaccrual status at year-end 2008 and year-end 2007 totaled $74 million and $59 million, respectively. We established the reserve for Loans to timeshare owners notes receivable in 2006 in
conjunction with the adoption of SOP 04-2.

ASSET SECURITIZATIONS We
periodically sell, without recourse, through special purpose entities, notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional products. We continue to service the notes and transfer all
proceeds collected to special purpose entities. We retain servicing assets and other interests in the notes and account for these assets and interests as residual interests. The interests are limited to the present value of cash available after
paying financing expenses and program fees and absorbing credit losses. The executed transactions typically include minimal cash reserves established at time of sale as well as default and delinquency triggers, which are monitored on a monthly
basis. These special purpose entities are specifically excluded from the scope of FIN 46R. As such, we have not assessed if we would be deemed the primary beneficiary of these entities and thus be required to consolidated them. Prior to the start
of the 2007 fiscal year, we measured servicing assets at the date of sale at their allocated previous carrying amount based on relative fair value, classified those assets as held to maturity under the provisions of FAS No115, and recorded
those assets at amortized cost. On December30, 2006, the first day of fiscal year 2007, we adopted FAS No156.
In conjunction with the adoption of FAS No156, we elected to subsequently measure our servicing assets using the fair value method. Under the fair value method, we carry servicing assets on the balance sheet at fair value, and report the
changes in fair value, primarily due to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions and to the collection or realization of expected cash flows, in earnings in the period in which the change occurs. To determine the fair value of servicing assets, we use a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net
servicing income, which is based on the monthly fee we receive for servicing the securitized notes. We use market assumptions in the valuation model, including estimates of prepayment speeds, default rates, and discount rates. We have inherent risk
for changes in the fair value of the servicing asset but do not deem the risk significant and therefore, do not use other financial instruments to mitigate this risk. Effective December30, 2006, upon the remeasurement of our servicing assets at fair value, we recorded a cumulative-effect
adjustment to the 2007 beginning balance of retained earnings of $1 million after-tax $2 million pretax in our Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity. Accordingly, servicing assets totaled $11 million at year-end 2006 and $13 million
on the first day of fiscal year 2007. At year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, servicing assets totaled $12 million and $15 million, respectively. The table below reconciles the servicing assets balance at year-end 2006, to the beginning balance on December30, 2006.  in millions

Principally represents changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows over time and changes in fair value
due to changes in key variables listed below. Contractually specified servicing fees, late fees, and
ancillary fees earned for 2008, 2007, and 2006 totaled $6 million, $6 million, and $5 million, respectively, and were reflected within the changes in fair value to the servicing assets noted above. In 2008, 2007, and 2006, we sold notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval
and fractional ownership products of $300 million, $520 million, and $530 million, respectively. The 2008, 2007, and 2006 note sales were made to newly formed trusts that, on the same day, issued $246 million, $520 million, and $530 million of the
trusts notes, respectively. In connection with the sale of the notes receivable, we received net proceeds of $237 million in 2008, $515 million in 2007, and $508 million in 2006. We have included gains from the sales of timeshare notes
receivable totaling $16 million, net of $12 million of hedge ineffectiveness, in 2008, $81 million in 2007, and $77 million in 2006 within the Timeshare sales and services revenue caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these special purpose entities is the value of our
residual interests and servicing assets. We had residual interests of $221 million and $238 million, respectively, at
year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, which are recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as other long-term receivables of $134 million and $157 million, respectively, and other current assets of $87 million and $81 million, respectively.
Cash flows between us and third-party purchasers during 2008, 2007, and 2006, were as follows: net proceeds to us from new
timeshare note sales of $237 million, $515 million, and $508 million, respectively; repurchases by us of defaulted loans over 150 days overdue of $56 million, $30 million, and $24 million, respectively; repurchases by us of other loans in 2006 of
$31 million; servicing fees received by us of $6 million, $6 million, and $5 million, respectively; and cash flows received from our retained interests of $96 million, $100 million, and $91 million, respectively. At year-end 2008, $1,181 million of principal remained outstanding in 12 special purpose entities formed in connection with our timeshare
note sales. Delinquencies of more than 90 days at year-end 2008 amounted to $12 million. The impact to us from delinquencies is limited to our residual interests, which we value based on a discounted cash flow model, as discussed in Footnote
No5, Fair Value Measurements. In cases where we choose to repurchase defaulted loans, we have been able to resell timeshare units underlying the defaulted loans without incurring material losses. See our discussion regarding asset securitizations in the Cash from Operations caption of the Liquidity and Capital
Resources section of this report and, also, see Footnote No5, Fair Value Measurements, in this report for further discussion of our servicing assets and residual interests. Due to the deterioration in the credit markets during the fourth quarter of 2008, we decided to postpone our planned note sale until
2009.

LONG-TERM DEBT Our long-term debt
at year-end 2008 and year-end 2007 consisted of the following:  in millions
2008 2007 Senior Notes Series C, interest rate of 7875%, face amount of $76, maturing September15, 2009 effective interest rate of 8022 76 76 Series E, matured January15, 2008 91 Series F, interest rate of 4625%, face amount of $348, maturing June15, 2012 effective interest rate of 5014 347 349 Series G, interest rate of 5810%, face amount of $368, maturing November10, 2015 effective interest rate of 6620 349 402 Series H, interest rate of 6200%, face amount of $314, maturing June15, 2016 effective interest rate of 6311 314 349 Series I, interest rate of 6375%, face amount of $338, maturing June15, 2017 effective interest rate of 6454 335 346 Series J, interest rate of 5625%, face amount of $400, maturing February15, 2013 effective interest rate of 5709 397 397 Commercial paper 585 $25B Credit Facility, average interest rate of 2412% at January2, 2009 969 Other 308 370 3,095 2,965 Less current portion 120 175 2,975 2,790 As of year-end 2008, all debt was unsecured. We are party to a multicurrency revolving credit agreement the Credit Facility that provides for borrowings and letters of
credit and has supported our commercial paper program. The Credit Facility provides for $25 billion of aggregate borrowings at any one time, and expires on May14, 2012. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the London
Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus a fixed spread. Additionally, we pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. LCPI, a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which filed for bankruptcy on October5, 2008, is one of the lenders under the Credit Facility, with a total
aggregate funding commitment of $96 million 38 percent of the $25 billion in total commitments. LCPI did not fund its share of our fourth quarter 2008 draws under the Credit Facility, and we have no reason to expect that it will do so in the
future. Accordingly, the total current effective size of the Credit Facility is approximately $24 billion. Until early in
the 2008 fourth quarter, we regularly issued short-term commercial paper primarily in the United States and, to a much lesser extent, in Europe. Our commercial paper issuances are subject to the then-current demand for our commercial paper in each
of these markets, as we do not have purchase commitments from buyers. Disruptions in the financial markets in September 2008 significantly reduced liquidity in the commercial paper market. Accordingly, in September 2008, we borrowed under the Credit
Facility to fund anticipated short-term commercial paper maturities and, to a lesser extent, other general corporate needs, including working capital and capital expenditures, and suspended issuing commercial paper. All of our previously issued
commercial paper has matured and been repaid. We anticipate issuing commercial paper when that market stabilizes and issuances can be made on favorable terms. We classify commercial paper as long-term debt based on our ability and intent to
refinance it on a long-term basis. We reserve unused capacity under our Credit Facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings
mature. Fluctuations in the commercial paper market have not affected our liquidity and we do not expect them to do so in the future, given our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility.

Although we are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties, we depend on
capital to buy, develop, and improve hotels and also to develop timeshare properties. Events over the past several months, including recent failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies, have made the capital markets
increasingly volatile. See the Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities discussion in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this report for additional information regarding our Credit Facility. In early 2008, we made a $94 million cash payment of principal and interest to retire, at maturity, all of our outstanding Series E
Senior Notes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we repurchased $109 million of our Senior Notes in the open market, across multiple series. We recorded a gain of $28 million for the debt extinguishment representing the difference between the acquired
debts purchase price of $77 million and its carrying amount of $105 million. The weighted average interest rate on the senior debt that was paid down in 2008 was 64 percent. Aggregate debt maturities at year-end 2008 were: $120 million in 2009; $71 million in 2010; $22 million in 2011; $1,327 million in 2012 409 million in 2013; and $1,146 million thereafter. Cash paid for interest, net of amounts capitalized, was $110 million
in 2008, $115 million in 2007, and $73 million in 2006.  14.
SELF-INSURANCE RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES The activity in the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses is summarized as follows:  in millions

and $34 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, as a result of changes in estimates from insured events of the prior years due to changes in underwriting experience and frequency and severity trends. The year-end 2008 self-insurance reserve of $296
million is comprised of a current portion of $92 million and long-term portion of $204 million. The year-end 2007 self-insurance reserve of $274 million is comprised of a current portion of $92 million and long-term portion of $182 million.

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY Eight
hundred million shares of our ClassA Common Stock, with a par value of $01 per share, are authorized, and 10million shares of preferred stock, without par value, are authorized. As of year-end 2008, there were 3496million shares
of our ClassA Common Stock outstanding and no shares of our preferred stock were outstanding. Accumulated other
comprehensive loss of $15 million at year-end 2008 primarily consisted of losses totaling $10 million associated with available-for-sale securities and losses totaling $13 million associated with foreign currency translation adjustments, partially
offset by net gains of $8 million associated with interest rate swap agreement cash flow hedges. Accumulated other comprehensive income of $51 million at year-end 2007 primarily consisted of gains totaling $9 million associated with
available-for-sale securities and gains totaling $46 million associated with foreign currency translation adjustments, partially offset by net losses of $4 million associated with interest rate swap agreement cash flow hedges.

discounted at risk-adjusted rates. We determine valuations for long-term debt and other long-term liabilities based on quoted market prices or expected future payments discounted at risk-adjusted rates.  17.
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS We use
derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or
speculative purposes. During 2007, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage the volatility of the U.S.
Treasury component of the interest rate risk associated with the forecasted issuance of our Series I and Series J Senior Notes. During 2006, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage the volatility of the U.S. Treasury component of
the interest rate risk associated with the forecasted issuance of our Series H Notes. All three swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under FAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities FAS
No133 and were terminated upon pricing of the notes. All three swaps were highly effective in offsetting fluctuations in the U.S. Treasury component. Thus, there was no net gain or loss reported in earnings during 2007, or 2006. The
net losses for these swaps were $4 million in 2007 associated with the Series I and Series J Senior Notes, and zero in 2006 associated with the Series H notes. The net losses were recorded in other comprehensive income and are being amortized to
interest expense using the interest method over the life of the notes. At year-end 2008, we had four outstanding interest
rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our timeshare note sales. Historically, we were required by purchasers and/or rating agencies to utilize interest rate swaps to
protect the excess spread within our sold note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps is $111 million, and they expire through 2022. These swaps are not accounted for as hedges under FAS No133. The fair value of the swaps was a net
liability of $2 million at year-end 2008 and a net asset of $2 million at year-end 2007. For the outstanding interest rate swaps, we recorded a $4 million net loss during 2008, a $3 million net loss during 2007, and a $1 million net loss during
2006. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with
forecasted timeshare note sales. During 2008, eleven swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under FAS No133. The swaps were highly effective in offsetting interest rate fluctuations through the third quarter. In 2008, we terminated nine of
those eleven swaps and recognized a $6 million loss in Timeshare sales and services revenue. During the fourth quarter, two of the hedges became ineffective and we recorded a $12 million charge in Timeshare sales and services revenue. The aggregate
notional amount of the remaining two swaps is $149 million at year-end 2008 and they expire in 2012. The fair value of the remaining two swaps was a net liability of $13 million at year-end 2008. During 2007, five swaps were designated as cash flow
hedges under FAS No133 and were highly effective in offsetting interest rate fluctuations. The amount of the ineffectiveness was immaterial. In 2007, we terminated two of those five swaps and recognized no gain or loss from the sales of
Timeshare segment notes receivable. The fair value of the remaining three swaps was a net liability of $7 million at year-end 2007. For the outstanding interest rate swaps, we recorded in 2007 a $7 million net loss in other comprehensive income.
During 2006, two swaps the 2006 swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under FAS No133 and were highly effective in offsetting interest rate fluctuations. In 2006, we terminated the 2006 swaps and recognized a net gain of $1
million in the gains from the sales of Timeshare segment notes receivable. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we entered into
forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain monetary assets. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amount of the contracts 
105 Table of Contents
was $190 million at year-end 2008 and they expire in 2009. The forward exchange contracts do not qualify as hedges in accordance with FAS No133. The
fair value of the forward contracts to hedge monetary assets was zero at year-end 2008 and an asset of $2 million at year-end 2007. We recorded a $7 million gain during 2008, a $10 million loss during 2007, and a $34 million loss in 2006, relating
to these forward foreign exchange contracts. The net gains and losses for all years were recorded as general, administrative, and other expense and were offset by income and losses recorded from translating the related monetary assets denominated in
foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. During 2007 and 2006, we entered into foreign exchange option contracts to hedge the
potential volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with variations in foreign exchange rates. These contracts have terms of less than one year and are classified as cash flow hedges. Changes in their fair values are recorded as a component
of other comprehensive income. The fair value of the option contracts was approximately $1 million at year-end 2007. During 2008, we recognized a $1 million loss related to the termination of contracts that we entered into during prior years. The
hedges were highly effective and there was no net gain or loss reported in earnings for 2007 and 2006 due to ineffectiveness. During 2008 and 2007, we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted transactions for contracts and fees denominated in foreign currencies. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the contracts was
$89 million at year-end 2008. These contracts have terms of less than three years and are classified as cash flow hedges. Changes in their fair value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The fair value of the forward contracts
was $4 million at year-end 2008 and zero at year-end 2007. The hedges were highly effective and there was no gain or loss, impacting our general, administrative, and other expenses, reported in earnings for 2008 or 2007 due to ineffectiveness.
During 2008, we recorded a $1 million loss, impacting general, administrative, and other expenses, related to points paid to enter into these contracts. As of year-end 2008, the deferred gains and losses on existing contracts accumulated in other
comprehensive income that we expect to reclassify into earnings over future periods is $6 million. During 2008, 2007, and
2006, we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency exchange rate volatility associated with certain investments in foreign operations. The contracts offset the gains and losses associated with translation adjustments for
various investments in foreign operations. Certain contracts were designated as hedges in the net investment of a foreign operation under FAS No133. These hedges were highly effective and resulted in a net gain of $1 million for 2008, a net
loss of $1 million for 2007, and no net gain or loss for 2006 in the foreign currency translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income. Due to contract terminations in 2008, $1 million that was originally recorded in other comprehensive
income was recognized through earnings as a loss. The investments remaining at year-end 2008 had an aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amount of $15 million and a fair value of zero. No contracts remained at year-end 2007. One contract
remained at year-end 2006, which had an aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amount of $43 million and a fair value of zero. Certain other contracts did not qualify as hedges under FAS No133 and resulted in no gain or loss for 2007 and
a loss of $17 million for 2006, impacting our general, administrative, and other expenses. During 2007 and 2006, in
response to high oil prices and uncertainty surrounding the potential phase out of tax credits, we entered into oil price hedges in conjunction with our synthetic fuel operation. These hedges do not qualify as cash flow hedges under FAS
No133. Therefore, changes in the fair values of these instruments are marked-to-market through interest income at each reporting period. Correspondingly, we recorded a net loss of $8 million during 2007 and a net loss of $2 million during
2006. At year-end 2007, hedges with a total fair value of $4 million remained outstanding. During 2003, we entered into an
interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating rate. The
aggregate notional amount of the swap is $92 million and it matures in 2010. The swap is classified as a fair value hedge under FAS No133 and we recognize the change in the fair value of the swap, as well as the change in the fair value of
the underlying note receivable, in interest income. The fair value of the swap was a $5 million liability at year-end 2008, a $2 million liability at year-end 2007, and a $1 million asset at year-end 2006. The hedge is highly effective and,
therefore, no net gain or loss was reported during 2008, 2007, and 2006.

CONTINGENCIES Guarantees We issue guarantees to certain lenders and hotel owners primarily to obtain long-term management contracts. The guarantees generally have
a stated maximum amount of funding and a term of three to 10 years. The terms of guarantees to lenders generally require us to fund if cash flows from hotel operations are inadequate to cover annual debt service or to repay the loan at the end of
the term. The terms of the guarantees to hotel owners generally require us to fund if the hotels do not attain specified levels of operating profit. Guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel owners are generally recoverable as loans repayable to us
out of future hotel cash flows and/or proceeds from the sale of hotels. We also enter into project completion guarantees with certain lenders in conjunction with hotels and Timeshare segment properties that we or our joint venture partners are
building. The maximum potential amount of future fundings for guarantees where we are the primary obligor and the carrying
amount of the liability for expected future fundings at year-end 2008, are as follows:  $ in millions Guarantee Type
MaximumPotentialAmount of FutureFundings
LiabilityforExpectedFuture Fundings atYear-End 2008
Debt service 38 1
Operating profit 165 27
Other 95 7 Total guarantees where we are the primary obligor 298 35 The liability for expected future fundings at year-end 2008, is included in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: $3 million in the Other payables and accruals line item and $32 million in the Other long-term liabilities line item. Our guarantees of $298 million listed in the preceding table include $33 million of operating profit guarantees that will not be in
effect until the underlying properties open and we begin to operate the properties, along with $3 million of debt service guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying debt has been funded. The guarantees of $298 million in the preceding table do not include $206 million of guarantees that we anticipate will expire in the
years 2011 through 2013, related to Senior Living Services lease obligations totaling $145 million and lifecare bonds of $61 million for which we are secondarily liable. Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. Sunrise is the primary obligor of the
leases and $9 million of the lifecare bonds, and CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. CNL, which subsequently merged with Health Care Property Investors, Inc., is the primary obligor of $50 million of the lifecare bonds. Five Star is the
primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to our sale of the Senior Living Services business in 2003, these preexisting guarantees were guarantees by us of obligations of consolidated Senior Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise
and CNL have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. While we currently do not expect to fund under the guarantees, according to recent SEC filings made by
Sunrise there has been a significant deterioration in Sunrises financial position and access to liquidity; accordingly, Sunrises continued ability to meet these guarantee obligations cannot be assured. The table also does not include lease obligations for which we became secondarily liable when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group
N.V. in 1997, consisting of annual rent payments of approximately $6 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term of approximately $67 million. Most of these obligations expire at the end of 2023. CTF Holdings Ltd.
CTF had originally made available 35million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund under such guarantees approximately 7million [$10 million] remained at year-end 2008. As CTF obtains
releases from the landlords and these hotels exit the system, our contingent liability exposure of approximately $67 million will decline. Since the time we assumed these guarantees, we have not funded any amounts and we do not expect to fund any
amounts under these guarantees in the future. In addition to the guarantees noted in the preceding table , we have
provided a project completion guarantee to a lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $586 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture through contributions from the partners, and
we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 34 percent. We do not expect to fund under the guarantee. At year-end 2008, the carrying value of the liabilities
associated with this project completion guarantee was $6 million. We have provided a project completion guarantee to another lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $460 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project
will be satisfied by the joint venture through contributions from the partners, and we are liable on a several basis with our 
107 Table of Contents
partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 20 percent. We do not expect to fund under the guarantee. At year-end
2008, the carrying value of the liabilities associated with this project completion guarantee was $3 million. In addition
to the guarantees described in the preceding paragraphs, in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for
loss, liability, or damage occurring as a result of the actions of the other joint venture owner or our own actions. Commitments and
Letters of Credit In addition to the guarantees noted previously, as of year-end 2008, we had extended approximately
$10 million of loan commitments to owners of lodging properties, under which we expect to fund approximately $8 million, which expire within one year. We do not expect to fund the remaining $2 million of commitments, which expire in one year.
At year-end 2008, we also had commitments to invest up to $44 million of equity for minority interests in partnerships
that plan to purchase North American full-service and limited-service properties or purchase or develop hotel-anchored mixed-use real estate projects, which expire as follows: $34 million within three years; and $10 million after three years. Of the
$44 million in commitments, we expect to fund $29 million within one to two years and $15 million within three years. In addition, as of year-end 2008, we had commitments, with no expiration date, to fund up to $25 million in joint ventures for
development of new properties of which we expect to fund $13 million within one year and $12 million in one to two years. Also, as of year-end 2008, we had a commitment, with no expiration date, to invest up to $8 million in a joint venture of which
we have funded $1 million and have $7 million remaining that we do not expect to fund. And, as of year-end 2008, we had a commitment to invest up to $28 million 20 million in a joint venture in which we are a partner. We do not expect to
fund under this commitment. At year-end 2008, we had $126 million of letters of credit outstanding, the majority of which
related to our self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued as of year-end 2008, totaled $465 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our lodging operations, including our Timeshare segment and
self-insurance programs. Investment in Leveraged Lease Historically, we had a $23 million investment in an aircraft leveraged lease with Delta Air Lines, Inc. Delta Airlines,
which we acquired in 1994. The gross investment was comprised of rentals receivable and the residual value of the aircraft offset by unearned income. On September14, 2005, Delta Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code and informed us that it wished to restructure the lease. As a result, our investment was impaired and we had recorded pretax charges of approximately $17 million in 2005 and $1 million in 2006. We recorded an additional $5
million loss related to this investment in fiscal 2007, and have no remaining exposure.  19.

108 Table of Contents
In addition to the segments above, in 2007, we exited the synthetic fuel business, which was formerly a
separate segment but which we now report under discontinued operations. We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the
results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense, income taxes, or indirect general, administrative, and other expenses. With the exception of the Timeshare segment, we do not allocate interest income to our segments.
Because note sales are an integral part of the Timeshare segment, we include note sale gains in our Timeshare segment results. We also include interest income associated with Timeshare segment notes in our Timeshare segment results because financing
sales are an integral part of that segments business. Additionally, we allocate other gains or losses, equity in earnings or losses from our joint ventures, divisional general, administrative, and other expenses, and minority interests in
income or losses of consolidated subsidiaries to each of our segments. Other unallocated corporate represents that portion of our revenues, general, administrative, and other expenses, equity in earnings or losses, and other gains or
losses that are not allocable to our segments. We aggregate the brands presented within our North American Full-Service, North American
Limited-Service, International, Luxury, and Timeshare segments considering their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, distribution channels, the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment and
our organizational and management reporting structure. Revenues  in millions

Approximately 89 percent for each of 2008 and 2007 and 90 percent for 2006 of the selling expenses are related to our Timeshare segment. The consolidated financial statements include the following related to operations located outside the United States which are predominately related to
our International lodging segment: Revenues of $2,230 million in 2008, $2,287 million in 2007, and $1,869 million in 2006; segment financial results of $253 million in 2008 13 percent from Europe, 36 percent from the Americas excluding the United
States, 23 percent from Asia, 12 percent from the United Kingdom, 13 percent from the Middle East and Africa, and 3 percent from Australia, $341 million in 2007, and $298 million in 2006; and fixed assets of $314 million in 2008 and $257 million in
2007. At year-end 2008 and at year-end 2007, fixed assets located outside the United States are included within the Property and equipment caption in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. No individual country, other than the United States,
constitutes a material portion of our revenues, financial results or fixed assets. We estimate that, for the 20-year period from 2009
through 2028, the cost of completing improvements and currently planned amenities for our owned timeshare properties will be approximately $35 billion.

RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND OTHER CHARGES During the
latter part of 2008, we experienced a significant decline in demand for hotel rooms both domestically and internationally as a result, in part, of the recent failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies in the fourth
quarter of 2008 and the dramatic downturn in the economy. Our capital intensive Timeshare business was also hurt both domestically and internationally by the downturn in market conditions and particularly the significant deterioration in the credit
markets, which resulted in our decision not to complete a note sale in the fourth quarter of 2008. These declines resulted in reduced management and franchise fees, cancellation of development projects, reduced timeshare contract sales, and
anticipated losses under guarantees and loans. We responded by implementing certain company-wide cost-saving measures with individual company segments and corporate departments implementing further cost saving measures. Upper-level management
responsible for the Timeshare segment, hotel operations, development, and above-property level management of the various corporate departments and brand teams individually led these decentralized management initiatives. The various initiatives
resulted in aggregate restructuring costs of $55 million that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. We also incurred other charges, including charges for guarantees and reserves for loan losses, and inventory write-downs on Timeshare inventory,
reserves on accounts receivable, contract cancellation allowances, a charge related to the valuation of Timeshare residual interests, a charge associated with hedge ineffectiveness related to Timeshare note sale hedges, and asset impairments and
other charges, detailed further in Other Charges. As part of the restructuring efforts in our Timeshare segment, we reduced
and consolidated sales channels in the United States and closed down certain operations in Europe. We recorded Timeshare restructuring costs of $28 million in the 2008 fourth quarter, including: 1$14 million in severance costs; 2$5
million in facilities exit costs, primarily associated with noncancelable lease costs in excess of estimated sublease income arising from the reduction in personnel; and 3$9 million related to the write-off of capitalized costs relating to
development projects no longer deemed viable. We expect to complete this restructuring by year-end 2009. As part of the hotel development
restructuring efforts across several of our Lodging segments, we discontinued certain development projects that required our investment. We recorded restructuring costs in the 2008 fourth quarter of $24 million, including: 1$2 million in
severance costs; and 2$22 million related to the write-off of capitalized costs relating to development projects that we discontinued, including capitalized costs related to owned development of Renaissance ClubSport. We expect to complete
this restructuring by year-end 2009. We also implemented restructuring initiatives by reducing above-property level lodging management
personnel and corporate overhead. We incurred 2008 fourth quarter restructuring costs of $3 million primarily reflecting severance costs. We expect to complete this restructuring by year-end 2009. We have provided detailed information related to these restructuring costs and other charges below. Restructuring Costs Severance
These various restructuring initiatives resulted in an overall reduction of 1,021 employees the majority of whom were terminated by
January2, 2009 across the Company. We recorded a total workforce reduction charge of $19 million related primarily to severance and fringe benefits, which consisted of $14 million for the Timeshare segment, $2 million related to hotel
development, and $3 million related to above-property level lodging management and corporate overhead. The charge does not reflect amounts billed out separately to owners for property-level severance costs. We also delayed filling vacant positions
and reduced staff hours. In connection with these initiatives, we expect to incur an additional $3 million to $4 million related to severance and fringe benefits in 2009 for the Timeshare segment. Facilities Exit Costs As a result of
workforce reductions and delays in filling vacant positions that were part of the Timeshare segment restructuring, we ceased using certain leased facilities. We recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $5 million associated with these
facilities, primarily related to noncancelable lease costs in excess of estimated sublease income. In connection with these initiatives, in 2009, we expect to incur an additional $2 million to $3 million related to ceasing use of additional
noncancelable leases. 
112 Table of Contents
Development Cancellations We sometimes incur certain costs associated with the development of hotel and timeshare properties, including legal costs, the cost of
land, and planning and design costs. We capitalize these costs as incurred and they become part of the cost basis of the property once it is developed. As a result of the sharp downturn in the economy, we decided to discontinue certain development
projects that required our investment, including our Renaissance ClubSport real estate development activities. These cancellations do not impact the two Renaissance ClubSport properties that are currently open. As a result of these development
cancellations, we expensed $31 million of previously capitalized costs, which consisted of $9 million of costs for the Timeshare segment and $22 million of costs related to hotel development. We do not currently expect to expense any additional
capitalized costs in 2009 in connection with these restructuring initiatives. Other Charges Charges for Guarantees and Reserves for Loan Losses We sometimes issue guarantees to lenders and other third parties in connection with some financing transactions and other obligations. We also advance loans to some owners of properties that we manage. As a result of
the downturn in the economy, certain hotels have experienced significant declines in profitability and the owners may not be able to meet debt service obligations to us, or in some cases, to third-party lending institutions. In addition, we expect
profit levels at a few hotels to drop below guaranteed levels. As a result, based on cash flow projections, we expect to fund under some of our guarantees, which we do not deem recoverable, and we expect that one of the loans made by us will not be
repaid according to its original terms. Due to the expected fundings under guarantees that we deemed nonrecoverable, we recorded charges of $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 in the General, administrative, and other expenses
caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Due to the expected loan loss, we recorded a charge of $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 in the Provision for loan losses caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Timeshare Inventory Write-downs As a result of terminating certain phases of timeshare development in Europe, we recorded an inventory write-down of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. We recorded this charge in the
Timeshare-direct caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Accounts Receivable-Bad Debts In the fourth quarter of 2008, we reserved $4 million of accounts receivable, which we deemed uncollectible, generally as a result of the
unfavorable hotel operating environment, following an analysis of those accounts. We recorded this charge in the General, administrative, and other expenses caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Timeshare Contract Cancellation Allowances Our financial statements reflect net contract cancellation allowances totaling $12 million recorded in the 2008 fourth quarter in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue and cost previously recorded for
certain projects under the percentage-of-completion method will not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing. We have an equity method investment in one of these projects, and reflected $7 million of the $12 million in the
Equity in earnings caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The remaining net $5 million of contract cancellation allowances consisted of a reduction in revenue, net of adjustments to product costs and other direct costs, and
was recorded in Timeshare sales and services revenue, net of direct costs. Timeshare Residual Interests Valuation The fair market value of our residual interest in timeshare notes sold declined in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily due to an increase
in the market rate of interest at which we discount future cash flows to estimate the fair market value of the retained interests. The increase in the market rate of interest reflects deteriorating economic conditions and disruption in the credit
markets, which significantly increased the borrowing costs to issuers. As a result of this change, we recorded a $32 million charge in Timeshare sales and services caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income to reflect the decrease
in the fair value of these residual interests. Timeshare Hedge Ineffectiveness Given the significant deterioration in the credit markets, we expect that any potential note sale transactions pursued by the Company in
the near term will be materially different from arrangements originally contemplated, 
113 Table of Contents
and accordingly, the sensitivity of a hedge the Company previously entered into to manage interest rate risk associated with forecasted note sales no longer
significantly corresponds to the sensitivity in expected note sale proceeds. Differences include expected legal structures, modifications to priority of cash flow, and higher costs. The change in terms inputs used to determine hedge effectiveness
for Timeshares note sale hedges resulted in the recognition of $12 million in hedge ineffectiveness. We recorded this hedge ineffectiveness as a reduction in note sale gains in the Timeshare sales and services caption in our
Consolidated Statements of Income. Asset Impairments and Other Charges One project that is in development and in which the Company has a joint venture investment was unable to draw on existing financing
commitments as a result of the recent turmoil in the capital markets and the bankruptcy of the projects major lender. As a result, based on our analysis of expected future cash flows, we determined that our investment in that joint venture was
fully impaired, and we recorded an impairment charge of $9 million in the Equity in earnings caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In addition, as a result of the economic downturn and the inability of certain developers to obtain financing, we also recorded write-offs of other assets $12 million related to development costs associated with
projects we no longer deem probable in the General, administrative, and other expenses caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income. We also deemed certain cost method tax investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired because we do not expect to receive any future economic benefit from these investments. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment
charge of $9 million for those investments in the Gains and other income caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Summary of Restructuring Costs and Other Charges The following table is a summary of the restructuring
costs and other charges we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008, as well as our remaining liability at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008 and remaining restructuring costs expected to be incurred in 2009 as part of these restructuring

We anticipate that the remaining liability related to the workforce reduction will be substantially paid
by the end of 2009 for the Timeshare segment, by the end of 2009 for hotel development, and by the end of 2009 for above-property level management. The amounts related to the space reduction and resulting lease expense due to the consolidation of
facilities in the Timeshare segment will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2012. The remaining liability related to expected fundings under guarantees will likely be substantially paid by year-end 2010. The following tables provide

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES In
accordance with FASB Interpretation No46 revised December 2003, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, we analyze our variable interests including loans, guarantees, and equity investments, to determine if the entity that
is party to the variable interest is a variable interest entity. Our analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative reviews. Quantitative analysis is based on the forecasted cash flows of the entity. Qualitative analysis is based on our review
of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision making ability, and financial agreements. Quantitative and qualitative analyses are also used to determine if we must consolidate a variable interest entity as the primary
beneficiary. We have an equity investment in and a loan receivable due from a variable interest entity that develops and
markets fractional ownership and residential interests, and we consolidate the entity as we are the primary beneficiary. The loan we provided to the entity replaced the original senior loan and at year-end 2008 had a balance of $68 million and
accrued interest of $15 million. The loan facility is utilized to fund net cash flow of the variable 
115 Table of Contents
interest entity. The outstanding principal balance increased by $32 million compared to year-end 2007. At year-end 2008, the carrying amount of consolidated
assets included within our Consolidated Balance Sheet that are collateral for the variable interest entitys obligations totaled $103 million and comprised $101 million of real estate held for development, property, equipment, and other
long-term assets, and $2 million of cash. Further, at year-end 2008, the carrying amount of consolidated liabilities included within our Consolidated Balance Sheet relative to this variable interest entity totaled $17 million. The creditors of the
variable interest entity do not have general recourse to our credit. We utilize several special purpose entities to
maintain ownership of real estate in certain jurisdictions in order to facilitate sales within the Asia Pacific Points Club. Although we have no equity ownership in the Club itself, we absorb the variability in the assets of the club to the extent
that inventory has not been sold to the ultimate Club Member. We determined that we were the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities based upon the proportion of variability that we absorb compared to Club Members. At year-end 2007
and 2008, the carrying amount of inventory associated with these variable interest entities was $18 million and $78 million, respectively. The creditors of the special purpose entities do not have general recourse to our credit. In conjunction with the transaction with CTF described more fully in Footnote No9, Acquisitions and Dispositions,
under the caption 2005 Acquisitions in our 2007 Form 10-K, we manage certain hotels on behalf of four tenant entities 100 percent owned by CTF, which lease the hotels from third-party owners. Due to certain provisions in the management
agreements, we account for these contracts as operating leases. At year-end 2008, the number of hotels totaled 14. The entities have minimal equity and minimal assets comprised of hotel working capital. In conjunction with the 2005 transaction, CTF
had placed money in a trust account to cover cash flow shortfalls and to meet rent payments. In turn, we released CTF from their guarantees in connection with these properties. The terms of the trust require that the cash flows for the four tenant
entities be pooled for purposes of making rent payments and determining cash flow shortfalls. At year-end 2008, the trust account held approximately $28 million. The entities are variable interest entities under FIN 46R. We do not consolidate the
entities because we do not bear the majority of the expected losses. We are secondarily liable after exhaustion of funds from the trust account for rent payments for eight of the 14 hotels in the event that there are cash flow shortfalls. Future
minimum lease payments through the end of the lease term for these eight hotels totaled approximately $94 million. In addition, we are also secondarily liable for rent payments of up to an aggregate cap of $37 million for the six other hotels in the
event that there are cash flow shortfalls.  22.
