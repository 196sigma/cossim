The Board of Directors and Stockholders
SanDisk Corporation
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SanDisk
Corporation as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
SanDisk Corporation at December 31, 2001 and 2000 and the consolidated results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

Note 1: Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization and Nature of Operations
SanDisk Corporation the Company was incorporated in Delaware on June 1,
1988, to design, manufacture, and market industry-standard, solid-state mass
storage products using proprietary, high-density flash memory technology. The
Company operates in one segment and serves customers in the consumer
electronics, industrial, communications and highly portable computing markets.
Principal geographic markets for the Company products include the United
States, Japan, Europe and the Far East.
Supplier and Customer Concentrations
A limited number of customers historically have accounted for a substantial
portion of the Company revenues. Sales to our top 10 customers accounted for
approximately 49%, 48%, and 57%, respectively, of our product revenues for the
fiscal years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999. In 2001 and 2000, no
single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. In 1999, revenues
from one customer exceeded 10% of total revenues. Sales of the Company
products will vary as a result of fluctuations in market demand. Further, the
flash data storage markets in which the Company competes are characterized by
rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, declining average
selling prices and rapid technological obsolescence.
Certain of the raw materials used by the Company in the manufacture of its
products are available from a limited number of suppliers. All of the Company
products require silicon wafers. The majority of the Company flash memory
wafers are currently supplied by the Company FlashVision joint venture with
Toshiba. After the restructuring of the FlashVision joint venture, all of the
Company NAND flash memory wafers will be supplied by Toshiba wafer facility
in Yokkaichi, Japan. In the third quarter of 2001, the Company began to purchase
controller wafers from UMC and is continuing development of advanced flash
memory technology utilizing the 015 micron technology design rules at UMC. The
Company is dependent on its foundries to allocate to the Company a portion of
their foundry capacity sufficient to meet the Company needs, to produce wafers
of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver
those wafers to the Company on a timely basis. On occasion, the Company has
experienced difficulties in each of these areas. Under the Company joint
venture agreement with Toshiba, the Company is committed to purchase 50% of
FlashVision wafer output from the Dominion, Virginia fabrication facility
prior to the FlashVision restructuring and from the Yokkaichi fabrication
facility after the restructuring.
Under the terms of the Company wafer supply agreements, the Company is
obligated to provide a monthly rolling forecast of anticipated purchase orders.
Except in limited circumstances and subject to acceptance by the foundries, the
estimates for the first three months of each forecast constitute a binding
commitment and the estimates for the remaining months may not increase or
decrease by more than a certain percentage from the previous month forecast.
These restrictions limit the Company ability to react to significant
fluctuations in demand for its products. As a result, the Company has not been
able to match its purchases of wafers to specific customer orders, and therefore
the Company has taken write downs for potential excess inventory purchased prior
to the receipt of customer orders and may be required to do so in the future.
These adjustments decrease gross margins in the quarter reported and have
resulted, and could in the future result in fluctuations in gross margins on a
quarter to quarter basis. To the extent the Company inaccurately forecasts the
number of wafers required, it may have either a shortage or an excess supply of
wafers, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company
business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if the
Company is unable to obtain scheduled quantities of wafers from any foundry with
acceptable yields, the Company business, financial condition and results of
operations could be negatively impacted.
In addition, certain key components are purchased from single source vendors
for which alternative sources are currently not available. Shortages could occur
in these essential materials due to an interruption of supply or increased
demand in the industry. If the Company were unable to procure certain of such
materials, it would be required to reduce its manufacturing operations which
could have a material adverse effect upon its results of
57 operations. We also rely on third-party subcontractors to assemble and test the
memory components for our products. We have no long-term contracts with these
subcontractors and cannot directly control product delivery schedules. This
could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems that could
increase the manufacturing costs of our products and have adverse effects on our
operating results.
Basis of Presentation
The Company fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to December 31. Fiscal
year 2001 ended on December 30, 2001 and was 52 weeks in length. Fiscal year
2000 ended on December 31, 2000 and was 52 weeks in length. Fiscal year 1999
ended on January 2, 2000 and was 53 weeks in length. For ease of presentation,
the accompanying financial statements have been shown as ending on the last day
of the calendar month.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.
Critical Accounting Policies & Estimates
The Company consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an
on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to
customer programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories,
investments, income taxes, warranty obligations, restructuring, and
contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Revenue recognition. The company recognizes net revenues when the earnings
process is complete, as evidenced by an agreement with the customer, transfer of
title and acceptance if applicable, fixed pricing and probable collectibility.
Because of frequent sales price reductions and rapid technology obsolescence in
the industry, sales made to distributors and retailers under agreements allowing
price protection and/or right of return are deferred until the retailers or
distributors sell the merchandise.
Customer Incentives, Returns and Allowances. The Company records estimated
reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including
promotions and other volume-based incentives, particularly for its retail
customers, which represented 75% of our product revenues in fourth quarter of
2001. If market conditions were to decline, the Company may take actions to
increase customer incentive offerings to its retail customers, possibly
resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is
offered. In addition, the Company records a provision for estimated sales
returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related
revenues are recorded. These estimates are based on historical sales returns,
analysis of credit memo data and other known factors. If the historical data the
Company uses to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future
returns, revenue could be overstated.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts-Methodology. The Company evaluates the
collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In
circumstances where the Company is aware of a specific customer inability to
meet its financial obligations to the Company e.g., bankruptcy filings,
substantial down-grading of credit ratings, the Company records a specific
reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized
receivable to the amount it reasonably believe will be collected. For all other
customers, the Company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of
time the receivables are past due based on its historical experience. If
circumstances change i.e., higher than expected defaults or an unexpected
material adverse change in a major customer ability to meet its financial
obligations to us, the Company estimates of the recoverability of amounts due
it could be reduced by a material amount.
58   Warranty Costs. The Company provides for the estimated cost of product
warranties at the time revenue is recognized. While the Company engages in
product quality programs and processes, its warranty obligation is affected by
product failure rates and repair or replacement costs incurred in correcting a
product failure. Should actual product failure rates, repair or replacement
costs differ from the Company estimates, increases to its warranty liability
would be required.
Valuation of Financial Instruments. The Company short-term investments
include investments in marketable equity and debt securities. The Company also
has equity investments in semiconductor wafer manufacturing companies, UMC of
$1949 million and Tower of $166 million, as of December 31, 2001. In
determining if and when a decline in market value below cost of these
investments is other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates the market
conditions, offering prices, trends of earnings, price multiples, and other key
measures for our investments in marketable equity securities and debt
instruments. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary,
the Company recognizes an impairment loss in the current period operating
results to the extent of the decline. Due to the slowdown in the semiconductor
industry and economic recession in 2001, the market value of the Company UMC
and Tower investments declined significantly. These declines were deemed to be
other-than-temporary and losses totaling $3023 million were recognized. If the
slowdown in the semiconductor industry continues in 2002, the Company may
recognize additional losses on these investments.
Inventories - Slow Moving and Obsolescence. The Company writes down its
inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the
difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value
based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions, including
assumptions about changes in average selling prices. If actual market conditions
are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory
write-downs may be required.
Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Deferred Tax Assets. As of December 31, 2001, the Company has a net deferred
tax asset of approximately $36 million that has been fully offset by a valuation
allowance. Due to its current losses, the Company has not used projections of
future taxable income in determining the amount of the valuation allowance
required.
Foreign Currency Transactions
Foreign operations are measured using the U.S. dollar as the functional
currency. Accordingly, monetary accounts principally cash, accounts receivable
and liabilities are remeasured using the foreign exchange rate at the balance
sheet date. Operations accounts and nonmonetary balance sheet accounts are
remeasured at the rate in effect at the date of transaction. The effects of
foreign currency remeasurement are reported in current operations.
Reclassification
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform
to the current year presentation.
Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments
Cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid financial instruments
with insignificant interest rate risk that are readily convertible to cash and
have maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. Cash
equivalents and short-term investments consist of money market funds, taxable
commercial paper, U.S. government agency obligations, corporate / municipal
notes and bonds with high-credit quality, money market preferred stock and
auction rate preferred stock. Short-term investments also include the
unrestricted portion of the Company investment in foundries for which trading
restrictions expire within one year. The fair market value, based on quoted
59 market prices, of cash equivalents and short-term investments is substantially
equal to their carrying value at December 31, 2001 and 2000.
Under FAS 115, management classifies investments as available-for-sale at the
time of purchase and periodically reevaluates such designation. Debt securities
classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value. Unrecognized gains
or losses on available-for-sale securities are included in equity until their
disposition. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other
than temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in other income
expense. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification
method.
Under the terms of the FlashVision lease agreements, the Company as guarantor
is required to pledge cash and equity securities up to the full value of the
outstanding guaranteed lease commitments. As of December 31, 2001, the Company
had guaranteed $1295 million of FlashVision lease commitments and pledged $647
million of cash and cash equivalents and $647 million of its UMC equity
securities. This pledged cash and cash equivalents and marketable equity
securities are included in Restricted cash and cash equivalents and
Restricted investment in UMC on the Company balance sheet.
The Company investments as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 are as follows in

The unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2001 was
$464 million. At December 31, 2000, the unrealized loss on available-for-sale
securities was $504 million. The unrealized gain includes $958 million of
unrealized gain on the Company investment in UMC in the fourth quarter of 2001
see Investment in Foundry below. Fair value of available-for-sale securities
is based upon quoted market prices. Gross realized gains and losses on sales of
available-for-sale securities during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000
were immaterial.

Long-Term Investments
The Company holds minority equity investments in companies having operations
or technology in areas within SanDisk strategic focus. Certain of the
investments carry restrictions on immediate disposition. Investments in public
companies with restrictions of less than one year are classified as
available-for-sale and are adjusted to their fair market value with unrealized
gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income. Investments in non-public companies are reviewed on a quarterly basis to
determine if their value has been impaired and adjustments are recorded as
necessary. Upon disposition of these investments, the specific identification
method is used to determine the cost basis in computing realized gains or
losses. Declines in value that are judged to be other than temporary are
reported in other income and expense.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable include amounts owed by geographically dispersed
distributors, retailers, and OEM customers. No collateral is required.
Provisions are provided for sales returns, product exchanges and bad debts.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed on a
currently adjusted standard basis which approximates actual costs on a
first-in, first-out basis. Market value is based upon an estimated average
selling price reduced by normal gross margins. Inventories are as follows in
thousands                    61                     December 31,

Finished goods            30,793     9,587
$ 55,968   $ 96,600
In 2001, the Company recorded write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories
and lower of cost or market price adjustments of approximately $85 million. The
Company may be forced to take additional write-downs for excess or obsolete
inventory in future quarters if the current deterioration in market demand for
its products continues and its inventory levels continue to exceed customer
orders. In addition, the Company may record additional lower of cost or market
price adjustments to its inventories if continued pricing pressure results in a
net realizable value that is lower than its manufacturing cost. Although the
Company continuously tries to reduce its inventory in line with the current
level of business, the Company is obligated to honor existing purchase orders,
which have been placed with its suppliers. In the case of its FlashVision joint
venture, the Company is obligated to purchase 50% of the production output,
which makes it more difficult for the Company to reduce its inventory.
Property and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense related to
plant and equipment totaled $205 million, $159 million, and $71 million, in
fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. Depreciation and amortization is
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter, generally two to seven
years.
Property and equipment consist of the following in thousands                             December 31,

Investment in Foundries
The Company has made equity investments in semiconductor wafer
manufacturing companies to obtain access to advanced wafer manufacturing
capacity. The current portion of Investment in Foundries includes the
unrestricted available-for-sale portion of the Company investments in UMC and
Tower. The non-current portion of Investment in Foundries includes the portion
of the Company investments in UMC and Tower that will not be
available-for-sale within one year due to trading restrictions. As of December
31, 2001, the Company total investment in UMC was valued at $1949 million and
its total investment in Tower was valued at $166 million. The Company accounts
for these investments on a cost basis. See Note 8.                    62 Investment in Joint Venture
On June 30, 2000, the Company closed a transaction with Toshiba providing
for the joint development and manufacture of 512 megabit and 1 gigabit flash
memory chips and Secure Digital Card controllers. As part of this transaction,
SanDisk and Toshiba formed FlashVision, a joint venture to equip and operate a
silicon wafer manufacturing line at Dominion Semiconductor in Virginia. As of
December 31, 2001, the Company invested the final $150 million of its $150
million commitment in FlashVision for 499% ownership and guaranteed FlashVision
lease obligations of $1295 million. The Company accounts for its investment in
FlashVision using the equity method. See Note 8.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements SAB 101, which requires
that revenue from product sales and patent license fees be recognized when
persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery of the product has
occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable.
Product revenue, less a provision for estimated sales returns, is recognized
when title passes which is generally at the time of shipment. However, revenue
on shipments to distributors and retailers, subject to certain rights of return
and price protection, is deferred until the merchandise is sold by the
distributors or retailers, or the rights expire.
The Company earns patent license and royalty revenue under patent
cross-license agreements with several companies including Hitachi Ltd., Intel
Corporation, Lexar Media, Inc., Samsung Electronics Company Ltd., Sharp
Electronics Corporation, Silicon Storage Technology, Inc., SmartDisk
Corporation, Sony Corporation, TDK and Toshiba Corporation. The Company
current license agreements provide for the payment of license fees, royalties,
or a combination thereof, to the Company. The timing and amount of these
payments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter, depending on the terms
of each agreement and, in some cases, the timing of sales of products by the
other parties.
Patent license and royalty revenue is recognized when earned. In 2001, 2000
and 1999, the Company received payments under these cross-license agreements,
portions of which were recognized as revenue and portions of which are deferred
revenue. The Company receives royalty revenue reports from certain of its
licensees and records all revenues one quarter in arrears. Recognition of
deferred revenue is expected to occur in future periods over the life of the
agreements, as the Company meets certain obligations as provided in the various
agreements.
Advertising Expense
The cost of advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising costs were $88
million, $82 million, and $36 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.
Net Income Loss Per Share

the dilutive effects of stock options, warrants, and convertible securities.
Options and warrants to purchase 4,892,912; 907,380 and 190,807 shares of common
stock were outstanding during 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, but have been
omitted from the diluted earnings per share calculation because the options'
exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares
and, therefore the effect would be antidilutive. Incremental common shares
attributable to the assumed conversion of the Company convertible subordinated
debentures were not included in the per share computation as the effect would be
antidilutive for fiscal year 2001.
Stock Based Compensation
The Company accounts for employee stock based compensation under APB Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations.
Pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share disclosures are
required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for
Stock Based Compensation, and are included in Note 4.
Issued Accounting Standards
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 141, Business
Combinations and No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141
supersedes Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion 16 Business
Combinations and SFAS No. 38 Accounting for Pre-acquisition Contingencies,
and eliminates the pooling-of-interests method of accounting for business
combinations except for qualifying business combinations that were initiated
prior to July 1, 2001. SFAS No. 141 also includes new criteria to recognize
intangible assets separately from goodwill. The requirements of SFAS 141 are
effective for any business combination accounted for by the purchase method that
is completed after June 30, 2001 i.e., the acquisition date is July 1, 2001 or
after. The Company did not engage in any merger or acquisition activity during
the year and therefore, application of SFAS 141 is not expected to have a
material impact on results of operation and financial position in 2002.
64  SFAS No. 142, supersedes APB Opinion No. 17, Intangible Assets, and states
that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer
amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if
impairment indicators arise. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to
have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives.
The discontinuing of amortization provisions under SFAS No. 142 of goodwill and
indefinite lived intangible assets apply to assets acquired after June 30, 2001.
In addition, the impairment provisions of SFAS 142 apply to assets acquired
prior to July 1, 2001 upon adoption of SFAS 142. Application of the
non-amortization provisions and changes in estimated useful lives of intangibles
of FAS 142 for goodwill is not expected to have a material impact on results of
operation and financial position in 2002.
In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS No. 144, which supersedes SFAS No.
121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be disposed of. The primary objective of SFAS No. 144 is to develop
one accounting model based on the framework established in SFAS No. 121 for
long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, and to address significant
implementation issues. The provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2001, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, with early application encouraged. Sandisk is evaluating the impact of
SFAS No. 144 on its financial position and results of operations.
Note 2: Financial Instruments
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company concentration of credit risk consists principally of cash, cash
equivalents, short-term investments and trade receivables. The Company
investment policy restricts investments to high-credit quality investments and
limits the amounts invested with any one issuer. The Company sells to original
equipment manufacturers, retailers and distributors in the United States, Japan,
Europe and the Far East, performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers'
financial condition, and generally requires no collateral. Reserves are
maintained for potential credit losses.
Off Balance Sheet Risk
Under our FlashVision joint venture agreement with Toshiba see Note 8, we
are obligated to guarantee one-half of all FlashVision lease amounts up to a
maximum guarantee of $1750 million. As of December 31, 2001, we had guarantee
obligations in the amount of $1295 million, with ABN AMRO Bank, N.V. as agent
for a syndicate of financial institutions, on the equipment lease lines to equip
FlashVision manufacturing clean room with advanced wafer processing equipment.
Under the terms of the FlashVision lease agreements, we as guarantor are subject
to certain financial covenants. We obtained a compliance waiver for the third
quarter of 2001 and negotiated an amendment to the lease agreement which
includes a modification of the covenant requirements and requires us to pledge
cash and equity securities up to the full value of the outstanding guaranteed
lease commitments. As of December 31, 2001, we had pledged cash of $647 million
and UMC equity securities of $647 million and was in compliance with the
covenant requirements.
Note 3: Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
The Company is obligated to guarantee one-half of all FlashVision lease
amounts up to a maximum guarantee of $1750 million. As of December 31, 2001,
the Company had guarantee obligations in the amount of $1295 million, with ABN
AMRO Bank, N.V. as agent for a syndicate of financial institutions, on the
equipment lease lines to equip FlashVision manufacturing clean room with
advanced wafer processing equipment. In March 2002, FlashVision notified ABN
AMRO that it was exercising its right of early termination under the lease
facility and will repay all amounts outstanding thereunder in April 2002. The
Company and Toshiba are currently seeking other sources of financing to replace
the ABN AMRO lease facility. However, under the terms of the FlashVision lease
agreements, the Company as guarantor remains at this time subject to certain
financial covenants, including calculations of leverage, tangible net worth,
fixed charge coverage and current assets to current liabilities. The Company
obtained a
65 compliance waiver for the third quarter of 2001 and negotiated an amendment to
the lease agreement which includes a modification of the covenant requirements
and requires it to pledge cash and equity securities up to the full value of the
outstanding guaranteed lease commitments. As of December 31, 2001, the Company
had pledged cash of $647 million and UMC equity securities of $647 million as
collateral against the lease balance of $1295 million. While these assets are
pledged, they are not available to the Company to be used to fund operations.
In December 2001, the Company signed a binding memorandum of understanding,
or MOU, with Toshiba under which the Company and Toshiba agreed to restructure
our FlashVision business by consolidating our FlashVision advanced NAND wafer
fabrication manufacturing operations at Toshiba memory fabrication facility at
Yokkaichi, Japan. The Company and Toshiba contemplate that the FlashVision
operation at Yokkaichi will continue essentially the same 50-50 joint venture
and on essentially the same terms as it had at Dominion in Virginia. Under the
joint venture agreement, the Company is contractually obligated, and expects to
continue to be obligated after the restructuring of its FlashVision joint
venture, to purchase half of FlashVision NAND wafer production output.
Apart from its commitment to purchase 50% of the FlashVision wafer output
from Yokkaichi after the restructuring, the Company will also purchase NAND
wafers from Toshiba current Yokkaichi fabrication facility on a foundry
relationship basis. This foundry relationship will be conducted under a firm
purchase order commitment over rolling three-month periods. NAND wafers are
ordered under purchase orders at market prices and cannot be cancelled. At
December 31, 2001, approximately $325 million of non-cancelable purchase orders
for flash memory wafers from FlashVison were outstanding. If the Company places
purchase orders with Toshiba and its business condition deteriorates, it may end
up with excess inventories of NAND wafers, which could harm its business and
financial condition. The Company will incur start-up costs and pay its share of
ongoing operating activities even if we do not utilize our full share of the new
Yokkaichi output.
As part of their joint venture agreement, the Company and Toshiba also agreed
to share certain research and development expenses related to the development of
advanced NAND flash memory technologies. As of December 31, 2001, the Company
had accrued current liabilities related to these expenses of $153 million and
long-term liabilities of $49 million. These obligation will be paid in
installments throughout 2002 and 2003. In addition, beginning in 2002, the
Company will make quarterly payments to Toshiba for the Company portion of the
research and development expenses associated with the continued development of
advanced NAND flash memory technologies. The amount of these payments will be
calculated as a percentage of the Company revenues from NAND flash memory
products.
On July 4, 2000, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement to
make a $750 million investment in Tower, in Israel, representing approximately
10% ownership of Tower. The investment is subject to the completion of certain
milestones. During 2001, Tower satisfied the closing conditions of the share
purchase agreement and completed the first two milestones. Under the terms of
the agreement, the Company invested $425 million. Under the original agreement,
additional contributions by the Company will take the form of mandatory warrant
exercises for ordinary shares at an exercise price of $3000 per share if other
milestones are met by Tower. The warrants will expire five years from the date
of grant, and in the event the key milestones are not achieved, the exercise of
these warrants will not be mandatory. However, in March of 2002, we modified our
share purchase agreement with Tower by agreeing to advance the payments for the
third and fourth milestones to April 5, 2002 and October 1, 2002, respectively.
We will make these payments whether or not Tower actually achieves its
previously agreed upon milestone obligations. In exchange for this and as part
of the modification to the share purchase agreement, Tower has agreed that of
the aggregate payment of $220 million represented by the third and fourth
milestone payments, i 60% of this amount, or $132 million, will be applied to
the issuance of additional ordinary Tower shares based on the average closing
price of Tower shares on the NASDAQ in the thirty consecutive trading days
preceding each payment date but not to exceed $1250 per share and ii 40% of
this amount, or $88 million, will be credited to our pre-paid wafer account, to
be applied against orders placed with Tower new fabrication facility, when
completed.
The Company leases its headquarters and sales offices under operating leases
that expire at various dates through 2006. Future minimum lease payments under
operating leases at December 31, 2000 are as follows in thousands                    66 Year Ending December 31  2002      $ 2,623
2003        2,408
2004        2,430
2005        2,264
2006        1,029
Total      $ 10,754
Rental expense under all operating leases was $36 million, $25 million, and
$21 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively.
The Company had foreign exchange contract lines in the amount of $651
million at December 31, 2001. Under these lines, the Company may enter into
forward exchange contracts that require the Company to sell or purchase foreign
currencies. One forward exchange contract in the notional amount of $98 million
was outstanding at December 31, 2001.
Contingencies
The Company relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyright and
trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to
protect its intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that there
will not be any disputes regarding the Company intellectual property rights.
Specifically, there can be no assurance that any patents held by the Company
will not be invalidated, that patents will be issued for any of the Company
pending applications or that any claims allowed from existing or pending patents
will be of sufficient scope or strength or be issued in the primary countries
where the Company products can be sold to provide meaningful protection or any
commercial advantage to the Company. Additionally, competitors of the Company
may be able to design around the Company patents.
To preserve its intellectual property rights, the Company believes it may be
necessary to initiate litigation with one or more third parties, including but
not limited to those the Company has notified of possible patent infringement.
In addition, one or more of these parties may bring suit against the Company.
Any litigation, whether as a plaintiff or as a defendant, would likely result in
significant expense to the Company and divert the efforts of the Company
technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is ultimately
determined in favor of the Company.
On or about August 3, 2001, the Lemelson Medical, Education & Research
Foundation, or Lemelson Foundation, filed a complaint for patent infringement
against the Company and four other defendants. The suit, captioned Lemelson
Medical, Education, & Research Foundation, Limited Partnership vs. Broadcom
Corporation, et al., Civil Case No. CIV01 1440PHX HRH, was filed in the United
States District Court, District of Arizona. On November 13, 2001, the Lemelson
Foundation filed an Amended Complaint, which made the same substantive
allegations against the Company but named more than twenty-five additional
defendants. The Amended Complaint alleges that the Company, and the other
defendants, have infringed certain patents held by the Lemelson Foundation
pertaining to bar code scanning technology. By its complaint, the Lemelson
Foundation requests that the Company be enjoined from its allegedly infringing
activities and seeks unspecified damages. On February 4, 2002, the Company filed
an answer to the amended complaint, wherein the Company alleged that it does not
infringe the asserted patents, and further contend that the patents are not
valid or enforceable.
On October 15, 2001, the Company filed a complaint for patent infringement
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California
against Micron Technology, Inc., or Micron. In the suit, captioned SanDisk Corp.
v. Micron Technology, Inc., Civil No. CV 01-3855 CW, the complaint seeks damages
and an injunction against Micron for making, selling, importing or using flash
memory cards that infringe the Company U.S. Patent No. 6,149,316. On February
15, 2002, Micron answered the complaint, denied liability, and counterclaimed
seeking a declaration that the patent in suit is not infringed, is invalid, and
is unenforceable.
67   On October 31, 2001, the Company filed a complaint for patent infringement
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California
against Memorex Products, Inc., Pretec Electronics Corporation, Ritek
Corporation and Power Quotient International Co., Ltd. In the suit, captioned
SanDisk Corp. v. Memorex Products, Inc., et. al., Civil No. CV 01-4063 VRW, the
complaint seeks damages and injunctions against these companies from making,
selling, importing or using flash memory cards that infringe the Company U.S.
patent No. 5,602,987, or the `987 Patent. Defendants Memorex, Pretec and Ritek
have filed answers denying the allegations. The Company has filed a motion for a
preliminary injunction in the suit to enjoin Memorex, Pretec and Ritek from
making, selling, importing or using flash memory cards that infringe our `987
Patent prior to the trial on the merits. This preliminary injunction motion is
scheduled for hearing on April 11, 2002.
On November 30, 2001, the Company filed a complaint for patent infringement
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California
against Power Quotient International - USA Inc, or PQI-USA. In the suit,
captioned SanDisk Corp. v. Power Quotient International - USA Inc., Civil No. C
01-21111, the complaint seeks damages and an injunction against PQI-USA from
making, selling, importing or using flash memory cards that infringe our U.S.
patent No. 5,602,987. The PQI-USA complaint and litigation are related to the
October 31, 2001 litigation referred to above. The products at issue in the
PQI-USA case are identical to those charged with infringement in the October 31,
2001 litigation. On December 21, 2001, PQI-USA filed an answer to the complaint
denying the allegations, which included a counter claim for a declaratory
judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of our `987 Patent. The Company has
motioned for a preliminary injunction in the suit to enjoin PQI-USA from making,
selling, importing or using flash memory cards that infringe our `987 Patent
prior to the trial on the merits. This preliminary injunction motion is
scheduled for hearing on April 8, 2002.
On or about March 5, 2002, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, filed a
patent infringement lawsuit against the Company in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The lawsuit alleges that the Company
infringes four Samsung United States patents, Nos. 5,473,563; 5,514,889;
5,546,341 and 5,642,309, and seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction
against unnamed products of the Company, as well as damages, attorneys' fees and
cost of the lawsuit.
On March 21, 2000, Mitsubishi Denki Co. Ltd. Mitsubishi Electric filed a
complaint in Tokyo District Court against SanDisk K.K., SanDisk wholly owned
subsidiary in Japan. The complaint alleges that SanDisk K.K., based in Yokohama,
Japan, infringes on three Mitsubishi Japanese patents, which are related
primarily to the mechanical construction of memory cards. In the complaint,
Mitsubishi asked the court for a preliminary injunction halting the sale of
SanDisk CompactFlash and flash ATA memory cards in Japan. Mitsubishi dropped two
of the patents from the suit. During the second quarter, we won a favorable
ruling, dismissing the complaint on the third patent and thereby concluding the
Mitsubishi lawsuit.
In Chile, Compaq Corporation is opposing our attempt to register CompactFlash
as a trademark. We do not believe that our failure to obtain registration for
the CompactFlash mark in any country will materially harm our business. SanDisk
successfully obtained the United States trademark registration for the mark
CompactFlash.
In the event of an adverse result in any such litigation, the Company could
be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use and sale of
infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing
technology or obtain licenses to the infringing technology, or discontinue the
use of certain processes.
From time to time the Company agrees to indemnify certain of its suppliers
and customers for alleged patent infringement. The scope of such indemnity
varies but may in some instances include indemnification for damages and
expenses, including attorneys' fees. The Company may from time to time be
engaged in litigation as a result of such indemnification obligations. Third
party claims for patent infringement are excluded from coverage under the
Company insurance policies. There can be no assurance that any future
obligation to indemnify the Company customers or suppliers, will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company business, financial condition and
results of operations.
Litigation frequently involves substantial expenditures and can require
significant management attention, even if the Company ultimately prevails. In
addition, the results of any litigation matters are inherently uncertain.
68 Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing matters, or any
future litigation, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company
business, financial condition and results of operations.
Note 4: Convertible Subordinated Notes Payable
On December 24, 2001, the Company completed a private placement of $1250
million of 4 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006, or Notes, and on
January 10, 2002 the initial purchasers completed the exercise of their option
to purchase an additional $250 million of Notes, for which the Company received
net proceeds of approximately $1459 million. Based on the aggregate principal
amount at maturity of $1500 million, the Notes provide for semi-annual interest
payments of $34 million each on May 15 and November 15. The Notes are
convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to the close of
business on the maturity date, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, at a
conversion rate of 542535 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes,
subject to adjustment in certain events. At anytime on or after November 17,
2004, the Company may redeem the notes in whole or in part at a specified
percentage of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The debt issuance
costs are being amortized over the term of the Notes using the interest method.
Note 5: Stockholders' Equity
Stock Benefit Plan
The 1989 Stock Benefit Plan, in effect through August 1995, comprised two
separate programs, the Stock Issuance Program and the Option Grant Program. The
Stock Issuance Program allowed eligible individuals to immediately purchase the
Company common stock at a fair value as determined by the Board of Directors.
Under the Option Grant Program, eligible individuals were granted options to
purchase shares of the Company common stock at a fair value, as determined by
the Board of Directors, of such shares on the date of grant. The options
generally vest over a four-year period, expiring no later than ten years from
the date of grant. Unexercised options are canceled upon the termination of
employment or services. Options that are canceled under this plan will be
available for future grants under the 1995 Stock Option Plan. There were no
shares available for option grants under the 1989 Stock Benefit Plan at December
31, 2001.
1995 Stock Benefit Plan
The 1995 Stock Option Plan provides for the issuance of incentive stock
options and nonqualified stock options. Under this plan, the vesting and
exercise provisions of option grants are determined by the Board of Directors.
The options generally vest over a four-year period, expiring no later than ten
years from the date of grant.
In May 1999, the stockholders increased the shares available for future
issuance under the 1995 Stock Benefit Plan by 7,000,000 shares and approved an
automatic share increase feature pursuant to which the number of shares
available for issuance under the plan will automatically increase on the first
trading day in January each calendar year, beginning with calendar year 2002 and
continuing over the remaining term of the plan, by an amount equal to
approximately 4% of the total number of shares outstanding on the last trading
day in December in the immediately preceding calendar year, but in no event will
any such annual increase exceed 4,000,000 shares.
1995 Non-employee Directors Stock Option Plan
In August 1995, the Company adopted the 1995 Non-employee Directors Stock
Option Plan the Directors' Plan. Under this plan, automatic option grants are
made at periodic intervals to eligible non-employee members of the Board of
Directors. Initial option grants vest over a four-year period. Subsequent annual
grants vest one year after date of grant. All options granted under the
Non-employee Directors Stock Option Plan expire ten years after the date of
grant. In May 1999, the stockholders increased the shares available for future
issuance under the 1995 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan by 400,000 and
approved an automatic share increase feature pursuant to which the number of
shares available for issuance under the plan will automatically increase on the
first trading day in January each calendar year, beginning with calendar year
2002 and continuing over the remaining term of the plan, by an amount equal to
02% of the total number of shares outstanding on the last trading day in
December in
69 the immediately preceding calendar year, but in no event will any such annual
increase exceed 200,000 shares. At December 31, 2001, the Company had reserved
800,000 shares for issuance under the Directors' Plan and a total of 528,000
options had been granted at exercise prices ranging from $500 to $70063 per
share.

In August 1995, the Company adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan the
Purchase Plan. In May 1999, the stockholders increased the shares available for
future issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan by 600,000 and approved
an automatic share increase feature pursuant to which the number of shares
available for issuance under the plan will automatically increase on the first
trading day in January each calendar year, beginning with calendar year 2002 and
continuing over the remaining term of the plan, by an amount equal to
forty-three hundredths of one percent 043% of the total number of shares
outstanding on the last trading day in December in the immediately preceding
calendar year, but in no event will any such annual increase exceed 400,000
shares. Under the Purchase Plan, qualified employees are entitled to purchase
shares through payroll deductions at 85% of the fair market value at the
beginning or end of the offering period, whichever is lower. As of December 31,
2001, the Company had reserved 2,366,666 shares of common stock for issuance
under the Purchase Plan and a total of 1,203,337 shares had been issued.
70 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation
The Company has elected to follow APB 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for its employee stock options because, as discussed below, the
alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS 123 Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, requires use of option valuation models that were not
developed for use in valuing employee stock options. Under APB 25, because the
exercise price of the Company stock options equals the market price of the
underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required
by SFAS 123, which also requires that the information be determined as if the
Company has accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method
of this Statement. The fair value for the options granted was estimated at the
date of grant using a Black-Scholes single option pricing model with the
following weighted average assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 468%, 616%
and 552% for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively; a dividend yield of 00%, a
volatility factor of the expected market price of the Company common stock of
0955, 0951 and 0888 for 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively; and a
weighted-average expected life of the option of approximately 5 years. The
weighted average fair value of those options granted were $1447, $3982 and
$2238 for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company
employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those
of traded options, and because changes in the subjective assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in management opinion, the existing
models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of
its employee stock options.
Under the 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, participating employees can
choose to have up to 10% of their annual base earnings withheld to purchase the
Company common stock. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of
the subscription date fair market value and the purchase date fair market value.
Approximately 53% of eligible employees participated in the plan in 2001 and 78%
and 79% in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Under the Plan, the Company sold
169,044, 69,423 and 269,092 shares to employees in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Pursuant to APB 25 and related interpretations, the Company does
not recognize compensation cost related to employee purchase rights under the
Plan. To comply with the pro forma reporting requirements of SFAS 123,
compensation cost is estimated for the fair value of the employees' purchase
rights using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions for those
rights granted in 2001, 2000 and 1999: dividend yield of 00%; and expected life
of 6 months; expected volatility factor of 80 and 94 in 2001, 156 and 118 in
2000 and 98 and 116 in 1999; and a risk free interest rate ranging from 438%
to 643%. The weighted average fair value of those purchase rights granted in
February 1999, August 1999, February 2000, August 2000, February 2001 and August
2001 were $601, $1772, $3869, $2924, $1167 and $1015, respectively.
Had compensation cost for the Company stock-based compensation plans been
determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those

Shareholder Rights Plan
71  On April 21, 1997, the Company adopted a shareholder rights plan the Rights
Agreement. Under the Rights Agreement, rights were distributed as a dividend at
the rate of one right for each share of common stock of the Company held by
stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 28, 1997. The rights
will expire on April 28, 2007 unless redeemed or exchanged. Under the Rights
Agreement, each right will initially entitle the registered holder to buy one
one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for
$50000. The rights will become exercisable only if a person or group acquires
beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of the Company common stock or
commences a tender offer or exchange offer upon consummation of which such
person or group would beneficially own 15 percent or more of the Company
common stock.
Note 6: Retirement Plan
Effective January 1, 1992, the Company adopted a tax-deferred savings plan,
the SanDisk 401k Plan, for the benefit of qualified employees. The plan is
designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds at retirement.
Qualified employees may elect to make contributions to the plan on a monthly
basis. The Company may make annual contributions to the plan at the discretion
of the Board of Directors. The Company contributed $11 million and $105,000 for
the plan years ended December 31, 2001 and 1999, respectively. No contributions
were made by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2000.

in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Such benefits are credited to capital in excess
of par when realized.
The Company provision for benefit from income taxes differs from the
amount computed by applying the federal statutory rates to income loss before

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amount used for income tax purposes. Significant components of
the Company deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 are as
follows in thousands                              December 31,

The Company provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax
assets, as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The valuation allowance increased by $361million in 2001.
Approximately $48 million of the valuation allowance shown above relates to tax
benefits from stock option deductions that will be credited to equity when
realized.
The Company has a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately
$11 million that will expire in 2021 and state net operating losses of
approximately $36 million that will begin to expire at various dates beginning
in 2006 through 2021. The Company has various federal and state tax credits that
will begin to expire at various dates beginning in 2004 through 2021. Federal
alternative minimum tax credits and certain stated credits do not expire.
Utilization of the Company net operating loss and tax credit carry
forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership
change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state
provisions.
73 Note 8: Joint Venture, Strategic Manufacturing Relationships and Investments
On June 30, 2000, the Company closed a transaction with Toshiba providing for
the joint development and manufacture of 512 megabit and 1 gigabit flash memory
chips and Secure Digital Card controllers. As part of this transaction, SanDisk
and Toshiba formed FlashVision, a joint venture to equip and operate a silicon
wafer manufacturing line at Dominion Semiconductor in Virginia. In January 2001,
the Company invested the final $150 million of its $1500 million cash
commitment in FlashVision. The Company agreed to guarantee one-half of all
FlashVision lease amounts up to a maximum guarantee of $1750 million. As of
December 31, 2001, the Company had guarantee obligations in the amount of $1295
million, with ABN AMRO Bank, N.V. as agent for a syndicate of financial
institutions, on the equipment lease lines to equip FlashVision manufacturing
clean room with advanced wafer processing equipment. Although FlashVision
recently terminated the ABN AMRO lease facility, as further discussed below,
under the terms of the FlashVision lease agreements, the Company as guarantor
remains at this time subject to certain financial covenants. The Company
obtained a compliance waiver for the third quarter of 2001 and negotiated an
amendment to the lease agreement. which includes a modification of the covenant
requirements and requires the Company to pledge cash and equity securities up to
the full value of the outstanding guaranteed lease commitments. As of December
31, 2001, we had pledged cash of $647 million and UMC equity securities of
$647 million. While these assets are pledged, they are not available to the
Company to be used to fund operations.
In December 2001, the Company signed a binding memorandum of understanding,
or MOU, with Toshiba under which the Company and Toshiba agreed to restructure
their FlashVision business by consolidating FlashVision advanced NAND wafer
fabrication manufacturing operations at Toshiba memory fabrication facility at
Yokkaichi, Japan. The Yokkaichi fabrication facility, or Yokkaichi, is Toshiba
most advanced memory fabrication facility and has approximately twice the wafer
fabrication capacity of Dominion. Through this consolidation, the Company
expects Yokkaichi to provide more cost-competitive NAND flash wafers than is
possible at Dominion. Under the terms of the MOU, Toshiba will transfer the
FlashVision owned and leased NAND production tool-set from Dominion to Yokkaichi
and has agreed to undertake full responsibility for the transition, which is
expected to be completed in 2002. Once the consolidation is completed,
Yokkaichi total NAND wafer output will match the combined prior NAND capacity
of Yokkaichi and Dominion. The Company and Toshiba contemplate that the
FlashVision operation at Yokkaichi will continue essentially the same 50-50
joint venture and on essentially the same terms as it has had at Dominion in
Virginia. In March 2002, FlashVision notified ABN AMRO that it was exercising
its right of early termination under the lease facility and will repay all
amounts outstanding thereunder in April 2002. The Company and Toshiba are
currently seeking other sources of financing to replace the ABN AMRO lease
facility.
The Company invested $512 million in United Silicon, Inc., USIC a
semiconductor manufacturing subsidiary of United Microelectronics Corporation in
Taiwan UMC. In January 2000, the USIC foundry was merged into the UMC parent
company. In exchange for its USIC shares, the Company received 111 million UMC
shares. These shares were valued at approximately $396 million at the time of
the merger, resulting in a pretax gain of $3442 million $2039 million
after-tax in the first quarter of 2000. All of the UMC shares the Company
received as a result of the merger were subject to trading restrictions imposed
by UMC and the Taiwan Stock Exchange. As of December 31, 2001, the trading
restrictions had expired on 667 million shares. The remaining 444 million
shares will become available for sale over a two-year period beginning in
January 2002. In July of 2001, the Company received a stock dividends from UMC
of 200 million and 222 million shares in 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Due to the decline in the UMC stock price from the weakness in the
semiconductor industry, the value of the Company investment in UMC had
declined to $1949 at December 31, 2001. It was determined that the decline in
the market value of the investment was other than temporary, as defined by
generally accepted accounting principles and a loss of $2758 million, or $1669
million net of taxes was recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards Number 115. The loss was included in loss on investment in
foundry. If the fair value of the UMC investment declines further, it may be
necessary to record additional losses. In addition, in future periods, there may
be a gain or loss due to fluctuations in the market value of UMC stock or if UMC
shares are sold.
74   On July 4, 2000, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement to
make a $750 million investment in Tower Semiconductor, Tower, in Israel,
representing approximately 10% ownership of Tower. The investment is subject to
the completion of certain milestones relative to the construction of a new wafer
fabrication facility by Tower. During 2001, Tower satisfied the closing
conditions of the share purchase agreement and completed the first two
milestones. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company has invested $425
million to purchase 1,599,931 ordinary shares and obtain wafer credits of $214
million. In September 2001, the Company agreed to convert 75% of its wafer
credits to equity at a price of $1275 per share and received an additional
1,284,007 ordinary shares. The Company expects first wafer production to
commence at the new fabrication facility in late 2002. Due to the continued
weakness in the semiconductor industry, the value of the Company Tower
investment and remaining wafer credits had declined to $166 million on December
31, 2001. It was determined that this decline was other than temporary, as
defined by generally accepted accounting principles and a loss of $206 million
was recorded in the second half of 2001. In addition, the Company recognized a
loss of $55 million on the exchange of 75% of its Tower wafer credits for 1,
284,007 ordinary shares at $1275 per share. These losses totaling $261
million, or $158 million net of tax benefit, were recorded in loss on
investment in foundry in 2001. The Company accounts for its investment in Tower
on a cost basis. In March of 2002, the Company modified its share purchase
agreement with Tower by agreeing to advance the payments of the third and fourth
milestone payment dates to April 5, 2002 and October 1, 2002, respectively, and
to make these payments whether or not Tower actually achieves its previously
agreed upon milestone obligations. In exchange for this and as part of the
modification to the share purchase agreement, Tower has agreed that of the
aggregate payment of $220 million represented by the third and fourth milestone
payments, i 60% of this amount, or $132 million, will be applied to the
issuance of additional ordinary Tower shares based on the average closing price
of Tower shares on the NASDAQ in the thirty consecutive trading days preceding
each payment date but not to exceed $1250 per share and ii 40% of this
amount, or $88 million, will be credited to the Company pre-paid wafer
account, to be applied against orders placed with Tower new fabrication
facility, when completed.
In September 2001, the Company signed an agreement with Sony involving
their Memory Stick card format. Under the agreement, Sony will supply the
Company a portion of their Memory Stick output for the Company to resell under
the SanDisk brand name. Sony has also agreed to purchase a portion of its NAND
memory chip requirements from the Company provided that it meets market
competitive pricing for these components. In addition, the two companies agreed
to co-develop and co-own the specifications for the next generation Memory
Stick. Each company will have all rights to manufacture and sell this new
generation Memory Stick.
On August 9, 2000, SanDisk entered into a joint venture, Digital Portal,
Inc. DPI, with Photo-Me International PMI for the manufacture,
installation, marketing, and maintenance of self-service, digital photo printing
labs, or kiosks, bearing the SanDisk brand name in locations in the U.S. and
Canada. Under the agreement, the Company and PMI will each make an initial
investment of $40 million for 50% ownership and secure lease financing for the
purchase of the kiosks. During 2001, the Company invested $20 million in DPI.
Recently, DPI has changed its business plan from 100% leasing the kiosks to
customers and sharing in the photo printing revenues generated, to a mix of
leasing and selling the kiosks outright. While this plan may reduce the
long-term cumulative income from each kiosk, it is expected to substantially
reduce DPI requirements for lease financing. Therefore, the Company expects
based on the current business plan that the total value of its lease guarantees
will be below $50 million in 2002. PMI will manufacture the kiosks for the
joint venture and will install and maintain the kiosks under contract with the
joint venture. The Company accounts for this investment under the equity method,
and recorded a loss of $14 million as its share of the equity in loss of joint
venture in 2001.
On November 2, 2000, the Company made a strategic investment of $72
million in Divio, Inc. Divio is a privately-held manufacturer of digital imaging
compression technology and products for future digital camcorders that will be
capable of using our flash memory cards to store home video movies, replacing
the magnetic tape currently used in these systems. Under the agreement, the
Company owns approximately 10% of Divio and is entitled to one board seat. The
Company accounts for the investment under the cost method.
Note 9: Derivatives
On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. The standard requires that all derivatives be recorded on the
balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and
effectiveness of hedging relationships. The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS
133 as of January 1, 2001 was not material to the Company consolidated
financial statements.
The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in
forecasted sales, cost of sales, and assets and liabilities denominated in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company is also exposed to interest
rate risk inherent in its debt and investment portfolios. The Company risk
management strategy provides for the use of derivative financial instruments,
including foreign exchange forward contracts, to hedge certain foreign currency
exposures. The Company intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the
underlying exposures, with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging
these exposures. The Company does not enter into any speculative
75 positions with regard to derivative instruments. The Company enters into foreign
exchange contracts to hedge against exposure to changes in foreign currency
exchange rates, only when natural offsets cannot be achieved. Such contracts are
designated at inception to the related foreign currency exposures being hedged,
which include sales by subsidiaries, and assets and liabilities that are
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company foreign
currency hedges generally mature within six months.
All derivatives are recorded at fair market value on the balance sheet,
classified in other assets. For derivative instruments that are designated and
qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the
derivative instrument is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a
separate component of stockholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the
period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. For derivative
instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or
loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings in the
current period. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging
instruments, changes in their fair values are recognized in earnings in the
current period.
For foreign currency forward contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured by
comparing the cumulative change in the hedged contract with the cumulative
change in the hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates. To the
extent that the critical terms of the hedged item and the derivative are not
identical, hedge ineffectiveness is reported in earnings immediately. The
Company estimates the fair values on derivatives based on quoted market prices
or pricing models using current market rates.
The Company reports hedge ineffectiveness from foreign currency derivatives
for both options and forward contracts in other income or expense. Hedge
ineffectiveness was not material in fiscal 2001. The effective portion of all
derivatives is reported in the same financial statement line item as the changes
in the hedged item.
The Company had foreign exchange contract lines in the amount of $651 million
at December 31, 2001. Under these lines, the Company may enter into forward
exchange contracts that require the Company to sell or purchase foreign
currencies.
At December 31, 2001, the Company had $236 million in Japanese
Yen-denominated accounts payable and open purchase orders designated as cash
flow hedges or fair value hedges against Japanese Yen-denominated cash holdings
and accounts receivable. At December 31, 2001, the Company had one forward
contract to sell Yen in the amount of $98 million. Foreign currency translation
gains of $291,000 were deferred at December 31, 2001 in connection with this
contract as the contract has been identified as a hedging contract. One forward
exchange contract in the notional amount of $98 million was outstanding at
December 31, 2001. The Company estimates the fair values of derivatives based on
quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. There was no
unrealized loss on derivative instruments as of December 31, 2001.
The impact of movements in currency exchange rates on foreign exchange
contracts substantially mitigates the related impact on the underlying items
hedged. The Company had net transaction gains losses of approximately
$894,000, $428,000, and $1,467,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001,
2000, and 1999, respectively. These amounts are included in other income loss,
net, in the statement of operations.
Note 10: Restructuring Charge and Related Activities
In the third quarter of 2001, the Company adopted a plan to transfer all of
its card assembly and test manufacturing operations from its Sunnyvale location
to offshore subcontractors. As a result, the Company recorded a restructuring
charge of $85 million. The charge included $11 million of severance and
employee related costs for a reduction in workforce of approximately 193
personnel, equipment write-off charges of $64 million and lease commitments of
$10 million on a vacated warehouse facility.
Workforce Reduction: In the third quarter of 2001, the Company adopted a
plan to reduce its workforce by a total of 193 employees through involuntary
employee separations from October 2001 through April 2002. The Company recorded
a charge of $11 million for employee separations in the third quarter of 2001.
As of December 31, 2001, the Company had made severance and benefit payments
related to the planned reduction in force totaling
76 805,000.
Abandonment of Excess Equipment: As a part of its plan to transfer all card
assembly and test manufacturing operations to offshore subcontractors, the
Company abandoned excess equipment and recorded a charge of $64 million in the
third quarter of fiscal 2001.
Abandonment of Excess Leased Facilities: The Company is attempting to
sublease one warehouse building in San Jose, California. Given the current real
estate market condition in the San Jose area, the Company does not expect to be
able to sublease this building before the end of 2003 and as a result, the
Company has recorded a charge of $10 million in the third quarter of 2001.
Remaining Payout: Remaining cash expenditures related to the workforce
reduction will be paid by April 2002. Amounts related to the abandonment of
excess leased facilities will be paid as the lease payments are due in 2002 and
2003.
Savings: The Company believes that the savings resulting from the
restructuring activity will contribute to a reduction in manufacturing and
operating expense levels by approximately $118 million in fiscal 2002.
