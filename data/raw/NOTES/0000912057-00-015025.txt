ITEM 8.  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Metro Information Services, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Metro
Information Services, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31,
1998 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
redeemable common stock and shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1999. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based upon our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Metro Information
Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1999 and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
NATURE OF BUSINESS
Metro Information Services, Inc. together with its wholly-owned
consolidated subsidiaries Metro Information Services of Northern California,
Inc., Metro Information Services of Los Angeles, Inc., Metro Information
Services of Orange County, Inc., Metro Information Services of Pennsylvania,
Inc. and Metro Information Services - ATS, Inc. Metro or the Company is an
information technology IT consulting services company providing IT
consultants on a contract basis to organizations with complex IT operations. On
December 31, 1999, the Company had 45 offices in the United States and Puerto
Rico.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated.
REVENUE RECOGNITION AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company derives substantially all of its revenue from consulting
services and substantially all services provided by the Company are billed on a
time and materials basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due
to the number and diversity of the Company client base.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid debt instruments with
original maturities of three months or less. Cash equivalents at December 31,
1999 and 1998 consisted of overnight money market investments.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts of the Company financial instruments, primarily
accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued compensation and benefits,
approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The
carrying amounts of the Company line of credit facilities approximate fair
value due to their variable interest rates.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on property and
equipment is calculated on the straight-line method over their estimated useful
lives. Depreciation on leasehold improvements is calculated on the straight-line
method over the lesser of the length of the lease term or their estimated useful
lives.
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill and other intangible assets represent the excess of cost over
fair value of net tangible assets acquired through acquisitions and are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, generally
30 years for goodwill and 3-10 years for other intangible assets. Management
periodically assesses whether there has been a permanent impairment in the value
of goodwill, customer base and other intangible assets. Impairment is determined
by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of
the related goodwill, customer base and other intangibles. If such assets are
considered impaired, the impairment is measured as the amount by which the
carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.                   Page 33    INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and, if applicable, operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date.
USE OF ESTIMATES
Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions
relating to the reporting of revenue and expense, assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current
year presentation.
2 RESTRICTED CASH
Metro agreed to act as payment agent for a client on an information
technology project beginning in 1998. As of December 31, 1999, the Company held
no restricted cash for this client. As of December 31, 1998, the Company held
$1,264,524 of restricted cash for this client and this amount was included in
cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable presented in the consolidated
balance sheets as of that date. Client approved invoices were paid out of the
restricted cash held. Metro was not obligated to pay invoices that exceeded the
amount of the restricted cash held.
3 INTERNAL USE SOFTWARE COSTS
On March 4, 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued Statement of Position 98-1 SOP, ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF COMPUTER
SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FOR INTERNAL USE. This SOP provides guidance on
capitalization of certain costs related to computer software developed or
obtained for internal use. The SOP is effective for financial statements for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998. Earlier application was
encouraged in fiscal years for which annual financial statements had not been
issued. The Company adopted the SOP effective January 1, 1998. The SOP causes
amounts that otherwise would have been charged to selling, general and
administrative expenses in the period incurred to be capitalized and amortized
over the useful life of the computer software, typically three to seven years.
During 1999 and 1998, $3,246,000 and $1,051,000, respectively, in costs were
capitalized by the Company pursuant to this SOP. For the years ended December
31, 1999 and 1998, the effect of this change in accounting was to increase net
income by $1,595,000 and $636,000, respectively, increase basic net income per
share by $010 and $004, respectively, and increase diluted net income per
share by $011 and $004, respectively. Amortization expense of $574,000 has
been recognized for the year ended December 31, 1999.
4 ACQUISITIONS
On July 1, 1997, the Company completed the acquisition of two information
technology services companies. The Company acquired the business operations of
Data Systems Technology, Inc., which had offices in Columbia and Greenville,
South Carolina, for $498,000, of which $134,000 was paid on July 1, 1997
including payoff of net assumed liabilities and $364,000 was paid on August
31, 1998 as a result of the acquired business attaining certain operating income
targets. The Company also acquired the business operations of Kansas City-based
J2, Inc., d.b.a. DP Career Associates DPCA for $52 million, of which $39
million was paid July 1, 1997 and $13 million was paid on February 27, 1998 as
a result of the acquired business attaining certain gross profit targets. On
December 2                   Page 34 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of The Avery Group Avery, an
information technology services company with one office in the Palo Alto/Silicon
Valley area of California. The purchase price was approximately $11,849,000, of
which $11 million was paid at closing, $754,000 was paid in February 1999 based
on a net worth adjustment calculation performed in February 1999 and direct
costs of the acquisition were approximately $95,000.
On January 1, 1999, the Company acquired D.P. Specialists, Inc. and D.P.
Specialists Learning Center, LLC DPS collectively, information technology
consulting services and personnel staffing businesses located in El Segundo,
California and Woodbridge, New Jersey for a purchase price of approximately
$18,820,000, including direct costs of the acquisition of approximately $90,000
and an estimated earnout of $8,750,000 based on the acquired business attaining
certain operating income targets for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999.
The Company has made a preliminary allocation of a portion of the purchase price
to net tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair
values at the date of acquisition, with the excess purchase price over the fair
value assigned to goodwill. The following summarizes a preliminary allocation of
the purchase price based on January 1, 1999 asset and liability balances

7 LINE OF CREDIT FACILITIES
The Company maintains credit facilities of $125,000,000. The facilities
are provided in equal amounts of $35,000,000 by three banks and $20,000,000
by a fourth bank. The Company has borrowed $82,467,071 against these
facilities, leaving $42,532,929 available as of December 31, 1999. No amount
was outstanding under the facilities as of December 31, 1998. The facilities
mature in June 2004 and may be extended each year for an additional year.
Until June 2004, interest, but no principal, is payable monthly. The interest
rates on the Company facilities change from time to time. Two of the
facilities allow the Company to select among prime rate and London Interbank
Offered Rate LIBOR based interest rates while the other two have only LIBOR
based interest rates. All of the facilities have interest rates that increase
as the balance outstanding under the facilities increases. The Company has
selected LIBOR based rates and the rate on such borrowings ranged from 66%
to 69% on December 31, 1999. The facilities also contain fees, ranging from
0125% to 0380% annually, which are charged on the unused portion of the
facilities. The facilities are collateralized by accounts receivable of the
Company.
The credit facilities contain several covenants, including one requiring
the maintenance of a certain tangible net worth ratio, which limits the amount
of dividends that can be paid. The covenants also impose limits on incurring
other debt, limit the amount borrowed to a multiple of adjusted earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and require a certain debt
service coverage ratio to be maintained. Amounts advanced under the facilities
can be used for acquisitions and general working capital purposes. If earnings
fall or the Company incurs losses these covenants may prevent the Company from
borrowing the full amount of the credit facilities or trigger a default under
the credit facilities.
On March 20, 2000, the Company changed the terms of its line of credit
facilities. The change increased the Maximum Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio from
30 to 10 to 40 to 10 through September 30, 2001 and increased the Funded
Debt to Capitalization ratio through December 31, 2002.                   Page 38 8 INCOME TAXES
During 1997, 1998 and 1999, the Company was a C corporation for income tax
purposes. The provision for income taxes for 1997, 1998 and 1999 includes
federal and state income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of
temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets
and liabilities. The provision for income taxes consists of the following                             YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
1997     1998      1999

Total income tax expense.  $6,177,558  $9,533,849  $10,222,585
The 1997, 1998 and 1999 actual tax expense differs from the amount which
would be provided by applying the statutory federal rate to income before income
taxes primarily as a result of state income taxes. A reconciliation of the
statutory federal income tax rate and the effective rate is as follows                          YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

The components of the deferred tax asset and liability at December 31,
1998 and 1999 are as follows Current deferred tax asset:                1998        1999

Other deferred tax liabilities.      116,808      130,864
$732,195     $1,555,131
In assessing whether deferred tax assets may be realized, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred
taxes will not be realized. Based on the availability of carrybacks of future
deductible amounts to 1997, 1998 and 1999 taxable income and management
projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax
assets are deductible, management believes the existing net deductible temporary
differences will reverse during periods in which carrybacks are available and/or
in which the Company generates net taxable income. There can be no assurance,
however, that the Company will generate any income or any specific level of
continuing income in future years.                   Page 39 9 EARNINGS PER SHARE

SFAS NO. 123 DISCLOSURE
As permitted by SFAS No. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK BASED COMPENSATION, the
Company applies APB Opinion No. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES, to
account for its three stock-based compensation plans. In accordance with APB
Opinion No. 25, the Company recorded no compensation expense related to these
plans in 1997, 1998 and 1999. There is no compensation expense related to the
Metro Information Services, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP
because it qualifies as a non-compensatory plan under APB Opinion No. 25. There
was no compensation expense recorded for either of the stock option plans
discussed below because the exercise price of each option equaled the fair value
of the underlying common stock as of the grant date. If compensation expense for
the Company three stock-based compensation plans had been determined based on
the fair value of the underlying option at the grant dates as calculated in
accordance with SFAS No. 123, the Company net income and net income per share
for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999 would have been reduced to
the pro forma amounts indicated below.                                  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in the pro forma net income and net income per

options' vesting periods.
OUTSIDE DIRECTORS STOCK PLAN
On December 24, 1996, the Company adopted a non-qualified stock option
plan the Outside Directors Stock Plan for the outside directors of the
Company. Each outside director is granted an option for 3,000 shares of Common
Stock on such director initial election. At each Annual Meeting thereafter,
such director is granted an additional option for 1,000 shares of Common Stock.
The options granted to outside directors are immediately exercisable in full at
a price equal to the fair market value of Common Stock on the date of grant. The
options expire 10 years after the date of grant or one year after the outside
director is no longer a director of the Company, whichever is earlier. The
Company has reserved 50,000 shares for issuance under this plan. During 1997,
1998 and 1999, the Outside Directors Stock Plan issued 8,000 options, 2,000
options and 2,000 options, respectively, to outside directors and no options
were exercised.
INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION PLAN
On December 24, 1996, the Company adopted the 1997 Employee Incentive
Stock Option Plan which provides for the grant of incentive stock options to
purchase up to an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock. In connection
with the initial public offering, certain employees of the Company were granted
options to purchase 374,300 shares of Common Stock at the initial public
offering price of $1600 per share. On various dates during 1998 and 1999,
certain employees of the Company were granted options to purchase 246,000
options and 762,000 options respectively, at the fair market value on the date
of grant. All of the options issued in 1997, 1998 and 1999 vest ratably over
either five or three years and expire not later than nine years and 11 months
after the date of grant.
The fair value of options at the date of grant was estimated using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
The Company adopted the ESPP on December 24, 1996. Under the ESPP, an
aggregate of 500,000 shares of Common Stock may be purchased from the Company by
the employees through payroll withholding pursuant to a series of offerings. All
full-time employees who have met certain service requirements as defined in the
ESPP, except for employees who own Common Stock of the Company or options on
such stock which represent more than 5% of Common Stock of the Company, are
eligible to participate. The purchase price of Common Stock is 85% of the lesser
of the fair market value of Common Stock on the first trading day of the
calendar quarter and the last trading day of the quarter. During 1997, 1998 and
1999, the Company sold 19,984, 53,106 and 128,102 shares, respectively, of
Common Stock to the ESPP for a total of $351,937, $1,323,056 and $1,603,143,
respectively.
The fair value of the employees' purchase rights of ESPP shares was
estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions                        1997       1998       1999

approval. There are currently no issued or outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock.

Stock. In all other respects, the Common Stock and Redeemable Common Stock had
identical rights.
Redeemable Common Stock was offered to key members of management under
individual stock purchase agreements annually on April 1 and the individuals had
30 days to purchase the stock. The number of shares offered was determined by
the Company president based on the prior fiscal year operating income and
each individual performance in that year. The purchase price was determined by
a formula based on operating income.                   Page 43 14 INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
