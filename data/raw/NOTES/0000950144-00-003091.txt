NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS
DBT Online, Inc., through its subsidiaries collectively referred to as the
Company, is engaged in the electronic information retrieval industry, which
provides online, real-time access to public records. The Company, through its
Patlex Corporation Patlex subsidiary, is involved in the patent enforcement
and exploitation business, whereby the Company collects royalty fees from a
group of laser patents.
1.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION. The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of DBT Online, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.
USE OF ESTIMATES. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with a remaining original maturity at the date of purchase of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. Property and equipment is recorded at cost and
depreciated using accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Useful lives range from 3 to 10 years. Expenditures for routine
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
PATENTS AND GOODWILL. The patent costs are amortized on a straight-line
basis over the remaining lives of the patents. Goodwill is amortized on a
straight-line basis over 7 to 10 years.
CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. Management reviews long-lived assets
for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If there is an indication of
impairment, management prepares an estimate of future cash flows undiscounted
and without interest charges expected to result from the use of the asset and
its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount
of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its
estimated fair value. Assets, if any, that management has committed to a plan to
dispose, whether by sale or abandonment, are reported at the lower of carrying
amount or fair value, less cost to sell. Preparation of estimated expected
future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management best
estimate of assumptions concerning future conditions.
REVENUE RECOGNITION. The Company recognizes revenue at the time of customer
access. Accounts receivable are primarily with law enforcement agencies,
insurance companies, law firms, and other licensed investigation companies.
Patent royalties are recognized pursuant to license agreements that require the
licensees to periodically report activity to the Company.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK. The Company customers are numerous and
spread over a wide geographic area. As such, the Company believes that it does
not have an abnormal concentration of credit risk within any one market or any
one geographic area.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS. Costs for research and development
activities are expensed as incurred, and aggregated $5,567, $3,078, and $2,364
for years ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively.
INCOME TAXES. The Company provides for deferred taxes under an asset and
liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. The
objective of an asset and liability method is to establish deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting
basis and the tax basis of the Company assets and liabilities at enacted tax
rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. The carrying amounts of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value
due to their short-term nature. Short-term investments are classified as
available-for-sale and are carried at fair value.
NET INCOME PER SHARE. Basic net income per share is determined by dividing
net income by the weighted-average shares outstanding. Diluted net income per
share is determined by dividing net income by the weighted-average shares
outstanding including the effect of stock options, if dilutive. The
weighted-average number of shares for stock options included in the diluted
weighted-average shares outstanding were 977,300, 711,900 and 917,300 in 1999,
1998, and 1997, respectively.                    -32-

Comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 is
as follows                         1999    1998     1997
Net income                   $2,808   $6,896    $6,101

Comprehensive income              $2,553   $6,896    $6,101
3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
On September 24, 1999, the Company acquired KnowX.com and Informed from
Information America, Inc. for $25,000 in cash and warrants to purchase 329,172
shares of common stock of the Company. The warrants, which had a total fair
value of $458 upon issuance, have an exercise price of $5250 per share and
expire on March 24, 2001. KnowX.com is a leading Internet-based public record
research tool for consumers and small office users. The Informed product line
offers qualified users, including commercial lending and leasing companies,
access to public information through the Internet or dial-up modems. The
transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the Company results of
operations include the results of KnowX.com and Informed since the date of
acquisition. Goodwill resulting from this transaction is approximately $24,709
and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over ten years.
Unaudited pro-forma results of operations, assuming the acquisition of
KnowX.com and Informed occurred as of the beginning of 1998, after giving effect
to certain adjustments such as interest and amortization of goodwill resulting
from the acquisition, are summarized as follows                         YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
1999       1998
Net revenue                  $ 88,803     $ 69,130
Income before income taxes          $ 2,179     $ 7,496
Net income                  $ 1,392     $ 4,894
Earnings per share diluted         $  007     $  025
On May 26, 1999, the Company acquired all of the common stock of WinSHAPES
for approximately $442 in cash plus the payment of liabilities in the amount of
$728. WinSHAPES is a company engaged in the development of software that
converts data into graphic illustrations that visualize interrelationships among
people, businesses, vehicles and other assets. The transaction was accounted for
as a purchase and the Company results of operations include the results of
WinSHAPES since the date of acquisition. Goodwill resulting from this
transaction was $1,190, and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over
seven years. Pro forma operating information is not provided for this
acquisition because its effects on the results of operations are not material.
On May 6, 1999, the Company merged with I.R.S.C., Inc. IRSC. IRSC is a
provider of court records and other public information used to conduct
pre-employment screening and other anti-fraud due diligence services for
business customers.
As a result of the IRSC merger, each share of IRSC common stock was
converted into the right to receive approximately 143 shares of Company common
stock, or 432,346 common shares of the Company in the aggregate. The IRSC merger
was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests and, accordingly, the Company
financial statements for periods prior to the IRSC merger have been restated to
include the results of IRSC for all periods presented. Results of operations for
the separate companies prior to the combination are as follows                    -33-

goodwill of approximately $5,800 in connection with this acquisition, which is
being amortized over seven years.

6. PATENTS
Patlex owns a 64% income interest in Laser Patent revenue relating to
certain patents involving laser technology. The most commercially significant of
the Laser Patents is the Gas Discharge Laser Patent U.S. Patent No. 4,704,583,
which covers gas discharge lasers. In addition, the Laser Patents consist of the
Brewster Angle Window Patent U.S. Patent No. 4,746,201, which involves the use
of an optical system, including optical elements, to polarize light. The Gas
Discharge Laser Patent expires in November 2004 and the Brewster Angle Window
Patent expires in May 2005. Upon the expiration of the applicable patent, Patlex
loses its right to exclude others from exploiting the inventions claimed therein
and, accordingly, the obligation of third parties to make royalty payments to
Patlex will cease.
7. INCOME TAXES

36   Deferred income taxes reflect the net income tax effects of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes, and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Annual changes
in these temporary differences constitute the principal reconciling items
between pretax accounting income and taxable income. Significant components of
the Company deferred tax liabilities and assets as of December 31, 1999 and
1998 are as follows                            AT DECEMBER 31,

Net deferred income tax liability       $1,580      $3,405
The Company has a capital loss carry-over of approximately $1,050 for tax
purposes, which expires in 2000. The related deferred tax asset, as of December
31, 1998, had been partially offset by a valuation allowance. However, as the
Company has initiated certain tax-planning strategies that it believes will
result in utilizing this loss carry-over, no valuation allowance is recorded as
of December 31, 1999.
The reconciliation of income tax computed at the federal statutory rate to
income tax expense is as follows                            YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
LITIGATION
The Company may be involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary
course of its business. The Company is not currently involved in any litigation,
or to its knowledge, is any litigation currently threatened that could have a
material effect on its financial position or results of operations.
The Company and the former chairman and principal shareholder of IRSC were
parties to a lawsuit against a group of eight companies that formerly conducted
business with IRSC. These eight companies alleged that IRSC was obligated to
enter into a merger agreement with them and that the former chairman of IRSC was
obligated to work for the company surviving the merger. The companies also
alleged that the Company interfered with the obligations of IRSC and its former
chairman by acquiring IRSC. When these companies threatened to sue, the Company
filed a lawsuit against them in state court in May 1999 to establish
jurisdiction of the action in Florida. Discovery was conducted from June 1999
until October 1999 at which time the parties entered into settlement
negotiations. A settlement agreement was entered into in January 2000. Pursuant
to a March 2, 2000 court order, the Company paid $250, which is included in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of December 31, 1999, as its portion
of the settlement.                    -36-
37   Due to the nature of Patlex business, and especially its involvement in
the enforcement of patent rights, Patlex is from time to time involved in
litigation with alleged infringers of the Laser Patents. Patlex regards all such
lawsuits as occurring in the ordinary course of business. Furthermore, as a
result of the involvement of the United States Patent and Trademark Office in
granting and denying patent applications and in conducting reexaminations of
patents, Patlex has in the past been required to prosecute appeals to the United
States District Court from Patent and Trademark Office rulings adverse to
Patlex interest. No such appeals are pending at this time, and Patlex does not
anticipate such appeals will be necessary in the future with regard to the Laser
Patents. In connection with suits filed against alleged patent infringers to
enforce a patent, defendants often file counterclaims seeking payment by the
plaintiffs of any damages suffered by the defendants on account of the lawsuit
and reimbursement by the plaintiffs of the defendant costs and attorney
fees. While such counterclaims have been filed against Patlex, to date Patlex
has not incurred liability with regard to such counterclaims. Patlex may also be
required to file suits to enforce collection and compliance under its patent
license agreements with its current licensees.
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS
In April 1997, the Company entered into an employment agreement with its
chairman, Mr. Borman, which provided for an initial three-year term commencing
on April 1, 1997 with automatic one-year extensions on the anniversary of the
commencement date, unless either the Company or Mr. Borman gives notice to the
other that the term of the agreement will not be extended. The employment
agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, including provisions relating
to non-competition, non-solicitation and the non-disclosure of proprietary
information, during the term of the agreement and for specified periods
thereafter. The 1999 annual compensation rate for Mr. Borman under this
agreement was $160.
In August 1997, the Company entered into an employment agreement with its
then CEO, Mr. Lieppe, which provided for a four-year term commencing August 15,
1997 and ending on August 14, 2001, unless terminated earlier in accordance with
certain circumstances. The 1999 annual compensation rate for Mr. Lieppe under
this agreement was $250. In August 1999, the Company and Mr. Lieppe agreed to
the terms of a Separation of Employment Agreement and General Release and
Consulting Agreement. In connection with this agreement, the Company is to pay
$425 in cash to Mr. Lieppe or on his behalf through December 2000. As of
December 31, 1999, $340 of this amount, representing the remaining unpaid
portion, was included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The Company
also incurred stock-based compensation expense of $771 in 1999 resulting from
the Company allowing Mr. Lieppe to vest in options after his termination date.
During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company agreed to the terms of
Separation of Employment Agreements and General Release and Consulting
Agreements with three other executives. Under the terms of these agreements, the
Company will pay $799 in cash to these executives or on their behalf for ten to
twelve months. The future payments under these agreements have been included in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of December 31, 1999.
In March 1998, the Company entered into an employment agreement with its
Vice President, Human Resources, Mr. Barr, which provides for a two-year term.
In October 1999, the employment agreement was amended for an additional year and
included a change in control provision. The annual compensation rate in 1999 for
Mr. Barr under this agreement was $150.
In August 1999, the Company entered into an employment agreement with its
current CEO, Mr. Fournet, that provides for a four-year term, unless terminated
earlier in accordance with certain circumstances, and which includes a change in
control provision. The annual compensation rate in 1999 for Mr. Fournet under
this agreement was $250.
In February 2000, the Company entered into an employment agreement with its
Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, Mr. Muetterties, having a
one-year term which renews each day. The agreement calls for a base salary of
$160 in 2000 and includes a change in control provision. The employment
agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, including provisions relating
to non-competition, non-solicitation and non-disclosure of confidential
information during the executive employment with the Company and for specific
periods thereafter.
LEASES
The Company leases all of its office space under agreements expiring on
various dates through 2008. These leases contain renewal options ranging from
3 to 10 years.
Future minimum payments under operating leases that have non-cancelable
terms in excess of one year are as follows                    -37-

The Company accounts for stock options issued to employees in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees. The Company employee stock options are issued with
exercise prices that equal the market price of the Company common stock on the
date of grant and, consequently, no compensation expense is recognized.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS No. 123
requires entities that account for awards for stock-based compensation to
employees in accordance with APB No. 25 to present pro forma disclosures of net
income and earnings per share as if compensation cost was measured at the date
of grant based on the fair value of the award. The fair value for these options
was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model
with the following weighted-average assumptions                                    1999       1998     1997

Weighted-average expected life                5 years    5 years    5 years   The weighted-average fair value per option granted during 1999, 1998 and
1997 was $1441, $1090 and $793, respectively.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the option vesting period. The Company
net income and net income per share diluted would have been reduced to the
following pro forma amounts for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and
1997, as follows                                1999      1998      1997
Net income
As reported                   $ 2,808     $6,896     $6,101
Pro forma                    $1,462    $3,629     $4,081
Net income per share diluted
As reported                   $ 014     $ 035     $ 033
Pro forma                    $ 007    $ 019     $ 022   The above pro forma amounts reflect the effect of stock options granted
subsequent to January 1, 1996. Accordingly, the pro forma amounts may not be
representative of the future effects on reported net income and earnings per
share that will result from the future granting of stock options, since the pro
forma compensation expense is allocated over the periods in which options become
exercisable and new option awards are granted each year.
During July 1999, the Company extended the exercise period for a retiring
Director stock options from 90 to 180 days. As a result, the Company incurred
$497 of stock-based compensation expense for the extension of these stock
options.                    -39-
40  BENEFIT PLAN
The Company has a 401k plan that is available to substantially all of its
employees. The Company provides a match of 66% of the employees' contribution,
with a maximum benefit of up to 4% of eligible compensation in the form of
Company common stock. Contribution expense was $333, $309 and $89 in 1999, 1998
and 1997, respectively.
10. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
IRSC had a consulting agreement with an affiliate which was terminated May
6, 1999. Pursuant to the agreement, IRSC paid the affiliate for consulting
services and reimbursed the affiliate for certain travel and administrative
expenses incurred on behalf of IRSC. During the years ended December 31, 1999,
1998 and 1997, IRSC paid the affiliate $63, $375 and $365, respectively.
Invemed Associates, Inc. Invemed, from time to time, has provided
financial advisory services to the Company, for which customary compensation has
been paid. In connection with the Company offering of 1,940,000 shares of
common stock in May 1997 and 5,669,758 shares in October 1999, Invemed performed
certain investment banking services for the Company for which Invemed received
fees of $2,706 and $3,975, respectively. The applicable portion of these fees
was offset against the capital funds received by the Company for the offerings.
Kenneth G. Langone, a director and a shareholder of the Company, is Chairman of
the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President of Invemed, and is the
principal shareholder of Invemed parent.
On February 7, 1994, the Company entered into a debt and royalty agreement
with a consortium of seven individuals including Jack Hight. During 1995, Mr.
Hight became a shareholder and director of the Company. The agreement provided
the financing necessary for the Company to enter the Texas market, and provided
for a loan to the Company of $200, which was repaid in 1995. The agreement also
provided for the Company to grant to the consortium a royalty to share in the
revenues of the Texas expansion up to $800, computed as 10% of specified
revenues from Texas operations. For the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and
1997, the Company paid $149, $165 and $126, respectively, relating to such
royalties. Through December 31, 1999, the Company had paid a total of $500
relating to such royalties.
The Chief Executive Officer and President and the Vice President, Human
Resources have outstanding loans with the Company as of December 31, 1999 in the
amounts of $350 and $125, respectively.                    -40-

50 ANNUAL COMPENSATION
Annual cash compensation is comprised of base salary and bonus awards.
Salary determinations have not been based upon any specific criteria. The salary
levels of executive officers of the Company that were hired in 1999 were
established at the time the executives were hired. The Compensation Committee
approved the compensation levels of the newly hired executives taking into
consideration the Company objective of attracting outstanding executives to
join a relatively young and growing corporation. The salary levels of certain
other executive officers of the Company for 1999 were based on established
levels set by employment contracts previously entered into by the executive
officers.
Bonus awards made to executive officers in 1999 were based in part on
established minimums set by their employment agreements and in part upon the
Company achievement of performance targets. The Compensation Committee also
took into consideration the leadership provided by the Company executive
officers in managing the Company growth in 1999.
LONG-TERM COMPENSATION
The Compensation Committee believes that stock options are an important
component of compensation for executive officers of the Company because it
closely aligns the interests of management with those of the shareholders. Stock
options also provide an attractive compensation incentive in hiring new
executive officers. This policy of the Compensation Committee is carried out for
the Company by the Stock Option Plan Administration Committee, which has the
discretion to grant stock options to executive officers. The number of options
in each grant is not based on any specific criteria, but the Committee did
consider primarily the executive position, skills and achievements.
COMPENSATION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Ronald Fournet was named President and Chief Executive Officer of the
Company on August 10, 1999. His salary level of $250,000 for 1999 was
established by the Board of the Company. He received a sign-on bonus of $85,000
in 1999. Mr. Fournet compensation in 1999 was based upon the terms of the
employment agreement that was dated August 10, 1999.
DEDUCTIBILITY OF CERTAIN COMPENSATION
Section 162m of the Internal Revenue Code generally denies a federal
income tax deduction for certain compensation exceeding $1,000,000 paid to the
CEO or any of the four other highest paid executive officers, excluding among
other things certain performance-based compensation. Through December 31, 1999,
this provision has not affected the Company tax deductions, but the
Compensation Committee will continue to monitor the potential impact of section
162m on the Company ability to deduct executive compensation.
