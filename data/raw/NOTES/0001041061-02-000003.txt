tabular amounts in millions, except share data
Note 1 - Description of Business
TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc. and Subsidiaries collectively referred
to as TRICON or the Company is comprised of the worldwide operations of KFC, Pizza
Hut and Taco Bell the Concepts and is the world largest quick service restaurant
company based on the number of system units, with over 30,000 units in more than 100
countries and territories. Approximately 36% of our system units are located outside the
U.S. TRICON was created as an independent, publicly owned company on October 6, 1997 the
Spin-off Date via a tax-free distribution by our former parent, PepsiCo, Inc.
PepsiCo, of our Common Stock the Distribution or Spin-off to its shareholders.
References to TRICON throughout these Consolidated Financial Statements are made using
the first person notations of we, us or our. 
Through our widely-recognized Concepts, we develop, operate, franchise
and license a system of both traditional and non-traditional quick service restaurants.
Each Concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high
quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide
appealing, tasty and attractive food at competitive prices. Our traditional restaurants
feature dine-in, carryout and, in some instances, drive-thru or delivery service.
Non-traditional units, which are principally licensed outlets, include express units and
kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in non-traditional locations like
airports, gasoline service stations, convenience stores, stadiums, amusement parks and
colleges, where a full-scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient. We
are actively pursuing the strategy of multibranding, where two or more of our Concepts
are operated in a single restaurant unit. In addition, we are testing multibranding
options involving one of our Concepts and a restaurant concept not owned or affiliated
with TRICON. 
Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Our preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from the estimates. 
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Preparation. Intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Investments in businesses in which we
exercise significant influence but do not control are accounted for by the equity method.
Our share of the net income or loss of those unconsolidated affiliates and net foreign
exchange gains or losses are included in other income expense. 
Fiscal Year. Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December and,
as a result, a fifty-third week is added every five or six years. Fiscal year 2000
included 53 weeks. The first three quarters of each fiscal year consist of 12 weeks and
the fourth quarter consists of 17 weeks in fiscal years with 53 weeks and 16 weeks in
fiscal years with 52 weeks. Our subsidiaries operate on similar fiscal calendars with
period end dates suited to their businesses. The subsidiaries' period end dates are
within one week of TRICON period end date with the exception of our international
businesses, which close one period or one month earlier to facilitate consolidated
reporting. 
Reclassifications. We have reclassified certain items in the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for prior periods to be comparable
with the classification we adopted for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2001. These
reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net income. 42 Franchise and License Operations. We execute franchise or license
agreements for each point of distribution which sets out the terms of our arrangement
with the franchisee or licensee. Our franchise and certain license agreements require the
franchisee or licensee to pay an initial, non-refundable fee and continuing fees based
upon a percentage of sales. Subject to our approval and payment of a renewal fee, a
franchisee may generally renew the franchise agreement upon its expiration. 
We recognize initial fees as revenue when we have performed substantially
all initial services required by the franchise or license agreement, which is generally
upon opening of a store. We recognize continuing fees as earned with an appropriate
provision for estimated uncollectible amounts, which is included in franchise and license
expenses. We recognize renewal fees in income when a renewal agreement becomes effective.
We include initial fees collected upon the sale of a restaurant to a franchisee in
refranchising gains losses. Fees for development rights are capitalized and amortized
over the life of the development agreement. 
We incur expenses that benefit both our franchise and license communities
and their representative organizations and our company operated restaurants. These
expenses, along with other costs of sales and servicing of franchise and license
agreements are charged to general and administrative expenses as incurred. Certain direct
costs of our franchise and license operations are charged to franchise and license
expenses. These costs include provisions for estimated uncollectible fees, franchise and
license marketing funding, amortization expense for franchise related intangible assets
and certain other direct incremental franchise and license support costs. Franchise and
license expenses also includes rent income from subleasing restaurants to franchisees net
of the related occupancy costs. 
We monitor the financial condition of our franchisees and licensees and
record provisions for estimated losses on receivables when we believe that our
franchisees or licensees are unable to make their required payments. While we use the
best information available in making our determination, the ultimate recovery of recorded
receivables is also dependent upon future economic events and other conditions that may
be beyond our control. Included in franchise and license expenses are provisions for uncollectible franchise and license
receivables of $24 million, $30 million and $2 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. 
Direct Marketing Costs. We report substantially all of our direct
marketing costs in occupancy and other operating expenses. We charge direct marketing
costs to expense ratably in relation to revenues over the year in which incurred and, in
the case of advertising production costs, in the year first shown. Deferred direct
marketing costs, which are classified as prepaid expenses, consist of media and related
advertising production costs which will generally be used for the first time in the next
fiscal year. To the extent we participate in independent advertising cooperatives, we
expense our contributions as incurred. At the end of 2001 and 2000, we had deferred
marketing costs of $2 million and $8 million, respectively. Our advertising expenses were
$328 million, $325 million and $385 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses,
which we expense as incurred, were $28 million in 2001 and $24 million in both 2000 and
1999. 
Refranchising Gains Losses. Refranchising gains losses includes the
gains or losses from the sales of our restaurants to new and existing franchisees and the
related initial franchise fees, reduced by transaction costs and direct administrative
costs of refranchising. In executing our refranchising initiatives, we most often offer
groups of restaurants. We recognize gains on restaurant refranchisings when the sale
transaction closes, the franchisee has a minimum amount of the purchase price in at-risk
equity, and we are satisfied that the franchisee can meet its financial obligations. If
the criteria for gain recognition are not met, we defer the gain to the extent we have a
remaining financial obligation in connection with the sales transaction. Deferred gains
are recognized when these criteria are met or as our financial obligation is reduced. We
only consider stores held for disposal when they are expected to be sold at a loss. We
recognize estimated losses on restaurants to be refranchised and suspend depreciation and
amortization when: a we make a decision to refranchise; b the estimated fair value
less costs to sell is less than the carrying amount of the stores; c the stores can be
immediately removed from operations; and d the sale is probable within one year. When
we make a decision to retain a store previously held for refranchising, we revalue the
store at the lower of its net book value at our 43 original disposal decision date less normal depreciation and amortization during the period held for disposal or its current
fair market value. This value becomes the store new cost basis. We charge or credit
any difference between the store carrying amount and its new cost basis to
refranchising gains losses. When we make a decision to close a store previously held
for refranchising, we reverse any previously recognized refranchising loss and then
record the store closure costs as described below. For groups of restaurants expected to
be sold at a gain, we typically do not suspend depreciation and amortization until the
sale is probable. For practical purposes, we treat the closing date as the point at which
the sale is probable. Refranchising gains losses also include charges for estimated
exposures related to those partial guarantees of franchisee loan pools and contingent
lease liabilities which arose from refranchising activities. These exposures are more
fully discussed in Note 22. 
Store Closure Costs. We recognize the impairment of a restaurant assets
as store closure costs when we have closed or replaced the restaurant within the same
quarter our decision is made. Store closure costs also include costs of disposing of the
assets as well as other facility-related expenses from previously closed stores. These
costs are expensed as incurred. Additionally, at the date the closure is considered
probable, we record a liability for the net present value of any remaining operating
lease obligations subsequent to the expected closure date, net of estimated sublease
income, if any. 
Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash
flows, including sublease income. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly
from the estimates. 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. We review our long-lived assets related
to each restaurant to be held and used in the business, including any allocated
intangible assets, semi-annually for impairment, or whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable.
We evaluate restaurants using a two-year history of operating losses as our primary
indicator of potential impairment. Based on the best information available, we write down
an impaired restaurant to its estimated fair market value, which becomes its new cost
basis. We generally measure estimated fair market value by discounting estimated future
cash flows. In addition, when we decide to close a store beyond the quarter in which the
closure decision is made, it is reviewed for impairment and depreciable lives are
adjusted. The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated cash flows from continuing
use until the expected disposal date plus the expected terminal value. 
Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash
flows. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from our estimates. 
Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates and
Enterprise-Level Goodwill. Our methodology for determining and measuring impairment of
our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and enterprise-level goodwill is similar to
the methodology we use for our restaurants except: a the recognition test for an
investment in an unconsolidated affiliate compares the carrying amount of our investment
to a forecast of our share of the unconsolidated affiliate undiscounted cash flows
after interest and taxes instead of undiscounted cash flows before interest and taxes
used for our restaurants; and b enterprise-level goodwill is generally evaluated at a
country level instead of by individual restaurant. Also, we record impairment charges
related to investments in unconsolidated affiliates whenever other circumstances indicate
that a decrease in the value of an investment has occurred which is other than temporary. 
Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash
flows. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from our estimates. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents represent funds we have
temporarily invested with original maturities not exceeding three months as part of
managing our day-to-day operating cash receipts and disbursements. 
Inventories. We value our inventories at the lower of cost computed on
the first-in, first-out method or net realizable value. 44 Property, Plant and Equipment. We state property, plant and equipment at
cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, impairment writedowns and valuation
allowances. We calculate depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: 5 to 25 years for buildings and
improvements, 3 to 20 years for machinery and equipment and 3 to 7 years for capitalized
software costs. As discussed further above, we suspend depreciation and amortization on
assets related to restaurants that are held for disposal. 
Internal Development Costs and Abandoned Site Costs. We capitalize direct
costs associated with the site acquisition and construction of a Company unit on that
site, including direct internal payroll and payroll-related costs and direct external
costs. Only those site-specific costs incurred subsequent to the time that the site
acquisition is considered probable are capitalized. We consider acquisition probable upon
final site approval. If we subsequently make a determination that a site for which
internal development costs have been capitalized will not be acquired or developed, any
previously capitalized internal development costs are expensed and included in general
and administrative expenses. 
Intangible Assets. Intangible assets include both identifiable
intangibles and goodwill arising from the allocation of purchase prices of businesses
acquired. Where appropriate, intangible assets are allocated to individual restaurants at
the time of acquisition. We base amounts assigned to identifiable intangibles on
independent appraisals or internal estimates. Goodwill represents the residual purchase
price after allocation to all identifiable net assets. Our intangible assets are stated
at historical allocated cost less accumulated amortization and impairment writedowns. We
amortize intangible assets on a straight-line basis as follows: up to 20 years for
reacquired franchise rights, 3 to 40 years for trademarks and other identifiable
intangibles and up to 20 years for goodwill. As discussed above, we suspend amortization
on intangible assets allocated to restaurants that are held for disposal. 
See New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted for a discussion of
the anticipated impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 141,
Business Combinations SFAS 141 and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets SFAS 142 on our accounting for intangible assets. 
Stock-Based Employee Compensation. We measure stock-based employee
compensation cost for financial statement purposes in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
its related interpretations. We include pro forma information in Note 16 as required by
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123. Accordingly, we
measure compensation cost for stock option grants to employees as the excess of the
average market price of the Common Stock at the grant date over the amount the employee
must pay for the stock. Our policy is to generally grant stock options at the average
market price of the underlying Common Stock at the date of grant. 
Derivative Financial Instruments. Our policy prohibits the use of
derivative instruments for trading purposes, and we have procedures in place to monitor
and control their use. Our use of derivative instruments has included interest rate
swaps, collars, forward rate agreements and foreign currency forward contracts. In
addition, we utilize on a limited basis, commodity futures and options contracts. Our
interest rate and foreign currency derivative contracts are entered into with financial
institutions while our commodity derivative contracts are exchange traded. 
Effective December 31, 2000, we adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133. SFAS 133 requires that all
derivative instruments be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. The
accounting for changes in the fair value i.e., gains or losses of a derivative
instrument is dependent upon whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as
part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or
loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged
item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in the results of operations. For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a
component of other comprehensive income loss OCI and reclassified into earnings in
the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any
ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in the
results of operations immediately. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging
instruments, the gain or loss is recognized in the results of operations immediately. The
cumulative effect of adoption of SFAS 133 was 45 insignificant. For fiscal years prior to the adoption of SFAS 133, our treatment of derivative instruments was as described in the
following paragraphs. 
We recognized the interest differential to be paid or received on
interest rate swap and forward rate agreements as an adjustment to interest expense as
the differential occurred. We recognized the interest differential to be paid or received
on an interest rate collar as an adjustment to interest expense when the interest rate
fell below or rose above the collared range. We reflected the recognized interest
differential not yet settled in cash in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as a
current receivable or payable. 
Each period, we recognized in income foreign exchange gains and losses on
forward contracts that were designated and effective as hedges of foreign currency
receivables or payables as the differential occurred. These gains or losses were largely
offset by the corresponding gain or loss recognized in income on the currency translation
of the receivable or payable, as both amounts were based upon the same exchange rates. We
reflected the recognized foreign currency differential for forward contracts not yet
settled in cash on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets each period as a current
receivable or payable. Each period, we recognized in income the change in fair value of
foreign exchange gains and losses on forward contracts that were entered into to mitigate
the foreign exchange risk of certain forecasted foreign currency denominated royalty
receipts. We reflected the fair value of these forward contracts not yet settled on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as a current receivable or payable. If a foreign currency
forward contract was terminated prior to maturity, the gain or loss recognized upon
termination was immediately recognized in income. 
We deferred gains and losses on futures and options contracts that were
designated and effective as hedges of future commodity purchases and included them in the
cost of the related raw materials when purchased. Changes in the value of futures and
options contracts that we used to hedge components of our commodity purchases were highly
correlated to changes in the value of the purchased commodity attributable to the hedged
component. 
New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted. In 2001, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS 141, which supersedes APB Opinion No. 16,
Business Combinations. SFAS 141 eliminates the pooling-of-interests method of
accounting for business combinations and modifies the application of the purchase
accounting method. SFAS 141 also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a
purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately
from goodwill. The provisions of SFAS 141 were effective for transactions accounted for
using the purchase method that were completed after June 30, 2001. Such transactions were
not significant for the Company through December 29, 2001. 
Historically, the Company business combinations have primarily
consisted of acquiring restaurants from our franchisees and have been accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting. The primary intangible asset to which we have
generally allocated value in these business combinations is reacquired franchise rights.
We have determined that reacquired franchise rights do not meet the criteria of SFAS 141
to be recognized as an asset apart from goodwill. 
In 2001, the FASB also issued SFAS 142, which supersedes APB Opinion No.
17, Intangible Assets. SFAS 142 eliminates the requirement to amortize goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets, addresses the amortization of intangible assets with
a defined life, and addresses impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and
intangible assets. SFAS 142 applies to goodwill and intangible assets arising from
transactions completed before and after its effective date. SFAS 142 is effective for the
Company for fiscal year 2002. 
If SFAS 142 had been effective for fiscal year 2001, the cessation of
amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles would have resulted in our
reported net income being approximately $26 million higher. We have not yet determined
the impact of the transitional goodwill impairment test, which is required to be
performed in connection with to the adoption of SFAS 142. 46 In 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations SFAS 143, which will be effective for the Company beginning fiscal year
2003. SFAS 143 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset
retirement costs. We have not yet determined the impact of adopting SFAS 143 on the
Company Financial Statements. 
In 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144 which supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of
SFAS 121 and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB No. 30, Reporting the
Results of Operations -- Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business,
and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions for the
disposal of a segment of a business. SFAS 144 retains many of the fundamental provisions
of SFAS 121, but resolves certain implementation issues associated with that Statement.
SFAS 144 is effective for the Company for fiscal year 2002. We do not anticipate that the
adoption of SFAS 144 will have a significant impact on our results of operations.

Includes favorable adjustments of $19 million in the U.S. and unfavorable adjustments of $6 million in International related
to our 1997 fourth quarter charge. These adjustments primarily related to lower-than-expected losses from stores disposed of,
decisions to retain certain stores originally expected to be disposed of and changes in estimated costs. The original fourth
quarter 1997 charge included estimates for the costs of closing stores; reductions to fair market value, less costs to sell, of
the carrying amounts of certain restaurants we intended to refranchise; and impairments of certain restaurants intended to be
used in the business.
Includes initial franchise fees in the U.S. of $4 million in 2001, $17 million in 2000 and $38 million in 1999 and in
International of $3 million in both 2001 and 2000 and $7 million in 1999. See Note 7.
In 2001, U.S. refranchising net gains included $12 million of previously deferred refranchising gains and International
refranchising net losses gains included a charge of $11 million to mark to market the net assets of the Singapore business,
which is held for sale. 48 Impairment charges for 2001, 2000 and 1999 were recorded against the following asset categories                              2001     2000     1999

Unusual items income in 2001 primarily included: a recoveries of
approximately $21 million related to the AmeriServe Food Distribution Inc. AmeriServe
bankruptcy reorganization process; b aggregate settlement costs of $15 million
associated with certain litigation; and c expenses, primarily severance, related to
decisions to streamline certain support functions. See Note 22 for discussions of the
AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process and litigation. 
In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded expenses of approximately $4
million related to streamlining certain support functions, which included the termination
of approximately 90 employees. The reserves established, which primarily related to
severance, were almost fully utilized in the first quarter of 2002. 
Unusual items expense in 2000 included: a $170 million of charges and
direct incremental costs related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process; b
an increase in the estimated costs of settlement of certain wage and hour litigation and
associated defense costs incurred in 2000; c costs associated with the formation of new
unconsolidated affiliates; and d the reversal of excess provisions arising from the
resolution of a dispute associated with the disposition of our Non-core Businesses, which
is discussed in Note 22. 
Unusual items expense in 1999 included: a the write-off of
approximately $41 million owed to us by AmeriServe at the AmeriServe bankruptcy petition
date; b an increase in the estimated costs of settlement of certain wage and hour
litigation and associated defense and other costs incurred in 1999; c favorable
adjustments to our 1997 fourth quarter charge; d the write-down to estimated fair
market value less cost to sell of our idle Wichita processing facility; e costs
associated with the formation of new unconsolidated affiliates; f the impairment of
enterprise-level goodwill in one of our international businesses; and g severance and
other exit costs related to strategic decisions to streamline the infrastructure of our
international business. The original fourth quarter 1997 charge included impairments of
certain investments in unconsolidated affiliates to be retained and costs of certain
personnel reductions. 50 Accounting Changes 
In 1998 and 1999, we adopted several accounting and human resource policy
changes collectively, the accounting changes which favorably impacted our 1999
operating results by approximately $29 million. The estimated impact is summarized below:                          1999
General and
Restaurant    Administrative    Operating
Margin       Expenses      Profit
U.S.         $    11    $     4     $    15
Unallocated           -         14          14
Total         $    11    $    18     $    29
The accounting changes were as follows: 
Effective December 27, 1998, we adopted Statement of Position 98-1 SOP
98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal
Use. Based on our adoption of SOP 98-1, we capitalized approximately $13 million of
internal software development costs and third party software costs in 1999. The
amortization of computer software assets that became ready for their intended use in 1999
was insignificant. 
In addition, we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 97-11 EITF
97-11, Accounting for Internal Costs Relating to Real Estate Property Acquisitions,
upon its issuance in March 1998. In the first quarter of 1999, we also made a
discretionary policy change limiting the types of costs eligible for capitalization to
those direct cost types described as capitalizable under SOP 98-1. This change
unfavorably impacted our 1999 operating profit by approximately $3 million. 
To conform to the Securities and Exchange Commission April 23, 1998
interpretation of SFAS 121 our store closure accounting policy was changed in 1998.
Effective for closure decisions made on or subsequent to April 23, 1998, we recognize
store closure costs when we have closed the restaurant within the same quarter the
closure decision is made. When we decide to close a restaurant beyond the quarter in
which the closure decision is made, we review it for impairment. In fiscal year 1999,
this change resulted in additional depreciation and amortization of approximately $3
million through April 23, 1999. 
In 1999, the methodology used by our independent actuary was refined and
enhanced to provide a more reliable estimate of the self-insured portion of our current
and prior years' ultimate loss projections related to workers' compensation, general
liability and automobile liability insurance programs. The change in methodology resulted
in a one-time increase in our 1999 operating profit of over $8 million. 
At the end of 1998, we changed our method of determining the pension
discount rate to better reflect the assumed investment strategies we would most likely
use to invest any short-term cash surpluses. The pension discount methodology change
resulted in a one-time increase in our 1999 operating profit of approximately $6 million. 
In 1999, our vacation policies were conformed to a calendar-year based,
earn-as-you-go, use-or-lose policy. The change provided a one-time favorable increase in
our 1999 operating profit of approximately $7 million. Other accounting policy
standardization changes by our three U.S. Concepts provided a one-time favorable increase
in our 1999 operating profit of approximately $1 million. 51 Note 6 - Supplemental Cash Flow Data                                2001      2000      1999

Our primary bank credit agreement, as amended, is comprised of a senior
unsecured Term Loan Facility and a $175 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit
Facility, which was reduced from $3 billion as part of the amendment discussed below
collectively referred to as the Credit Facilities. The Credit Facilities mature on
October 2, 2002. Amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility are expected to
fluctuate, but Term Loan Facility reductions may not be reborrowed. 53 Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, we may borrow up to
the maximum borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit. At December
29, 2001, we had unused Revolving Credit Facilities aggregating $27 billion, net of
outstanding letters of credit of $02 billion. We expensed facility fees on the Revolving
Credit Facility of approximately $4 million in each of 2001, 2000 and 1999. Amounts outstanding under our Credit Facilities at December 29, 2001 have
been classified as short-term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheet due to the
October 2002 maturity. We are currently in negotiations to replace the Credit Facilities
prior to the maturity date with new borrowings, which will reflect the market conditions
and terms available at that time. 
The Credit Facilities are subject to various covenants including
financial covenants relating to maintenance of specific leverage and fixed charge
coverage ratios. In addition, the Credit Facilities contain affirmative and negative
covenants including, among other things, limitations on certain additional indebtedness,
guarantees of indebtedness, cash dividends, aggregate non-U.S. investment and certain
other transactions, as defined in the agreement. The Credit Facilities require prepayment
of a portion of the proceeds from certain capital market transactions and refranchising
of restaurants. 
Interest on amounts borrowed is payable at least quarterly at variable
rates, based principally on the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus a variable
margin factor. At December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000, the weighted average interest
rate on our variable rate debt was 34% and 72%, respectively, which includes the
effects of associated interest rate swaps. See Note 14 for a discussion of our use of
derivative instruments, our management of credit risk inherent in derivative instruments
and fair value information related to debt and interest rate swaps. 
On February 22, 2002, we entered into an agreement to amend certain terms
of our Credit Facilities. This amendment provides for, among other things, additional
flexibility with respect to acquisitions and other investments. In addition, we
voluntarily reduced our maximum borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility from $30
billion to $175 billion. As a result of this amendment, we capitalized debt costs of
approximately $15 million. These costs will be amortized into interest expense over the
remaining life of the Credit Facilities. 
In 1997, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission with respect to offerings of up to $2 billion of senior unsecured
debt. In May 1998, we issued $350 million of 745% Unsecured Notes due May 15, 2005
2005 Notes and $250 million of 765% Unsecured Notes due May 15, 2008 2008 Notes.
Interest on the 2005 Notes and 2008 Notes commenced on November 15, 1998 and is payable
semi-annually thereafter. The effective interest rate on the 2005 Notes and the 2008
Notes is 76% and 78%, respectively. In April 2001, we issued $200 million of 85%
Senior Unsecured Notes due April 15, 2006 2006 Notes and $650 million of 8875%
Senior Unsecured Notes due April 15, 2011 2011 Notes collectively referred to as the
Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were used to reduce amounts
outstanding under the Credit Facilities. Interest on the Notes is payable April 15 and
October 15 and commenced on October 15, 2001. The effective interest rate on the 2006
Notes and the 2011 Notes is 90% and 92%, respectively. We still have $550 million
available for issuance under the $2 billion shelf registration statement. 
Interest expense on the short-term borrowings and long-term debt was $172
million, $190 million and $218 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Net interest
expense of $9 million on incremental borrowings related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy
reorganization process was included in unusual items in 2000. 
The annual maturities of long-term debt through 2006 and thereafter,
excluding capital lease obligations and the derivative instrument adjustments, are 2002 537 million; 2003 - $1 million; 2004 - $1 million; 2005 - $351 million; 2006 - $200
million and $900 million thereafter. 54 Note 13 - Leases
We have non-cancelable commitments under both capital and long-term
operating leases, primarily for our restaurants. Capital and operating lease commitments
expire at various dates through 2087 and, in many cases, provide for rent escalations and
renewal options. Most leases require us to pay related executory costs, which include
property taxes, maintenance and insurance. 
Future minimum commitments and amounts to be received as lessor or
sublessor under non-cancelable leases are set forth below:                  Commitments           Lease Receivables

At year-end 2001, the present value of minimum payments under capital leases was $79 million.
The details of rental expense and income are set forth below   
2001      2000      1999

$   293   $   281    $   291
Minimum rental income  $   14   $   18    $   20
Contingent rentals are generally based on sales levels in excess of
stipulated amounts contained in the lease agreements. 
During 2001, we entered into sale-leaseback transactions involving 17 of
our restaurants. Under the transactions, the restaurants were sold for approximately $18
million and have been leased back for initial terms of 15 years. These leasebacks have
been accounted for as operating leases. The future lease payments are included in the
above tables. Gains on the sales, which were not significant, were deferred and will be
amortized to rent expense over the initial term of the leases. 55 Note 14 - Financial Instruments
Derivative Instruments 
Interest Rates - We enter into interest rate swaps, collars and forward
rate agreements with the objective of reducing our exposure to interest rate risk and
lowering interest expense for a portion of our debt. Under the contracts, we agree with
other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between variable rate
and fixed rate amounts calculated on a notional principal amount. At December 29, 2001
and December 30, 2000 we had outstanding pay-variable interest rate swaps with notional
amounts of $350 million. These swaps have reset dates and floating rate indices which
match those of our underlying fixed-rate debt and have been designated as fair value
hedges of a portion of that debt. As the swaps qualify for the short-cut method under
SFAS 133 no ineffectiveness has been recorded. The fair value of these swaps as of
December 29, 2001 was approximately $36 million and has been included in Other assets.
The portion of this fair value which has not yet been recognized as a reduction to
interest expense approximately $34 million at December 29, 2001 has been included in
Long-term debt. 
At December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000, we also had outstanding
pay-fixed interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $650 million and $450 million,
respectively. These swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of a portion of our
variable-rate debt. As the critical terms of the swaps and hedged interest payments are
the same, we have determined that the swaps are completely effective in offsetting the
variability in cash flows associated with interest payments on that debt due to interest
rate fluctuations. 
During 2000, we entered into interest rate collars to reduce interest
rate sensitivity on a portion of our variable rate bank debt. Interest rate collars
effectively lock in a range of interest rates by establishing a cap and floor. Reset
dates and the floating index on the collars match those of the underlying bank debt. If
interest rates remain within the collared cap and floor, no payments are made. If rates
rise above the cap level, we receive a payment. If rates fall below the floor level, we
make a payment. At December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000, we did not have any
outstanding interest rate collars. 
Foreign Exchange - We enter into foreign currency forward contracts with
the objective of reducing our exposure to cash flow volatility arising from foreign
currency fluctuations associated with certain foreign currency denominated financial
instruments, the majority of which are intercompany short-term receivables and payables.
The notional amount, maturity date, and currency of these contracts match those of the
underlying receivables or payables. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts
to reduce our cash flow volatility associated with certain forecasted foreign currency
denominated royalties. These forward contracts have historically been short-term in
nature, with termination dates matching forecasted settlement dates of the receivables or
payables or cash receipts from royalties within the next twelve months. For those foreign
currency exchange forward contracts that we have designated as cash flow hedges, we
measure ineffectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in the forward contract with
the cumulative change in the hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates. No
ineffectiveness was recognized in 2001 for those foreign currency forward contracts
designated as cash flow hedges. 
Commodities - We also utilize on a limited basis commodity futures and
options contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price fluctuations over the next
twelve months. Those contracts have not been designated as hedges under SFAS 133. There
were no open commodity future and options contracts outstanding at December 29, 2001 and
those outstanding as of the adoption of SFAS 133 on December 31, 2000 were not
significant. 
Deferred Amounts in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Loss - As of
December 29, 2001, we had a net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of
approximately $1 million, net of tax. Of this amount, we estimate that a net after-tax
gain of less than $1 million will be reclassified into earnings through December 28,
2002. The remaining net after-tax loss of approximately $1 million, which arose from the
settlement of treasury locks entered into prior to the issuance of certain amounts of our
fixed-rate debt, will be reclassified into earnings from December 29, 2002 through 2011
as an increase to interest expense on this debt. 56 Credit Risks 
Our credit risk from the interest rate swap, collar and forward rate
agreements and foreign exchange contracts is dependent both on the movement in interest
and currency rates and possibility of non-payment by counterparties. We mitigate credit
risk by entering into these agreements with high-quality counterparties, netting swap and
forward rate payments within contracts and limiting payments associated with the collars
to differences outside the collared range. 
Accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts due from franchisees
and licensees for initial and continuing fees. In addition, we have notes and lease
receivables from certain of our franchisees. The financial condition of these franchisees
and licensees is largely dependent upon the underlying business trends of our Concepts.
This concentration of credit risk is mitigated, in part, by the large number of
franchisees and licensees of each Concept and the short-term nature of the franchise and
license fee receivables. 
Fair Value 
At December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000, the fair values of cash and
cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable
approximated carrying value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The
fair value of notes receivable approximate carrying value after consideration of recorded
allowances. 
The carrying amounts and fair values of our other financial instruments
subject to fair value disclosures are as follows:                                2001          2000

Note 15 - Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits
Pension Benefits 
We sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering
substantially all full-time U.S. salaried employees, certain hourly employees and certain
international employees. During 2001, the TRICON Retirement Plan the Plan was amended
such that any salaried employee hired or rehired by TRICON after September 30, 2001 will
not be eligible to participate in the Plan. Benefits are based on years of service and
earnings or stated amounts for each year of service. 57 Postretirement Medical Benefits 
Our postretirement plan provides health care benefits, principally to
U.S. salaried retirees and their dependents. This plan includes retiree cost sharing
provisions. During 2001, the plan was amended such that any salaried employee hired or
rehired by TRICON after September 30, 2001 will not be eligible to participate in this plan.
Employees hired prior to September 30, 2001 are eligible for benefits if they meet
age and service requirements and qualify for retirement benefits.

rates for non-Medicare and Medicare eligible retirees will decrease to an ultimate rate
of 55% by 2008 and 2010, respectively, and remain at that level thereafter. There is a
cap on our medical liability for certain retirees. The cap for Medicare eligible retirees
was reached in 2000 and the cap for non-Medicare eligible retirees is expected to be
reached between the years 2010-2012; once the cap is reached, our annual cost per retiree
will not increase. 
Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the
amounts reported for our postretirement health care plans. A one percent increase or
decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have increased or decreased
our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 29, 2001 by approximately
$3 million. The impact on our 2001 benefit cost would not have been significant. 
Note 16 -Employee Stock-Based Compensation
At year-end 2001, we had four stock option plans in effect: the TRICON
Global Restaurants, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan 1999 LTIP, the 1997 Long-Term
Incentive Plan 1997 LTIP, the TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc. Restaurant General
Manager Stock Option Plan YUMBUCKS and the TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc. SharePower
Plan SharePower. 
We may grant awards of up to 76 million shares and 225 million shares
of stock under the 1999 LTIP and 1997 LTIP, respectively. Potential awards to employees
and non-employee directors under the 1999 LTIP include stock options, incentive stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock units, restricted stock
units, performance shares and performance units. Potential awards to employees and
non-employee directors under the 1997 LTIP include stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock and performance restricted stock units. Prior to January 1, 2002, we also could
grant stock options and incentive stock options under the 1997 LTIP. We have issued only
stock options and performance restricted stock units under the 1997 LTIP and have issued
only stock options under the 1999 LTIP. We may grant stock options under the 1999 LTIP to purchase shares at a
price equal to or greater than the average market price of the stock on the date of
grant. New option grants under the 1999 LTIP can have varying vesting provisions and
exercise periods. Previously granted options under the 1997 LTIP and 1999 LTIP vest in
periods ranging from immediate to 2006 and expire ten to fifteen years after grant. 
We may grant options to purchase up to 75 million shares of stock under
YUMBUCKS at a price equal to or greater than the average market price of the stock on the
date of grant. YUMBUCKS options granted have a four year vesting period and expire ten
years after grant. We may grant options to purchase up to 70 million shares of stock at
a price equal to or greater than the average market price of the stock under SharePower
on the date of grant. SharePower grants have not been made since Spin-off. Previously
granted SharePower options could be outstanding through 2006. 60 At the Spin-off Date, we converted certain of the unvested options to
purchase PepsiCo stock that were held by our employees to TRICON stock options under
either the 1997 LTIP or SharePower. We converted the options at amounts and exercise
prices that maintained the amount of unrealized stock appreciation that existed
immediately prior to the Spin-off. The vesting dates and exercise periods of the options
were not affected by the conversion. Based on their original PepsiCo grant date, our
converted options vest in periods ranging from one to ten years and expire ten to fifteen
years after grant.

We estimated the fair value of each option grant made during 2001, 2000
and 1999 as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the

In November 1997, we granted two awards of performance restricted stock
units of TRICON Common Stock to our Chief Executive Officer CEO. The awards were
made under the 1997 LTIP and may be paid in Common Stock or cash at the discretion of the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Payment of an award of $27 million was
contingent upon the CEO continued employment through January 25, 2001 and our
attainment of certain pre-established earnings thresholds, as defined. In January 2001,
our CEO received a cash payment of $27 million following the Compensation Committee
certification of TRICON attainment of the pre-established earnings threshold. Payment
of an award of $36 million is contingent upon his employment through January 25, 2006
and our attainment of certain pre-established earnings thresholds, as defined. The annual
expense related to these awards included in earnings was $05 million for 2001 and $13
million for both 2000 and 1999. 
During 2000 and 1999, modifications were made to certain 1997 LTIP and
SharePower options held by terminated employees. These modifications resulted in
additional compensation expense of an insignificant amount in 2000 and $50 million in
1999 with a corresponding increase in our Common Stock account. 62 Note 17 - Other Compensation and Benefit Programs
We sponsor two deferred compensation benefit programs, the Restaurant
Deferred Compensation Plan and the Executive Income Deferral Program the RDC Plan and
the EID Plan, respectively for eligible employees and non-employee directors. 
Effective October 1, 2001, participants can no longer defer funds into
the RDC Plan. Prior to that date, the RDC Plan allowed participants to defer a portion of
their annual salary. The participant balances will remain in the RDC Plan until their
scheduled distribution dates. As defined by the RDC Plan, we credit the amounts deferred
with earnings based on the investment options selected by the participants. Investment
options in the RDC Plan consist of phantom shares of various mutual funds and TRICON
Common Stock. We recognize compensation expense for the appreciation or depreciation, if
any, attributable to all investments in the RDC Plan as well as for our matching
contribution. Our obligations under the RDC program as of the end of 2001 and 2000 were
$13 million and $10 million, respectively. We recognized annual compensation expense of
$3 million in 2001 and $1 million in both 2000 and 1999 for the RDC Plan. 
The EID Plan allows participants to defer receipt of a portion of their
annual salary and all or a portion of their incentive compensation. As defined by the EID
Plan, we credit the amounts deferred with earnings based on the investment options
selected by the participants. The EID Plan includes an investment option that allows
participants to defer incentive compensation to purchase phantom shares of our Common
Stock at a 25% discount from the average market price at the date of deferral the
Discount Stock Account. Participants bear the risk of forfeiture of both the discount
and any amounts deferred if they voluntarily separate from employment during the two year
vesting period. We expense the intrinsic value of the discount over the vesting period. 
We phased in certain program changes to the EID Plan during 1999 and
2000. These changes included limiting investment options, primarily to cash and phantom
shares of our Common Stock, and requiring the distribution of investments in the TRICON
Common Stock investment options to be paid in shares of our Common Stock. Due to these
changes, in 1998 we agreed to credit a one time premium to participant accounts on
January 1, 2000. The premium totaled approximately $3 million and was equal to 10% of the
participants' account balances as of December 31, 1999, excluding a investments in the
Discount Stock Account and b deferrals made in 1999. 
Subsequent to January 1, 1999, we no longer recognize as compensation
expense the appreciation or depreciation, if any, attributable to investments in the
Discount Stock Account since these investments can only be settled in shares of our
Common Stock. We also reduced our liabilities by $21 million related to investments in
the Discount Stock Account and increased the Common Stock Account by the same amount at
January 1, 1999. 
Subsequent to January 1, 2000, we no longer recognize as compensation
expense the appreciation or depreciation, if any, attributable to investments in the
phantom shares of our Common Stock, since these investments can only be settled in shares
of our Common Stock. For 1999, we recorded a benefit of $3 million related to
depreciation of investments in phantom shares of our Common Stock impacted by the January
2000 plan amendment. We also reduced our liabilities by $12 million related to
investments in the phantom shares of our Common Stock and increased the Common Stock
Account by the same amount at January 1, 2000. 
Our cash obligations under the EID Plan as of the end of 2001 and 2000
were $24 million and $27 million, respectively. We recognized compensation expense of $4
million in 2001 and $6 million in both 2000 and 1999 for the EID Plan. 63 We sponsor a contributory plan to provide retirement benefits under the
provisions of Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code the 401k Plan for
eligible full-time U.S. salaried and certain hourly employees. Participants may elect to
contribute up to 15% of eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis. Effective October 1,
2001 the 401k Plan was amended such that the Company matches 100% of the participant
contribution up to 3% of eligible compensation and 50% of the participant contribution
on the next 2% of eligible compensation. Prior to this amendment, we made a discretionary
matching contribution equal to a predetermined percentage of each participant
contribution to the TRICON Common Stock Fund. We determined our percentage match at the
beginning of each year based on the immediate prior year performance of our Concepts. All
matching contributions are made to the TRICON Common Stock Fund. We recognized as
compensation expense our total matching contribution of $5 million in 2001 and $4 million
in both 2000 and 1999. 
Note 18 - Shareholders' Rights Plan
In July 1998, our Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of
one right for each share of Common Stock outstanding as of August 3, 1998 the Record
Date. Each right initially entitles the registered holder to purchase a unit consisting
of one one-thousandth of a share a Unit of Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock, without par value, at a purchase price of $130 per Unit, subject to adjustment.
The rights, which do not have voting rights, will become exercisable for our Common Stock
ten business days following a public announcement that a person or group has acquired, or
has commenced or intends to commence a tender offer for, 15% or more, or 20% or more if
such person or group owned 10% or more on the adoption date of this plan, of our Common
Stock. In the event the rights become exercisable for Common Stock, each right will
entitle its holder other than the Acquiring Person as defined in the Agreement to
purchase, at the right then-current exercise price, TRICON Common Stock having a value
of twice the exercise price of the right. In the event the rights become exercisable for
Common Stock and thereafter we are acquired in a merger or other business combination,
each right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the right then-current exercise
price, common stock of the acquiring company having a value of twice the exercise price
of the right. 
We can redeem the rights in their entirety, prior to becoming
exercisable, at $001 per right under certain specified conditions. The rights expire on
July 21, 2008, unless we extend that date or we have earlier redeemed or exchanged the
rights as provided in the Agreement. 
This description of the rights is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the Rights Agreement between TRICON and BankBoston, N.A., as Rights Agent, dated as of
July 21, 1998 including the exhibits thereto. 
Note 19 - Share Repurchase Program
In February 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase
program. This program authorizes us to repurchase, through February 14, 2003, up to $300
million excluding applicable transaction fees of our outstanding Common Stock. During
2001, we repurchased approximately 24 million shares for approximately $100 million at
an average price per share of approximately $42. Based on market conditions and other
factors, additional repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or
through privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of the Company. 
In 1999, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $350
million excluding applicable transaction fees, of our outstanding Common Stock. This
share repurchase program was completed in the second quarter of 2000. During 2000, we
repurchased approximately 64 million shares for $216 million at an average price per
share of $34. During 1999, we repurchased over 33 million shares for approximately $134
million at an average price of $40 per share. 64 Note 20 - Income Taxes
The details of our income tax provision benefit are set forth below: 
2001     2000     1999

Taxes payable were reduced by $13 million, $5 million and $14 million in
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, as a result of stock option exercises. In addition,
goodwill and other intangibles were reduced by $8 million and $2 million in 2001 and
2000, respectively, as a result of the settlement of a disputed claim with the Internal
Revenue Service relating to the deductibility of reacquired franchise rights and other
intangibles. These reductions were offset by reductions in deferred and accrued taxes
payable. 
In 2001, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in certain
states and foreign countries were reduced by $9 million $6 million, net of federal tax
and $6 million, respectively, as a result of making a determination that it is more
likely than not that these assets will be utilized in the current and future years. In
2000, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in certain states and foreign
countries were reduced by $35 million $23 million, net of federal tax and $6 million,
respectively, as a result of making a determination that it is more likely than not that
these assets will be utilized in the current and future years. In 1999, valuation
allowances related to deferred tax assets in certain foreign countries were reduced by
$13 million for the same reason. 
The deferred foreign tax provision for 2001 included a $2 million charge
to reflect the impact of changes in statutory tax rates in various countries. The impact
of statutory rate changes in foreign countries was less than $1 million in 2000. The 1999
deferred foreign provision included a benefit of $1 million.

Our valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets decreased by $2
million in 2001 primarily due to the previously discussed change in circumstances,
partially offset by increases in valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in
certain foreign countries and states. 
A determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary
differences related to our investments in foreign subsidiaries and investments in foreign
unconsolidated affiliates that are essentially permanent in duration is not practicable. 
We have available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards
totaling approximately $11 billion at December 29, 2001 to reduce future tax of TRICON
and certain subsidiaries. The carryforwards are related to a number of foreign and state
jurisdictions. Of these carryforwards, $15 million expire in 2002 and $910 million expire
at various times between 2003 and 2020. The remaining carryforwards of approximately $150
million do not expire. 66 Note 21 - Reportable Operating Segments
We are engaged principally in developing, operating, franchising and
licensing the worldwide KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell concepts. KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco
Bell operate throughout the U.S. and in 84, 86 and 13 countries and territories outside
the U.S., respectively. Our five largest international markets based on operating profit
in 2001 are Australia, Canada, China, Korea and the United Kingdom. At December 29, 2001,
we had investments in 10 unconsolidated affiliates outside the U.S. which operate KFC
and/or Pizza Hut restaurants. These unconsolidated affiliates operate in Canada, China,
Japan, Poland and the United Kingdom. 
We identify our operating segments based on management responsibility
within the U.S. and International. For purposes of applying SFAS No. 131 Disclosure
About Segments of An Enterprise and Related Information we consider our three U.S.
Concept operating segments to be similar and therefore have aggregated them into a single
reportable operating segment. Other than the U.S., no individual country represented 10%
or more of our total revenues, operating profit or assets.                               Revenues

Note 22 - Commitments and Contingencies
AmeriServe Bankruptcy Reorganization Process
We and our franchisees and licensees are dependent on frequent
replenishment of the food ingredients and paper supplies required by our restaurants. We
and a large number of our franchisees and licensees operated under multi-year contracts,
which were assumed by McLane Company, Inc. McLane, that had required the use of
AmeriServe to purchase and make deliveries of most of these supplies. AmeriServe filed
for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on January 31, 2000. A plan
of reorganization for AmeriServe the POR was approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court on
November 28, 2000. 
During the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process, we took a number
of actions to ensure continued supply to our system. These actions, resulted in a total
expense of $170 million which was recorded as unusual items in 2000. These costs included
the net funding of $70 million under a debtor-in possession revolving credit facility 59 million of net charges related to the global settlement with holders of allowed
secured and administrative priority claims in the bankruptcy and other costs of $41
million. The other costs included allowances for estimated uncollectible receivables
arising from supply sales to our franchisees and licensees under a temporary program. The
costs also included incremental interest expenses arising from the additional debt
required to finance inventory purchases and the receivables arising from these supply
sales. In 2001, we recorded unusual items income of $21 million related to net recoveries
of residual assets and certain preference claims under the POR. We will record additional
recoveries, if any, as unusual items as they are realized. 68 Other Commitments and Contingencies
Contingent Liabilities 
We were directly or indirectly contingently liable in the amounts of $353
million and $401 million at year-end 2001 and 2000, respectively, for certain lease
assignments and guarantees. At December 29, 2001, $293 million represented contingent
liabilities to lessors as a result of assigning our interest in and obligations under
real estate leases as a condition to the refranchising of certain Company restaurants,
the contribution of certain Company restaurants to unconsolidated affiliates and
guarantees of certain other leases. The $293 million represented the present value of the
minimum payments of the assigned leases, excluding any renewal option periods, discounted
at our pre-tax cost of debt. On a nominal basis, the contingent liability resulting from
the assigned leases is $435 million. 
The contingent liabilities also include guarantees of approximately $324
million to support financial arrangements of certain franchisees, including partial
guarantees of franchisee loan pools originated primarily in connection with the Company
refranchising programs. The total loans outstanding under these loan pools were
approximately $180 million at December 29, 2001. In support of these guarantees, we have
posted $324 million of letters of credit. Also, TRICON provides a standby letter of
credit under which TRICON could potentially be required to fund a portion up to $25
million of one of the franchisee loan pools. Any such funding under the standby letter
of credit would be secured by franchisee loan collateral. We believe that we have
appropriately provided for our estimated probable exposures under these contingent
liabilities. These provisions were primarily charged to refranchising gains losses. 
The remaining contingent liabilities of $28 million primarily related to
our guarantees of financial arrangements of certain unconsolidated affiliates and third
parties. These financial arrangements primarily include lines of credit, loans and
letters of credit. If all lines of credit and letters of credit were fully drawn down,
the maximum contingent liability under these arrangements would be approximately $56
million as of December 29, 2001. 
Insurance Programs 
We are currently self-insured for a portion of our current and prior
years' losses related to workers' compensation, general liability and automobile
liability insurance programs collectively, casualty losses as well as property
losses and certain other insurable risks. To mitigate the cost of our exposures for
certain property and casualty losses, we make annual decisions to either retain the risks
of loss up to certain maximum per occurrence or aggregate loss limits negotiated with our
insurance carriers or to fully insure those risks. Since the Spin-off, we have elected to
retain the risks subject to certain insured limitations. Effective August 16, 1999, we
made changes to our U.S. and portions of our International property and casualty
insurance programs. For fiscal years 2001, 2000 and the period from August 16, 1999
through the end of fiscal year 1999, we have bundled our risks for casualty losses,
property losses and various other insurable risks into one pool with a single
self-insured retention and have purchased reinsurance coverage up to a specified limit
which is significantly above our actuarially determined probable losses. We are
self-insured for losses in excess of the reinsurance limit. We believe the likelihood of
losses exceeding the reinsurance limit is remote. We are also self-insured for healthcare
claims for eligible participating employees subject to certain deductibles and
limitations. We have accounted for our retained liabilities for property and casualty
losses and healthcare claims, including reported and incurred but not reported claims,
based on information provided by our independent actuaries. 
Due to the inherent volatility of our property and actuarially determined
casualty loss estimates, it is reasonably possible that we could experience changes in
estimated losses which could be material to our growth in quarterly and annual net
income. We believe that we have recorded our reserves for property and casualty losses at
a level which has substantially mitigated the potential negative impact of adverse
developments and/or volatility. 69 Change of Control Severance Agreements 
In September 2000, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
approved renewing severance agreements with certain key executives the Agreements
that were set to expire on December 31, 2000. These Agreements are triggered by a
termination, under certain conditions, of the executive employment following a change
in control of the Company, as defined in the Agreements. If triggered, the affected
executives would generally receive twice the amount of both their annual base salary and
their annual incentive in a lump sum, outplacement services and a tax gross-up for any
excise taxes. These Agreements have a three-year term and automatically renew each
January 1 for another three-year term unless the Company elects not to renew the
Agreements. Since the timing of any payments under these Agreements cannot be
anticipated, the amounts are not estimable. However, these payments, if made, could be
substantial. In the event of a change of control, rabbi trusts would be established and
used to provide payouts under existing deferred and incentive compensation plans. 
Wage and Hour Litigation 
We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits,
taxes, environmental and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. Like
certain other large retail employers, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell have been faced in certain
states with allegations of purported class-wide wage and hour violations. 
On August 29, 1997, a class action lawsuit against Taco Bell Corp.,
entitled Bravo, et al. v. Taco Bell Corp.Bravo, was filed in the Circuit Court
of the State of Oregon of the County of Multnomah. The lawsuit was filed by two former
Taco Bell shift managers purporting to represent approximately 17,000 current and former
hourly employees statewide. The lawsuit alleges violations of state wage and hour laws,
principally involving unpaid wages including overtime, and rest and meal period
violations, and seeks an unspecified amount in damages. Under Oregon class action
procedures, Taco Bell was allowed an opportunity to cure the unpaid wage and hour
allegations by opening a claims process to all putative class members prior to
certification of the class. In this cure process, Taco Bell has paid out less than $1
million. On January 26, 1999, the Court certified a class of all current and former shift
managers and crew members who claim one or more of the alleged violations. A trial date
of November 2, 1999 was set. However, on November 1, 1999, the Court issued a proposed
order postponing the trial and establishing a pre-trial claims process. The final order
regarding the claims process was entered on January 14, 2000. Taco Bell moved for
certification of an immediate appeal of the Court-ordered claims process and requested a
stay of the proceedings. This motion was denied on February 8, 2000. Taco Bell appealed
this decision to the Supreme Court of Oregon and the Court denied Taco Bell Writ of
Mandamus on March 21, 2000. A Court-approved notice and claim form was mailed to
approximately 14,500 class members on January 31, 2000. The Court ordered pre-trial
claims process went forward, and hearings to determine potential damages were held for
claimants employed or previously employed in four selected Taco Bell units. After the
initial hearings relating to these four units, the damage claims hearings were
discontinued. Trial began on January 4, 2001. On March 9, 2001, the jury reached verdicts
on the substantive issues in this matter. A number of these verdicts were in favor of the
Taco Bell position; however, certain issues were decided in favor of the plaintiffs. The
Court reduced the number of potential claimants to 1,100. A jury trial to determine the
damages of 93 of those claimants began on February 25, 2002, and is expected to last six
to eight weeks. 
We have provided for the estimated costs of the Bravo litigation, based
on a projection of eligible claims including claims filed to date, where applicable,
the cost of each eligible claim, the estimated legal fees incurred by plaintiffs and the
results of settlement negotiations in this and other wage and hour litigation matters.
Although the outcome of this case cannot be determined at this time, we believe the
ultimate cost of this case in excess of the amounts already provided will not be material
to our annual results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Any provisions
have been recorded as unusual items. 70 On May 11, 1998, a purported class action lawsuit against Pizza Hut,
Inc., and one of its franchisees, PacPizza, LLC, entitled Aguardo, et al. v. Pizza Hut,
Inc., et al., Aguardo, was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California of
the County of San Francisco. The lawsuit was filed by three former Pizza Hut restaurant
general managers purporting to represent approximately 1,300 current and former
California restaurant general managers of Pizza Hut and PacPizza, LLC. The lawsuit
alleged violations of state wage and hour laws involving unpaid overtime wages and
vacation pay and sought an unspecified amount in damages. On January 12, 2000, the Court
certified a class of approximately 1,300 current and former restaurant general managers.
The Court amended the class on June 1, 2000 to include approximately 150 additional
current and former restaurant general managers. On May 2, 2001, the parties reached an
agreement to settle this matter and entered into a stipulation of discontinuance of the
case. The Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on September 27, 2001, and
final approval of the settlement on December 20, 2001. As no objections to the settlement
were made, the Court order approving the settlement and dismissing with prejudice all
claims is final and non-appealable. We have provided for the costs of this settlement as
unusual items. 
On October 2, 1996, a class action lawsuit against Taco Bell Corp.,
entitled Mynaf, et al. v. Taco Bell Corp., was filed in the Superior Court of the State
of California of the County of Santa Clara. The lawsuit was filed by two former
restaurant general managers and two former assistant restaurant general managers
purporting to represent all current and former Taco Bell restaurant general managers and
assistant restaurant general managers in California. The lawsuit alleged violations of
California wage and hour laws involving unpaid overtime wages and violations of the State
Labor Code record-keeping requirements. The complaint also included an unfair business
practices claim. Plaintiffs claimed individual damages ranging from $10,000 to $100,000
each. On September 17, 1998, the court certified a class of approximately 3,000 current
and former assistant restaurant general managers and restaurant general managers. Taco
Bell petitioned the appellate court to review the trial court certification order. The
petition was denied on December 31, 1998. Taco Bell then filed a petition for review with
the California Supreme Court, and the petition was subsequently denied. Class notices
were mailed on August 31, 1999 to over 3,400 class members. Trial began on January 29,
2001. Before conclusion of the trial, the parties reached an agreement to settle this
matter, and entered into a stipulation of discontinuance of the case. This settlement
agreement was approved by the court on September 21, 2001. We have provided for the costs
of this settlement as unusual items. 
Other Litigation 
On January 16, 1998, a lawsuit against Taco Bell Corp., entitled Wrench
LLC, Joseph Shields and Thomas Rinks v. Taco Bell Corp. Wrench was filed in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan. The lawsuit alleges
that Taco Bell Corp. misappropriated certain ideas and concepts used in its advertising
featuring a Chihuahua. Plaintiffs seek to recover damages under several theories,
including breach of implied-in-fact contract, idea misappropriation, conversion and
unfair competition. On June 10, 1999, the District Court granted summary judgment in
favor of Taco Bell Corp. Plaintiffs filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit the Court of Appeals, and oral arguments were held on September 20,
2000. On July 6, 2001, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court judgment in
favor of Taco Bell Corp. and remanded the case to the District Court. Taco Bell Corp.
unsuccessfully petitioned the Court of Appeals for rehearing en banc, and its petition
for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied on January 21, 2002.
The case has now officially been returned to the District Court, where the Wrench
plaintiffs will be allowed to bring their claims to trial. 
We believe that the Wrench plaintiffs' claims are without merit and are
vigorously defending the case. However, in view of the inherent uncertainties of
litigation, the outcome of the case cannot be predicted at this time. Likewise, the
amount of any potential loss cannot be reasonably estimated. 71 CF Packing Co., Inc. v. Pizza Hut, Inc. This action was originally filed in 1993 by CF Packing Co., Inc., a Chicago meat packing
company CF, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. This lawsuit alleges that Pizza Hut
misappropriated various trade secrets relating to CF alleged process for manufacturing a precooked Italian sausage pizza topping.
CF trade secret claims against Pizza Hut were originally dismissed by the trial court on statute of limitations grounds. That
ruling was later overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in August 2000 and the case was remanded to the
trial court for further proceedings. On remand, Pizza Hut moved for summary judgment on its statute of limitations defense. That
motion was denied in January 2001. This lawsuit was scheduled for trial in late January 2002. Prior to trial, the parties entered
into a written settlement agreement pursuant to which CF agreed to dismiss the case in exchange for a lump sum payment from Pizza
Hut. This payment has been made and the case was dismissed with prejudice effective February 6, 2002. We have provided for the
costs of this settlement as unusual items in 2001.
Obligations to PepsiCo, Inc. After Spin-off 
In connection with the Spin-off, we entered into separation and other
related agreements the Separation Agreements, governing the Spin-off transaction and
our subsequent relationship with PepsiCo. These agreements provide certain indemnities to
PepsiCo. 
The Separation Agreements provided for, among other things, our
assumption of all liabilities relating to the restaurant businesses, including California
Pizza Kitchen, Chevys Mexican Restaurant, D'Angelo Sandwich Shops, East Side Mario
and Hot 'n Now collectively the Non-core Businesses, and our indemnification of
PepsiCo with respect to these liabilities. We have included our best estimates of these
liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In addition, we have indemnified PepsiCo for any costs or losses it
incurs with respect to all letters of credit, guarantees and contingent liabilities
relating to our businesses under which PepsiCo remains liable. As of December 29, 2001,
PepsiCo remains liable for approximately $94 million on a nominal basis related to these
contingencies. This obligation ends at the time PepsiCo is released, terminated or
replaced by a qualified letter of credit. We have not been required to make any payments
under this indemnity. 
Under the Separation Agreements, PepsiCo maintains full control and
absolute discretion with regard to any combined or consolidated tax filings for periods
through October 6, 1997. PepsiCo also maintains full control and absolute discretion
regarding any common tax audit issues. Although PepsiCo has contractually agreed to, in
good faith, use its best efforts to settle all joint interests in any common audit issue
on a basis consistent with prior practice, there can be no assurance that determinations
made by PepsiCo would be the same as we would reach, acting on our own behalf. Through
December 29, 2001, there have not been any determinations made by PepsiCo where we would
have reached a different determination. 
We also agreed to certain restrictions on our actions to help ensure that
the Spin-off maintained its tax-free status. These restrictions, which were generally
applicable to the two-year period following October 6, 1997, included among other things,
limitations on any liquidation, merger or consolidation with another company, certain
issuances and redemptions of our Common Stock, our granting of stock options and our
sale, refranchising, distribution or other disposition of assets. If we failed to abide
by these restrictions or to obtain waivers from PepsiCo and, as a result, the Spin-off
fails to qualify as a tax-free reorganization, we may be obligated to indemnify PepsiCo
for any resulting tax liability, which could be substantial. No payments under these
indemnities have been required or are expected to be required. Additionally, PepsiCo is
entitled to the federal income tax benefits related to the exercise after the Spin-off of
vested PepsiCo options held by our employees. We expense the payroll taxes related to the
exercise of these options as incurred. 72 Note 23 - Selected Quarterly Financial Data Unaudited                                2001

We are responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation
of the Consolidated Financial Statements, related notes and other information included in
this annual report. The financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include certain amounts
based upon our estimates and assumptions, as required. Other financial information
presented in the annual report is derived from the financial statements. 
We maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting,
designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the financial
statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. The
system is supported by formal policies and procedures, including an active Code of
Conduct program intended to ensure employees adhere to the highest standards of personal
and professional integrity. Our internal audit function monitors and reports on the
adequacy of and compliance with the internal control system, and appropriate actions are
taken to address significant control deficiencies and other opportunities for improving
the system as they are identified. 
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been audited and reported on
by our independent auditors, KPMG LLP, who were given free access to all financial
records and related data, including minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors and
Committees of the Board. We believe that management representations made to the
independent auditors were valid and appropriate. 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely
of outside directors, provides oversight to our financial reporting process and our
controls to safeguard assets through periodic meetings with our independent auditors,
internal auditors and management. Both our independent auditors and internal auditors
have free access to the Audit Committee. 
Although no cost-effective internal control system will preclude all
errors and irregularities, we believe our controls as of December 29, 2001 provide
reasonable assurance that our assets are reasonably safeguarded. David J. Deno
Chief Financial Officer 74 Report of Independent Auditors The Board of Directors
TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc.: 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TRICON
Global Restaurants, Inc. and Subsidiaries TRICON as of December 29, 2001 and December
30, 2000, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and shareholders'
equity deficit and comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 29, 2001. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
of TRICON management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TRICON as of December
29, 2001 and December 30, 2000, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 29, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. s/ KPMG LLP
