NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Intevac, Inc. and its subsidiaries Intevac or the Company after elimination of
inter-company balances and transactions. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those
estimates. Change in Fiscal Year End Date 
On February19, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the Companys change to a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the
Saturday nearest to December31 of each year in order to improve the alignment of financial and business processes and to streamline financial reporting. Each fiscal quarter consists of 13 weeks, with an occasional fourth quarter extending to
14 weeks, if necessary, for the fiscal year to end on the Saturday nearest to December31. The Companys fiscal 2015 year ended on January2, 2016. The Companys fiscal 2014 year ended on January3, 2015. 
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments 
Intevac considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
Available-for-sale securities, comprised of commercial paper, obligations of the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate debt securities and municipal bonds, are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded within other
comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary, if any, on available-for-sale securities are included in earnings. Purchases and
sales of investment securities are recognized on a trade date basis. The cost of investment securities sold is determined by the specific identification method. 
Restricted Cash 
Restricted cash of $10 million as of January2, 2016 secures a standby letter of credit obligation associated with a lease obligation and
the restriction on the cash will be removed when the letter of credit expires. In addition Intevac pledged $780,000 as collateral for a bankers guarantee on an advance payment made by a customer. 
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Arrangements 
Foreign Exchange Exposure ManagementIntevac enters into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and
losses generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a non-functional currency and to offset certain operational exposures from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from the
portion of the Companys operations, assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Singapore dollar. These foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into to support transactions made
in the normal course of business, and accordingly, are not speculative in nature. The contracts are for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying transactions, generally one year or less. Changes in the fair value of these undesignated
hedges are recognized in other income expense, net immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the asset or liability being hedged. 
48 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Fair Value MeasurementDefinition and Hierarchy 
Intevac reports certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Intevac defines fair value as the price that would be received from
selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements
are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities. Level 2Valuations based on other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities,
quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
Level 3Valuations based on inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimates of assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Trade Accounts and Notes Receivables and Doubtful Accounts 
Intevac evaluates the collectibility of trade accounts receivable and notes receivable on an ongoing basis and provides reserves against
potential losses when appropriate. Management analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, changes in customer payment tendencies and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for
doubtful accounts. Customer accounts are written off against the allowance when the amount is deemed uncollectible. Also, accounts determined to be uncollectible are put in nonaccrual status whereby interest is not accrued on those accounts. 
Inventories 
Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on an average cost basis. 
Property, Plant and Equipment 
Equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets as follows: computers and software, 3 years; machinery and equipment, 5 years; furniture, 7 years; vehicles, 4 years; and leasehold improvements, remaining lease term. 
Contingent Consideration and Purchased Intangible Assets 
Contingent consideration related to a business combination is recorded at the acquisition date at the estimated fair value of the contingent
payments. The acquisition date fair value is measured based on the consideration expected to be transferred probability-weighted, discounted back to present value. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance
with accepted valuation methods. The fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration is remeasured at the estimated fair value at each reporting period with the change in fair value recognized as income or expense in the consolidated
statements of operations Purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are
determined to be indefinite. Purchased intangible assets are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally one to thirteen years using the straight line
method. In 2012, as a result of its impairment analysis, Intevac wrote off all of the goodwill in both its Thin-film Equipment and Photonics reporting units. 
49 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
Long-lived assets and certain identifiable finite-lived intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and
its eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset. When an impairment loss is recognized, the
carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value. No impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013. 
Income Taxes 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases
of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
On a quarterly basis, Intevac provides for income taxes based upon an annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly
dependent upon the level of Intevacs projected earnings, the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, net operating loss carryforwards, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of
Intevacs tax planning strategies. Intevac carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjust its effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from the estimates, this could have a material effect on
Intevacs business, financial condition and results of operations. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment
in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with Intevacs expectations could have a material effect on Intevacs business, financial
condition and results of operations. Intevac recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the
provision for income taxes. Sales and Value Added Taxes 
Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations. Revenue Recognition 
Intevac recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title and risk of loss have passed to
Intevacs customer or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Intevacs shipping terms are customarily FOB shipping point or equivalent terms. Intevacs revenue
recognition policy generally results in revenue recognition at the following points: 1for all transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon shipment, Intevac recognizes revenue upon shipment for all products that have been
demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment; the portion of revenue associated with certain installation-related tasks is deferred, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation-related tasks; 2for
products that have not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized at customer acceptance; and 3for arrangements containing multiple elements, the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is
deferred until delivery of the deferred elements. When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, Intevac allocates revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on its VSOE if
available, TPE if VSOE is not available, or best ESP if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. 
50 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Intevac generally utilizes the ESP due to the nature of its products. In certain cases, technology upgrade sales are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements, usually split between delivery
of the parts and installation on the customers systems. In these cases, Intevac recognizes revenue for the relative sales price of the parts upon shipment and transfer of title, and recognizes revenue for the relative sales price of
installation services when those services are completed. Revenue related to sales of spare parts is generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services. In addition, Intevac uses
the installment method to record revenue based on cash receipts in situations where the account receivable is collected over an extended period of time and in managements judgment the degree of collectibility is uncertain. 
Intevac performs research and development work under various government-sponsored research contracts. Revenue on cost-plus-fee contracts is
recognized to the extent of costs actually incurred plus a proportionate amount of the fee earned. Intevac considers fixed fees under cost-plus-fee contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs actually incurred in performance of the
contract. Revenue on fixed-price contracts is recognized on a milestone method or percentage-of-completion method of contract accounting. For contracts structured as milestone agreements, revenue is recognized when a specified milestone is achieved,
provided that 1the milestone event is substantive in nature and there is substantial uncertainty about the achievement of the milestone at the inception of the agreement, 2the milestone payment is non-refundable, and 3there
is no continuing performance obligations associated with the milestone payment. Any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria are deferred. Intevac generally determines the percentage completed based on the
percentage of costs incurred to date in relation to total estimated costs expected through completion of the contract. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned, a provision for the
entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period the loss is determined. Advertising Costs 
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs were not material for all periods presented. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
The functional currency of Intevacs foreign subsidiaries in Singapore and Hong Kong and the Taiwan branch is the U.S. dollar. The
functional currency of Intevacs foreign subsidiaries in China, Malaysia and Korea is the local currency of the country in which the respective subsidiary operates. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at
year-end exchange rates; revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. The effect of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The effects of foreign currency transactions are included in other income in the determination of net loss. Net income losses from foreign currency transactions were $80,000 11,000, and $36,000 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Employee Stock Plans 
Intevac has equity-based compensation plans that provide for the grant to employees of equity-based awards, including incentive or
non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units RSUs also referred to as performance units and performance shares. In addition, these plans provide for the grant of non-statutory stock
options and RSUs to non-employee directors and consultants. Intevac also has an employee stock purchase plan, which provides Intevacs employees with the opportunity to purchase Intevac common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. See
Note 2 for a complete description of these plans and their accounting treatment. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued an update to Accounting Standards Codification
ASC 740, Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This update simplifies the presentation of current and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities and assets. Under this update, the deferred tax liabilities and assets
are classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The update does not impact the current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets be offset and presented as a single amount. Intevac early adopted this update prospectively in fiscal
2015. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2015, the FASB
issued an update to ASC 805, Business Combinations: Simplifying the Accounting Measurement-Period Adjustments. This update simplifies the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination by eliminating the
requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. Under this update, the adjustments are recognized in the reporting period in which 
52 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
the adjustment amounts are determined. This update is effective for Intevac in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and should be applied prospectively. Intevac does not expect the adoption of this
update to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In July 2015, the FASB issued an update to ASC 330, Inventory:
Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. Under this update, subsequent measurement of inventory is based on the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the
estimated cost of completion and disposal. This update should be applied prospectively and will be adopted by Intevac in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Early adoption is permitted. Intevac does not expect the adoption of this update to have a
material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued an update to ASC 350, IntangiblesGoodwill
and OtherInternal-Use Software: Customers Accounting for Fees Paid in Cloud Computing Arrangement. This update provides guidance on the accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement if the arrangement was determined to
include a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the software license element of the arrangement should be accounted for as an acquisition of a software license. If the arrangement does not contain a
software license, it should be accounted for as a service contract. This update will be effective for Intevac in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and may be adopted either retrospectively or prospectively. Intevac does not expect the adoption of
this update to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued an update to ASC 606 Revenue
from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 that will supersede virtually all existing revenue guidance. This update affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts
for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. The standards core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under todays guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating
the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. This update to ASC 606 should be applied retrospectively either to each prior reporting period
presented in the financial statements, or only to the most current reporting period presented in the financial statements with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded in the retained earnings. In August 2015, the FASB issued an update to defer the
effective date of this update by one year. This update becomes effective and will be adopted by Intevac in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Early adoption is not permitted for reporting periods before the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements. 
2. Equity-Based Compensation 
Intevac accounts for share-based awards in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance which requires the
measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees, consultants and directors based upon the grant-date fair value of those awards. The estimated fair value of Intevacs equity-based awards,
less expected forfeitures, is amortized over the awards service periods using the graded vesting attribution method.

Descriptions of Plans 
Equity Incentive Plans At
January2, 2016, Intevac had equity-based awards outstanding under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan the Plans and the 2003 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP. Intevacs
stockholders approved all of these plans. The Plans are a broad-based, long-term retention program intended to attract and retain
qualified management and employees, and align stockholder and employee interests. The Plans permit the grant of incentive or non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, RSUs and performance shares. Option price, vesting
period, and other terms are determined by the administrator of the Plans, but the option price shall generally not be less than 100% of the fair market value per share on the date of grant. As of January2, 2016, 44million shares of
common stock were authorized for future issuance under the Plans. The 2012 Plan expires no later than May8, 2022. 2003 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan In 2003, Intevacs stockholders approved adoption of the ESPP, which serves as the successor to the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan originally adopted in 1995. Upon adoption of the ESPP, all shares available for issuance under the prior plan were transferred to the ESPP. The ESPP provides that eligible employees may purchase Intevac common stock through
payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning of the applicable offering period or at the end of each applicable purchase interval. Offering periods are generally two years in length, and consist
of a series of six-month purchase intervals. Eligible employees may join the ESPP at the beginning of any six-month purchase interval. Under the terms of the ESPP, employees can choose to have up to 15% of their base earnings withheld to purchase
Intevac common stock. As of January2, 2016, 326,000 shares remained available for issuance under the ESPP. The effect of recording
equity-based compensation for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was as follows in thousands:  2015 2014 2013 Equity-based compensation by type of award Stock options 963 1,094 984 RSUs 1,711 1,464 419 Employee stock purchase plan 946 442 1,091

Stock Options 
The exercise price of each stock option equals the market price of Intevacs stock on the date of grant. Most options are scheduled to
vest over three and/or four years and expire no later than ten years after the grant date. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model was developed for use in
estimating the value of publicly traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Intevacs employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of publicly traded options. The weighted
average assumptions used in the model are outlined in the following table:  2015 2014 2013 Stock Options Weighted-average fair value of grants per share 205 315 249 Expected volatility 4612 5212 5628 Risk free interest rate 142 139 109 Expected term of options in years 399 438 420 Dividend yield None None None
The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes calculations for new grants is
based on historical volatility of Intevacs stock price. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasury Strips with an equivalent remaining term. The expected life of employee stock options represents the
weighted-average period that the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and was determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards and vesting schedules. The
dividend yield assumption is based on Intevacs history of not paying dividends and the assumption of not paying dividends in the future. 
A summary of the stock option activity is as follows:  Shares WeightedAverageExercisePrice  AggregateIntrinsicValue Options outstanding at January3, 2015 2,584,935 826 415 1,895,817 Options granted 447,625 551 Options cancelled and forfeited 544,423 967 Options exercised 54,490 440

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $65,000, $496,000
and $49,000, respectively. At January2, 2016, Intevac had $900,000 of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock option plans that will be recognized over the weighted average period of 115 years.

Stock Option Exchange Program 
During our Annual Stockholders Meeting held on May9, 2013, our stockholders approved a one-time Employee Stock Option Exchange
Program the Exchange Program pursuant to which eligible employees were provided an opportunity to exchange, on a grant-by-grant basis, eligible outstanding stock options for a lesser number of new options, to be granted under our 2012
Equity Incentive Plan. Options eligible for the Exchange Program are those that were granted prior to the 12-month period preceding the start of the Exchange Program offering period, and have exercise prices per share that are greater than $849,
50% above our closing per share stock price measured as of July5, 2013 which is shortly before the start of the Exchange Program. The Exchange Program offering period commenced on July6, 2013 and closed on August6, 2013, at which
time a total of 87 eligible option holder participants exchanged 766,000 outstanding stock options for 336,000 stock options. The
Exchange Program was launched to restore the intended retention and incentive value of employee equity awards, reduce the potential dilutive effect of our equity incentive program, and reduce pressure to grant additional equity awards to employees
in the short term. Participation in the Exchange Program was made available to all employees in the United States and Singapore except for the Named Executive Officers. Non-employee members of our Board of Directors were also not eligible to
participate. The exchange of options under the Exchange Program resulted in a total incremental charge to compensation expense of $126,000. This incremental charge is being recognized over the vesting periods of the new options. These vesting
periods range from one to three years beginning on the first anniversary of the grant. RSUs

56 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
RSUs are converted into shares of Intevac common stock upon vesting on a one-for-one basis.
RSUs typically are scheduled to vest over three and/or four years. Vesting of RSUs is subject to the grantees continued service with Intevac. The compensation expense related to these awards is determined using the fair market value of Intevac
common stock on the date of the grant, and the compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period. At January2, 2016, Intevac had $991,000 of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to RSUs that
will be recognized over the weighted average period of 102 years. The annual bonus for participants in the Companys annual
incentive plan for fiscal 2015 will be settled with RSUs with one year vesting issued in 2016. The Company accrued for the payment of bonuses at the expected company-wide payout percentage amount at January2, 2016, which amounts were less than
the target bonus amounts for each participant. The bonus accrual is classified as a liability until the number of shares is determined on the date the awards are granted, at which time the Company classifies the awards into equity. The Company
recorded equity-based compensation expense related to the annual incentive plan of $324,000 in fiscal 2015. At January2, 2016, Intevac had $560,000 of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to the annual
incentive plan that will be recognized over the weighted average period of 069 years. The annual bonus for participants in the
Companys annual incentive plan for fiscal 2014 was settled with RSUs with one year vesting issued in 2015. The Company recorded equity-based compensation expense related to the annual incentive plan of $554,000 in fiscal 2014. In February
2015, the annual bonus for certain participants was settled with RSUs with one year vesting. Twenty-nine participants were granted stock awards to receive 133,000 shares of common stock with a weighted average grant date fair value of $685 per
share. Performance-based RSUs performance-based awards granted in fiscal 2013 to certain executive officers are also
subject to the achievement of specified performance goals. These performance-based awards become eligible to vest only if performance goals are achieved and then actually will vest only if the grantee remains employed by Intevac through each
applicable vesting date. The fair value of these performance-based awards is estimated on the date of grant and assumes that the specified performance goals will be achieved. If the goals are achieved, these awards vest over a specified remaining
service period, provided that the grantee remains employed by Intevac through each scheduled vesting date. If the performance goals are not met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed.
The expected cost of each award is reflected over the service period and is reduced for estimated forfeitures. For performance-based awards granted during fiscal 2013, the performance goals require the achievement of targeted revenues and adjusted
annual operating profit levels measured at the end of two and three-year periods. In early 2015, the Compensation Committee assessed performance against the goals following the completion of the 2-year performance period for Tranche 1 and determined
that 5,532 shares of the awards became earned and therefore eligible for time-based vesting. In early 2016, the Compensation Committee assessed performance against the goals following the completion of the 3-year performance period for Tranche 2 and
determined that 4,920 shares of the awards became earned and therefore eligible for time-based vesting.

forfeitures related to purchase rights that will be recognized over the weighted average period of 070 years. 
3. Earnings Per Share 
Intevac calculates basic earnings per share EPS using net income loss and the weighted-average number of
shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS includes the effect from potential issuance of common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options and vesting of RSUs. 
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted loss per share: 2015 2014 2013  Net loss 9,166 27,445 15,696

Weighted-average shares diluted 22,218 23,671 23,832 
Net loss per share basic and diluted 041 116 066 
As the Company is in a net loss position, all of the Companys equity instruments are considered
antidilutive.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  4. Concentrations 
Credit Risk and Significant Customers 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash equivalents, short- and
long-term investments, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. Intevac generally invests its excess cash in money market funds, commercial paper, obligations of the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate debt securities and municipal bonds.
The Company has adopted an investment policy and established guidelines relating to credit quality, diversification and maturities of its investments in order to preserve principal and maintain liquidity. All investment securities in Intevacs
portfolio have an investment grade credit rating. Intevacs accounts receivable tend to be concentrated in a limited number of
customers. The following customers accounted for at least 10 percent of Intevacs accounts receivable at January2, 2016 and January3,2015.  2015 2014 HGST 37 Western Digital 15 U.S. Government 11 13 Seagate Technology 46  Less than 10% Intevacs largest customers tend to change from period to period.
Historically, a significant portion of Intevacs revenues in any particular period have been attributable to sales to a limited number of customers. Intevac performs credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally
requires deposits on system orders but does not generally require collateral or other security to support customer receivables. The
following customers accounted for at least 10 percent of Intevacs consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014, and/or 2013.  2015 2014 2013 U.S. Government 26 32 Seagate Technology 22 15 37 HGST 15 17 Northrop Grumman 11  Less than 10% Products 
Disk manufacturing products contributed a significant portion of Intevacs revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013. Intevac expects that
the ability to maintain or expand its current levels of revenues in the future will depend upon continuing market demand for its products; its success in enhancing its existing systems and developing and manufacturing competitive disk manufacturing
equipment, such as the 200 Lean; its success in utilizing Intevacs expertise in complex manufacturing equipment to develop and sell new equipment products for PV and DCP manufacturing and Intevacs success in developing military products
based on its low-light technology.

7. Contingent Consideration 
In connection with the acquisition of SIT, Intevac agreed to pay up to an aggregate of $70 million in cash to the selling
shareholders if certain milestones were achieved over a specified period. Intevac has made payments to the selling shareholders for achievement of the first milestone in 2011, and for achievement of the second and third milestones in 2012. The
fourth and final milestone was not achieved on the targeted date outlined in the acquisition agreement and will not be paid. There is no remaining contingent consideration obligation associated with the milestone agreement at January2, 2016.
In connection with the acquisition of SIT, Intevac also agreed to pay to the selling shareholders in cash a revenue earnout on
Intevacs net revenue from commercial sales of certain products over a specified period up to an aggregate of $90 million. Intevac estimated the fair value of this contingent consideration on January2, 2016 based on probability-based
forecasted revenues reflecting Intevacs own assumptions concerning future revenue from such products. As of January2, 2016, payments made associated with the revenue earnout obligation have not been significant. 
The fair value measurement of contingent consideration is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level
3 measurement. The following table represents the quantitative range of the significant unobservable inputs used in the calculation of fair value of the contingent consideration liability as of January2, 2016. Significant increases or
decreases in any of these inputs even in isolation would result in a significantly lower higher fair value measurement.   FairValue ValuationTechnique

8. Divestiture 
Sale of DeltaNu 
On March29, 2013, the Company sold certain assets, including existing tangible and intangible assets, which comprised its Raman
spectroscopy instruments product line, also known as DeltaNu, for consideration not to exceed $15 million. Under the terms of the agreement, the acquirer also assumed certain liabilities related to the purchased assets. Payment terms included
$500,000 which was paid on the closing date, with the remaining balance to be paid in the form of an earnout of 5% of the acquirers Raman spectroscopy instrument sales for 5 years following the closing date which will be due and payable on or
before each anniversary of the closing date or a minimum earnout payment of $100,000 annually, whichever is higher. The maximum earnout payments during the payment period shall not exceed $10 million. 
As the earnout is collected over an extended period of time and in managements judgment the degree of collectibility is uncertain,
Intevac did not recognize the minimum earnout payments upon closing, but instead will record income in the period when the minimum earnout payments can be reasonably estimated for that period and payment is assured. The first and second earnout
payments in the amount of $75,000 and $100,000 were received in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 and were reported in other income expense, net on the consolidated statements of operations.

All prices for the fixed maturity securities including U.S. treasury and agency securities, commercial paper,
corporate bonds and municipal bonds are received from independent pricing services utilized by Intevacs outside investment manager. This investment manager performs a review of the pricing methodologies and inputs utilized by the independent
pricing services for each asset type priced by the vendor. In addition, on at least an annual basis, the investment manager conducts due diligence visits and interviews with each pricing vendor to verify the inputs utilized for each asset class. The
due diligence visits include a review of the procedures performed by each vendor to ensure that pricing evaluations are representative of the price that would be received to sell a security in an orderly transaction. Any pricing where the input is
based solely on a broker price is deemed to be a Level 3 price. Intevac uses the pricing data obtained from its outside investment manager as the primary input to make its assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of the
above-mentioned securities and has not made, during the periods presented, any material adjustments to such inputs. The following table

Derivatives 
The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the re-measurement of certain
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and to offset certain operational exposures from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in
interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are largely offset by re-measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Cash flows from such derivatives are
classified as operating activities. The derivatives have maturities of approximately 30, 60, 210 and 240 days. The following table

Stock Repurchase Program 
On November21, 2013, Intevacs Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing up to $300 million in
repurchases. Under this authorization, Intevac purchases shares of its common stock under a systematic stock repurchase program and may also make supplemental stock repurchases from time to time, depending on market conditions, stock price and other
factors. On November12, 2015, Intevac entered into a Share Repurchase Agreement with Northern Right Capital Management, L.P. and
certain of its affiliated funds, including on behalf of a managed account collectively, NRC, whereby Intevac repurchased 1,483,171 shares of its common stock or approximately 68% of the outstanding common stock from NRC in a
privately negotiated transaction at a purchase price of $498 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $74 million. The repurchase was made in conjunction with Intevacs stock repurchase program. 
At January2, 2016, $15 million remains available for future stock repurchases under the repurchase program.

Intevac records treasury stock purchases under the cost method using the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
Upon reissuance of treasury stock, amounts in excess of the acquisition cost are credited to additional paid-in capital. If Intevac reissues treasury stock at an amount below its acquisition cost and additional paid-in capital associated with prior
treasury stock transactions is insufficient to cover the difference between the acquisition cost and the reissue price, this difference is recorded against retained earnings.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes.

Intevac accounts for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards for such taxes, which requires that
deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Accounting standards also require that deferred tax
assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the
existing deferred tax assets. A significant element of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year periods ended January3, 2015,December31, 2013 and December31, 2012. Such
objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as Intevacs projections for future growth. On the basis of this analysis and the significant negative objective evidence, for fiscal 2014, a valuation allowance
of $94 million was added to record only the portion of the Singapore deferred tax asset that more likely than not will be realized. For fiscal 2015, a valuation allowance increase of $631,000 for the Singapore deferred tax asset was recorded. 
68 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
In fiscal 2012, a valuation allowance of $234 million was added to record only the portion
of the U.S. federal deferred tax asset that more likely than not will be realized. For fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, valuation allowance increases of $16 million, $47 million and $72 million, respectively for the U.S. federal deferred tax asset
were recorded. A valuation allowance is recorded against the entire state deferred tax asset which consists of state income tax temporary differences and deferred research and other tax credits that are not realizable in the foreseeable future. 
The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the
carryforward period are reduced or increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth. 
As of January2, 2016, our federal, foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $566
million, $598 million and $620 million, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations under Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state tax laws. If not utilized, the
federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2016. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. As of January2, 2016, our federal
and state tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $123 million and $128 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2019 and the state tax credits carry forward
indefinitely. The difference between the tax provision benefit at the statutory federal income tax rate and the tax provision benefit
for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was as follows in thousands:  2015 2014 2013 Income tax benefit at the federal statutory rate 3,014 6,656 6,096 State income taxes, net of federal benefit 6 5 12 Change in valuation allowance U.S 1,625 4,733 7,201 Foreign 631 9,394 Effect of foreign operations taxed at various rates 140 1,662 983 Research tax credits 931 569 2,284 Effect of tax rate changes, permanent differences and adjustments of prior deferrals 2,114 153 1,062 Unrecognized tax benefits 264 294 476

Intevac has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately
$128million of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations as of January2, 2016 because Intevac intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the United States. If Intevac were to distribute these earnings, foreign tax
credits may become available under current law to reduce the resulting U.S. income tax liability. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable. Intevac will remit the
non-indefinitely reinvested earnings, if any, of Intevacs non-U.S. subsidiaries where excess cash has accumulated and Intevac determines that it is advantageous for business operations, tax or cash reasons. 
Intevac benefitted from tax incentives in Singapore which were scheduled to expire at the end of 2015. These tax incentives provided a lower
income tax rate on certain classes of income so long as certain thresholds 
69 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
of business investment and employment levels were met in Singapore. Intevac was granted an early termination of this tax benefit arrangement effective January1, 2013 by the Singapore tax
authority. The terms of the early termination include meeting certain agreed upon future annual business spending and staffing levels in Singapore. Failure to meet the terms of the early termination could result in a claw back by the Singapore
government of tax benefits received in previous years. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $72 million as of
January2, 2016, of which $354,000 would affect Intevacs effective tax rate if realized. The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013: 2015 2014 2013 in thousands Beginning balance 6,578 6,482 6,000 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 574 57 597 Additions for tax positions of prior years 21 250 98 Settlements Lapse of statute of limitations 211 213 
Ending balance 7,173 6,578 6,482 
The Company does not anticipate any changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve
months. It is Intevacs policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations. During fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, Intevac recognized a net
tax expense benefit for interest of $2,000, $110,000 and $13,000, respectively. As of January2, 2016 Intevac had $10,000 of accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits, which was classified as a long-term liability in the
consolidated balance sheets. Intevac did not accrue any penalties related to these unrecognized tax benefits because Intevac has other tax attributes which would offset any potential taxes due. 
Intevac is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Tax regulations within each
jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. The material jurisdictions where Intevac is subject to potential examination by tax authorities for tax years after
2009 include the U.S. Federal and California and Singapore. The Singapore Inland Revenue Authority is currently conducting a review of the fiscal 2009 through 2012 tax returns of the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary, Intevac Asia Pte. Ltd.
The Singapore Inland Revenue Authority has challenged the Companys tax position with respect to certain aspects of the Companys transfer pricing. Under Singapore tax law, the Company must pay all contested taxes and the related interest
to have the right to defend its position. As a result, the Company made deposits of $318,000 for the 2009 tax year in fiscal 2014 and $11 million for the 2010 tax year in fiscal 2015, respectively. These deposits of $14 million are included in
other long-term assets at January2, 2016. The ultimate outcome of this examination is subject to uncertainty, and the Company has a liability for its uncertain tax position in Singapore as of January2, 2016 of $262,000. The
Companys management and its advisors continue to believe that the Company is more likely than not to successfully defend that the tax treatment was proper and in accordance with Singapore tax regulations. Based on the information
currently available, the Company does not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to its unrecognized tax benefits for this matter within the next twelve months. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may
ultimately result from this or other examinations. Presently, there are no other active income tax examinations in the jurisdictions where Intevac operates. 
70 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  12. Employee Benefit Plans 
Employee Savings and Retirement Plan 
In 1991, Intevac established a defined contribution retirement plan with 401k plan features. The plan covers all United States employees
eighteen years and older. Employees may make contributions by a percentage reduction in their salaries, not to exceed the statutorily prescribed annual limit. Intevac did not make any cash contributions for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. Intevac made
cash contributions of $422,000 for fiscal 2013. Employees may choose among several investment options for their contributions and their share of Intevacs contributions, and they are able to move funds between investment options at any time.
Intevacs common stock is not one of the investment options. Administrative expenses relating to the plan are insignificant. 
Employee Bonus Plans 
Intevac has various employee bonus plans. A profit-sharing plan provides for the distribution of a percentage of pre-tax profits to
substantially all of Intevacs employees not eligible for other performance-based incentive plans, up to a maximum percentage of compensation. Other plans award annual cash bonuses to Intevacs executives and key contributors based on the
achievement of profitability and other specific performance criteria. Charges to expense under these plans were $219,000, $22,000 and $17 million, respectively for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013. In fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, the annual bonus for
certain participants in the Companys annual incentive plan will be settled with RSUs with one year vesting. Charges for bonuses in the amount of $324,000 and $554,000 for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 were reported as stock compensation expense.
In February 2015, the annual bonus for certain participants of the 2014 annual incentive plan was settled with RSUs with one year vesting. Twenty-nine participants were granted stock awards to receive 133,000 shares of common stock with a weighted
average grant date fair value of $685 per share. See Note 2 Equity-Based Compensation. 
13. Commitments and Contingencies 
Leases 
Intevac leases certain facilities under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various times up to March 2024 and has options to renew
most leases, with rentals to be negotiated. Certain of Intevacs leases contain provisions for rental adjustments. Included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets is $12 of deferred rent as of January2, 2016
related to the effective rent on Intevacs long-term lease for Intevacs Santa Clara, California facility. The terms of the Companys lease of its Santa Clara, California facility include a tenant improvement allowance of up to $17
million. Tenant improvement allowances are reimbursements received from the landlord for construction costs and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as a reduction in rent. The tenant improvement allowances are recorded when
the Company has completed its obligations and the tenant improvement allowance is receivable. In addition, Intevac is required to maintain a standby letter of credit for $10 million for this lease. This standby letter of credit is secured with
$10million of restricted cash. The facility leases require Intevac to pay for all normal maintenance costs. Gross rental expense was approximately $40 million, $38 million and $29 million for fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

Guarantees 
Officer and Director Indemnifications 
As permitted or required under Delaware law and to the maximum extent allowable under that law, Intevac has certain obligations to indemnify
its current and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at Intevacs request in such capacity. These indemnification obligations are valid as long as the director or
officer acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was
unlawful. The maximum potential amount of future payments Intevac could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited; however, Intevac has a director and officer insurance policy that mitigates Intevacs exposure and
enables Intevac to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of Intevacs insurance policy coverage, Intevac believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is not material. 
Other Indemnifications 
As is customary in Intevacs industry, many of Intevacs contracts provide remedies to certain third parties such as defense,
settlement, or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of its products. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have
been immaterial. Letters of Credit 
As of January2, 2016, we had letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding totaling $18 million, including the standby letter of
credit outstanding under the Santa Clara, California facility lease and a bankers guarantee which guarantees customer advances under a customer contract. These letters of credit and bank guarantees are collateralized by $18 million of
restricted cash. Warranty 
Intevac provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. Intevacs warranty is per contract terms and for its disk
manufacturing, PV manufacturing and DCP manufacturing systems the warranty typically ranges between 12 and 24 months from customer acceptance. For systems sold through a distributor, Intevac offers a 3 month warranty. The remainder of any warranty
period is the responsibility of the distributor. During this warranty period any defective non-consumable parts are replaced and installed at no charge to the customer. The warranty period on consumable parts is limited to their reasonable usable
lives. Intevac uses estimated repair or replacement costs along with its historical warranty experience to determine its warranty 
72 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
obligation. Intevac generally provides a twelve month warranty on its Photonics products. The provision for the estimated future costs of warranty is based upon historical cost and product
performance experience. Intevac exercises judgment in determining the underlying estimates. On the consolidated balance sheets, the
short-term portion of the warranty provision is included in other accrued liabilities, while the long-term portion is included in other long-term liabilities. The expense associated with product warranties issued or adjusted is included in cost of
net revenues on the consolidated statements of operations. The following table displays the activity in the warranty provision account

Legal Matters 
From time to time, Intevac receives notification from third parties, including customers and suppliers, seeking indemnification, litigation
support, payment of money or other actions in connection with claims made against them. In addition, from time to time, Intevac receives notification from third parties claiming that Intevac may be or is infringing their intellectual property or
other rights. Intevac also is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims, both asserted and unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of these claims and proceedings cannot be predicted with
certainty, Intevac does not believe that any of these other existing proceedings or claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
14. Segment and Geographic Information 
Intevacs two reportable segments are: Thin-film Equipment and Photonics. Intevacs chief operating decision-maker
has been identified as the President and CEO, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Segment information is presented based upon Intevacs management
organization structure as of January2, 2016 and the distinctive nature of each segment. Future changes to this internal financial structure may result in changes to the reportable segments disclosed. 
Each reportable segment is separately managed and has separate financial results that are reviewed by Intevacs chief operating
decision-maker. Each reportable segment contains closely related products that are unique to the particular segment. Segment operating profit is determined based upon internal performance measures used by the chief operating decision-maker. 
Intevac derives the segment results from its internal management reporting system. The accounting policies Intevac uses to derive reportable
segment results are substantially the same as those used for external reporting purposes. Management measures the performance of each reportable segment based upon several metrics, including orders, net revenues and operating income. Management uses
these results to evaluate the performance 
73 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
of, and to assign resources to, each of the reportable segments. Intevac manages certain operating expenses separately at the corporate level. Intevac allocates certain of these corporate
expenses to the segments in an amount equal to 3% of net revenues. Segment operating income excludes interest income/expense and other financial charges and income taxes according to how a particular reportable segments management is measured.
Management does not consider impairment charges, gains and losses on divestitures and sales of intellectual property, and unallocated costs in measuring the performance of the reportable segments. 
The Thin-film Equipment segment designs, develops and markets vacuum process equipment solutions for high-volume manufacturing of small
substrates with precise thin-film properties, such as for the hard drive, solar cell and DCP industries, as well as other adjacent thin-film markets. 
The Photonics segment develops compact, cost-effective, high-sensitivity digital-optical products for the capture and display of low-light
images. Intevac provides sensors, cameras and systems for government applications such as night vision and long-range target identification.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, Intevac substantially completed implementation of the 2015 cost reduction plan the
2015 Plan, which was intended to reduce expenses and reduce its workforce by 3 percent. The cost of implementing the 2015 Plan was reported under cost of net revenues and operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
Substantially all cash outlays in connection with the 2015 Plan occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Implementation of the 2015 Plan is expected to reduce salary, wages and other employee-related expenses by approximately $14 million on an
annual basis. During the first half of fiscal 2014, Intevac substantially completed implementation of the 2014 cost reduction plan the
2014 Plan, which was intended to reduce expenses and reduce its workforce by 6 percent. The cost of implementing the 2014 Plan was reported under cost of net revenues and operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
Substantially all cash outlays in connection with the 2014 Plan occurred in the first half of fiscal 2014. Implementation of the 2014 Plan reduced salary, wages and other employee-related expenses by approximately $21 million on an annual basis.
On February1, 2013, Intevac announced the 2013 cost reduction plan the 2013 Plan to reduce expenses including a
reduction in its workforce. Implementation of the 2013 Plan was substantially completed in the first half of fiscal 2013 and the Company reduced its workforce by 18 percent. The cost of implementing the 2013 Plan was reported under cost of net
revenues and operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. Substantially all cash outlays in connection with the 2013 Plan occurred in the first half of fiscal 2013. 
As of January2, 2016, activities related to the 2015, 2014 and 2013 Plans were complete.

shares of its common stock or approximately 68% of the outstanding common stock from NRC in a privately negotiated transaction at a purchase price of $498 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $74 million. The repurchase was made in
conjunction with Intevacs stock repurchase program. Matthew Drapkin, a member of Intevacs Board of Directors, is a principal of NRC and a member of BC Advisors, LLC, which is the general partner of NRC. NRC continues to beneficially own
approximately 36% of the outstanding shares of Intevacs common stock subsequent to the transaction.

Controls and Procedures Managements Report on Assessment of Internal
Controls Over Financial Reporting Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
Based on Intevacs managements evaluation with the participation of Intevacs chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, as of the end of the period covered by this report, Intevacs chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that Intevacs disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Exchange Act are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Intevac in reports that Intevac files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to Intevacs management, including Intevacs chief executive officer and chief financial

Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
for Intevac. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: ipertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the Company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of
its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management with the
participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of Intevacs internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that Intevacs internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
January2, 2016. Burr Pilger Mayer Inc., an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of Intevacs internal control over financial reporting and has issued a report on Intevacs internal control over
financial reporting, which is included in their report on the following page. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements
Report on Assessment of Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Intevac, Inc. and its
