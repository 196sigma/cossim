Vincam Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1996 and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about

disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1994, 1995 AND 1996
NOTE 1- NATURE OF THE BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Vincam Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company are a
professional employer organization PEO engaged primarily in the provision of
human resource management and personnel administration services. In addition,
the Company provides certain managed care services, including managed behavioral
health care, employee assistance programs, drug-free workplace programs,
utilization review services, comprehensive workers' compensation managed care,
risk management and loss containment services.
The Company provides PEO services primarily to small and medium sized
companies in a variety of industries, including manufacturing, retail, and
hospitality. Managed care services are provided to PEO clients and to health and
workers' compensation insurance companies, health maintenance organizations,
other managed care providers and large, self insured employers.
PEO service contracts with client companies are generally for one year
terms with automatic renewal options and subject to termination on a 30 days'
notice by either party during the first year and annually thereafter. Managed
care contracts with clients are for terms of one or more years and are subject
to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 180 days' notice depending on the
nature of the services provided.
The Company does not have a concentration of customers in any one
industry; however, during 1994, 1995 and 1996, a significant portion of the
Company revenues were generated in South Florida. The Company revenues are
generated predominantly by PEO services.
A summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the
preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements is presented
below     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION. The accompanying financial statements
include the accounts of The Vincam Group, Inc. and its principal subsidiaries,
Vincam Human Resources, Inc. VHR, Psych/Care, Inc. Psych/Care and Vincam
Occupational Health Services, Inc. VOHS. All material intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated.
REVENUE RECOGNITION. Revenues and the related costs of wages, salaries,
and employment taxes from professional employer services related to worksite
employees are recognized in the period in which the employee performs the
service. Because the Company is at risk for all of its direct costs,
independently of whether payment is received from its clients, and consistent
with industry practice, all amounts billed to clients for gross salaries and
wages, related employment taxes, and health care and workers' compensation
coverage are recognized as revenue by the Company. The Company establishes a
reserve for doubtful accounts when it determines that collection from a client
is unlikely.
Revenues from behavioral health services are recognized during the
period in which the Company is obligated to provide behavioral health services
to participants. Revenues from risk management, loss containment and workers'
compensation managed care services are recognized in the period in which the
services are performed.
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES. The preparation of financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

expenses during the reporting period. The more significant estimates relate to
the Company reserve for claims. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
RESERVE FOR CLAIMS. The Company workers' compensation benefits and
certain of its health care benefits are provided under large deductible insured
plans. The Company records reserves for workers' compensation and health care
claims costs based on actuarial calculations using the Company loss history of
workers' compensation and health care claims, including estimates of
incurred but not reported claims. Prior to 1994, the Company workers'
compensation insurance was under a loss-sensitive retrospectively rated plan
which provided for retroactive premium adjustments based on actual loss
experience.
In December 1996, the Company entered into an agreement with a national
insurance company to provide guaranteed fixed cost workers' compensation
insurance coverage for 1997 through 1999, subject to a deductible of $2,000 per
medical only claim. Accordingly, effective January 1, 1997, the Company will
record workers' compensation costs based primarily on the fixed cost portion of
the premium of its workers' compensation policy.
In addition, in December 1996, the Company entered an agreement to
reinsure its remaining claims under the Company large deductible workers'
compensation insurance policies for the years 1994, 1995, and 1996, for an
aggregate premium of $3,200,000. As a result, the Company has recorded the
premium as a reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 1996 and a deferred gain in
the amount of approximately $600,000 which will be recognized to income in
future periods based on the proportion of cumulative claims paid to the total
estimated liability for claims.
At December 31, 1995 and 1996, the Company has classified as current
the estimated amounts of reserves established for claims and reinsurance
recoverable expected to be paid and to be collected, respectively, within one
year, as well as the related deferred gain expected to be recognized within one
year.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. Property and equipment are recorded at cost.
Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over
the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Repairs and maintenance are
charged to expense as incurred, while expenditures which extend the useful lives
of the assets are capitalized.
GOODWILL. Assets and liabilities acquired in connection with business
combinations accounted for under the purchase method are recorded at their
respective estimated fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase
price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including the recognition of
applicable deferred taxes, and is amortized on a straight-line basis over a 25
year period. The Company reviews long-lived assets, identifiable intangibles and
goodwill and reserves for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
ADVERTISING COSTS. Advertising expenditures are charged to operations
as incurred. Advertising expense amounted to $333,600, $386,123 and $547,698 in
1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively.

CLIENT CONTRACTS. Costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of
client contracts from other professional employer organizations, as well as the
fair market value of contracts acquired in connection with purchase business
combinations, are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over
a period of 5 to 15 years, based on the term of the client contracts and/or the
previous professional employer organization client retention rate. The Company
periodically assesses the status of contracts acquired to determine the future
realizability of the capitalized costs. At December 31, 1995 and 1996, the
Company had recorded client contracts of $117,440 and $1,430,951, respectively
net of accumulated amortization of $0 in 1995 and $59,183 in 1996.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. Cash equivalents include investments with
original maturities of three months or less and are stated at cost which
approximates market value.
INCOME TAXES. The Company records income tax expense using the
liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Under the liability
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement
and income tax bases of the Company assets and liabilities. An allowance is
recorded when it is more likely than not that any or all of a deferred tax asset
will not be realized. The provision for income taxes includes taxes currently
payable plus the net change during the year in deferred tax assets and
liabilities recorded by the Company.
The Company is subject to certain state taxes based on gross receipts,
payroll and taxable income within that state. Taxes based on gross receipts and
payroll are classified as salaries, wages and employment taxes of worksite
employees in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, while taxes
based on income are included in the provision for income taxes.
NET INCOME PER COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARE. Net income per
common and common equivalent share has been computed based on the weighted
average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents
outstanding during each of the three years ended December 31, 1996. The Company
has considered as outstanding common stock equivalents during each of the three
years ended December 31, 1996, options awarded to employees and directors of the
Company see Notes 10 and 11. For purposes of the calculation of net income per
common and common equivalent share, the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock
is also considered a common stock equivalent.
Net income per common and common equivalent share amounts for each of
the years presented have been calculated giving retroactive effect to an
approximate 8,417 to 1 stock split effected by the Company in June 1995 and a 3
for 4 split effected on February 21, 1996 jointly, the Stock Splits, see Note
10. All common and common equivalent share amounts have also been retroactively
adjusted to reflect the Stock Splits.
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION. Effective 1996, the Company adopted the
disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123,
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation SFAS 123 and retained the intrinsic
value method of accounting for such stock based compensation see Note 11.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. The Company estimates the fair
market value of financial instruments through the use of public market prices,
quotes from financial institutions and other available information. Considerable
judgement is required in interpreting data to develop estimates of market value
and, accordingly, amounts are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the
Company could realize in a current market exchange. At December 31, 1995 and
1996, the Company financial instruments consist primarily of instruments
without extended maturities, the fair values of which, based on management
estimates, equaled their carrying values.

NOTE 7 - RESERVE FOR CLAIMS
In December 1996, the Company entered into an agreement with a national
insurance company to provide workers' compensation insurance coverage for 1997
through 1999, subject to a deductible of $2,000 per medical only claim.
Accordingly, effective January 1, 1997, the Company will record workers'
compensation costs based primarily on the fixed portion of its premium under
such policy, rather than through the previous practice of applying actuarial
estimates.
In addition, in December 1996, the Company entered into agreements to
reinsure substantially all of the remaining claims under the Company large
deductible workers' compensation insurance policies for the years 1994, 1995 and
1996 for an aggregate premium of $3,200,000. Since reserves for claims for these
years have been previously provided, the Company has recorded the premium as a
reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 1996 and a deferred gain in the amount
of approximately $600,000 which will be recognized to income in future periods
based on the proportion of cumulative claims paid to the total estimated
liabilities for claims.
In connection with the reinsurance of claims exposure from 1994 to
1996, the insurance carrier has agreed to provide letters of credit in favor of
the Company lender to guarantee outstanding letters of credit under the
Company credit agreement see Note 8. 
As a consequence of the reinsurance agreement described above, at
December 31, 1996, the Company has classified as current the estimated amounts
of reserves established for claims and reinsurance recoverable expected to be
paid and to be collected, respectively, within one year, as well as the related
deferred gain expected to be recognized within one year.

The Series A Preferred Stock was recorded at $6,263,610 in the
accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 1995 based on its fair market
value on the date of issuance, as evidenced by the sale of Series A Preferred
Stock by the Company principal stockholders to an unaffiliated party. Both the
fair market value and the costs incurred of approximately $445,000 in connection
with the recapitalization were charged to retained earnings at the time of the
transaction.
The Series A Preferred Stock was converted upon completion of the
Company initial public offering into 1,043,933 shares of common stock, after
adjusting retroactively for the effects of the Stock Splits see Note 3.
NOTE 10 - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
During June 1995, the Company increased its authorized common stock
from 500,000 shares to 39,500,000 shares and simultaneously effected an
approximate 8,417 to 1 stock split. On February 21, 1996, the Company effected a
3 for 4 reverse stock split. After the completion of the Company initial
public offering, the Company amended and restated its Articles of Incorporation
to increase the authorized number of shares of the Company common stock from
39,500,000 to 60,000,000, and to increase the authorized number of shares of
preferred stock from 500,000 to 20,000,000. All references in the financial
statements to per share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the
change in the number of common shares outstanding as a result of the Stock
Splits.
In connection with the stock split and increase in authorized shares
effected in June 1995, the Company reduced the par value of its common stock to
$001 from $100.
In June 1993, CP Investments, Inc., an entity controlled by the
Company principal stockholders, assigned to the Company an option which CP
Investments held to purchase, from a third party for $ 1 million, the land and
building which is owned by the Company and where the Company headquarters are
located. In October 1993, the Company exercised the option and purchased the
land and building. As part of the assignment of the option, CP Investments
retained the right to purchase the land and building from the Company for
$1,000,000 for a ten year period.
Based on two independent appraisals of the land and building subject to
the previously described option, the Company valued the option at $700,000
based on the difference between the market value of the building and its
November 1993 purchase price and recorded a distribution to its principal
stockholders in June 1993. Because the transaction was entered into between
commonly controlled entities, the value of the option was not considered
additional basis in the building. Amounts due in connection with this
distribution have been recorded as distribution payable at December 31, 1995 and
paid in 1996 upon completion of the initial public offering.
In January 1995, the Company entered into an agreement to reacquire
certain of its outstanding shares from a minority shareholder. Under the terms
of the agreement, the Company acquired and canceled 249,342 shares of its common
stock, after adjusting for the effect of the Stock Splits, for $300,000 in cash
and a subordinated note for $1,200,000 see Note 8. Simultaneously, the
Company principal shareholders acquired 66,281 outstanding shares of the

Subsequent to December 31, 1994, the Company requested and obtained a
change, for income tax purposes, in the method of accounting for its workers'
compensation loss reserves. As a result, the Company recorded a deferred tax
asset relating to the reserves and an increase in income taxes payable of
approximately $1,386,000. Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
IRC, the Company can amortize over three years the payment of taxes due for
changes resulting in taxable income and can recognize currently deductions
resulting from the change in method. The Company has classified as long term
those taxes resulting from this change which it expects to pay in more than one
year.

The gross amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 1995 and 1996 are

Realization of the above deferred tax assets is dependent on generating
sufficient taxable income in the future to offset the deductible temporary
differences generating the deferred tax assets. Although realization is not
assured, management believes that it is more likely than not that all of the
deferred tax asset will be realized. The amount of the deferred tax asset
considered realizable, however, could be reduced if estimates of future taxable
income are reduced.
A reconciliation of the differences between income taxes computed at
the federal statutory tax rate and the income tax provisions reflected in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income is as follows                     1994      1995      1996

NOTE 13 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company maintains a defined contribution plan covering certain of
its worksite employees for a number of client companies. The Company
contributes, on behalf of each participating client, varying amounts based on
client company elections. Total Company contributions for the years ended
December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996 were $416,922, $550,776 and $1,065,072,
respectively.
In August 1996, the Company received a favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service IRS regarding the qualified status of its
defined contribution plan under Section 401k of the IRC. In its application to
the IRS, the Company informed the IRS that the Company is involved in the
business of leasing employees to client companies and that the 401k plan
covered worksite or leased employees who satisfied the plan eligibility
requirements.
The Company sponsors an unfunded deferred compensation plan the
Deferred Plan. The Deferred Plan covers a selected group of employees as
determined by the Company Board of Directors. The amounts due under the
Deferred Plan are based on bonuses granted by the Board of Directors, at its
discretion at each year end for that year performance by the employee. Based
on the awards granted, the Company recorded compensation expense of $41,200
during 1994. No deferred compensation expense was recognized during 1995 and
1996.
The amount of compensation subject to the Deferred Plan and the vesting
period for individual grants, or any changes thereto, is established by the
Company Board of Directors. Deferred compensation amounts generally vest at
the end of three years from the date of award, provided the participant is
employed by the Company on such date. At December 31, 1996 the vesting schedule
under the Plan is as follows 1997. $ 242,013
1998.   41,200
$ 283,213
The Company has included these amounts within other liabilities in the
accompanying balance sheets as short term or long term based on the applicable
vesting dates. Of the above amounts, approximately $200,000 at December 31,
1996, relate to deferred compensation to the Company s principal stockholders.
All deferred compensation is expected to be paid in cash.
NOTE 14 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company has entered into non-compete agreements with its Chairman
and Vice-Chairman, who are also the Company principal stockholders. The
agreements are for a term to be specified by the Company, not to exceed two
years, in the event of the Chairman or Vice-Chairman termination. The
non-compete agreements require payment to the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of
their full salary and benefits during the term of the agreement.

The Company leases certain office space, automobiles and office
equipment under non-cancelable operating leases expiring on various dates
through the year 2000. Total rent expense charged to operations during the years

The Company is a defendant in a lawsuit related to a wrongful death and
premises liability claim involving a worksite employee. The plaintiff original
complaint sought damages in excess of $10,000,000; however, such complaint was
dismissed in part and amended to seek damages in excess of $15,000. The court
has sustained plaintiff amended complaint alleging premises liability against
both the Company and its client as a result of a worksite accident at client
premises. The Company is asserting that its liability under this claim, if any,
should be limited to $100,000 due to the immunity provisions of the Florida
workers' compensation statute involving worksite accidents. Discovery in the
proceeding continues. While there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome
of this lawsuit will not have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial condition or results of operations, management believes, based on
consultations with the Company counsel, that the ultimate outcome of this
lawsuit should not have such an effect.
The Company is a defendant in a lawsuit brought in Dade County Circuit
Court in November 1995 by an individual who alleges that he was injured by a
worksite employee of a client of the Company, which owns and operates a hotel
and is a co-defendant in the litigation. The plaintiff alleges that the
employee, while he was working as a valet parking attendant, was negligent in a
motor vehicle collision and severely and permanently injured the plaintiff. The
plaintiff alleged damages in excess of $50,000 in his amended complaint for,
among other things, bodily injury, medical costs, pain and suffering, and lost
ability to earn income. Based on consultations with the Company counsel,
management of the Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the
plaintiff claims and that if the lawsuit is adversely determined, the Company
may be entitled to indemnification from its client and/or its liability
insurance carrier. Although management believes that the company ultimate
liability in this matter should not be material, there can be no assurance that
the Company will prevail in the litigation, in a related claim for
indemnification, or that the liability of the Company, if any, would not have a
material adverse effect on the Company financial condition and results of
operations.
In October 1996, the Company received a notice of assessment in the
discounted amount of approximately $53,500 from The Treasurer of the State of
Florida Department of Insurance as Receiver of United States Employer Consumer
Self Insurance Fund of Florida, a workers compensation insurance fund which was
declared insolvent the Fund. The Company paid the assessment in January
1997. The Company had certain worksite employees covered by the Fund during
fiscal years ended December 31, 1992, 1993 and 1994.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1994, 1995 AND 1996
The court order authorizing the assessment provides that the Company, by paying
the discounted assessment, is deemed to have paid its assessment in full and is
not subject to any further assessment for policyholder loss claims. The Company
may be subject to additional liability for the assessments of other Fund
members. The Company believes that there are approximately 700 members of the
Fund which have been assessed $370 million in the aggregate. Although the
amount of the potential exposure, if any, for such additional liability is not
yet determinable, management believes that the Company has meritorious defenses
to the assessment and that its ultimate liability in this matter will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company financial condition or results of
operations. There cannot, however, be any assurance that any such liability will
not have such material adverse effect.
The company is also involved in other legal and administrative
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The outcomes of these
actions are not expected to have a material effect on the Company financial
position or results of operations.     See also Notes 1 and 7.
