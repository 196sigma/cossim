30 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Shareholders and Board of Directors   of Olympic Steel, Inc.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Olympic Steel, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December31, 2009 and 2008, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2009 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
a2 presents fairly, in all material respects,
the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2009, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible
for these financial statements and financial statement schedule,
for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
on these financial statements, on the financial statement
schedule and on the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP   Cleveland, Ohio   February25, 2010   
31 Table of Contents   MANAGEMENTS
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements.   Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2009.
In making this assessment, our management used the criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on our
assessment, we concluded that, as of December31, 2009, our
internal control over financial reporting was effective based on
those criteria.   The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2009 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   
Principles of Consolidation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Olympic Steel, Inc. and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries collectively, the Company or Olympic, after
elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.
Investment in the Companys joint venture is accounted for
under the equity method.   
Nature of Business   The Company is a U.S.steel service center with over
55years of experience in specialized processing and
distribution of large volumes of carbon, coated, aluminum and
stainless steel, flat-rolled sheet, and coil and plate products
from 16 facilities throughout the United States. The Company
operates as one business segment.   
Accounting Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.   
Concentration Risks   The Company is a major customer of flat-rolled coil and plate
steel for many of its principal suppliers, but is not dependent
on any one supplier. The Company purchased approximately 38   46% and 45% of its total steel requirements from its three
largest suppliers in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.   The Company has a diversified customer and geographic base,
which reduces the inherent risk and cyclicality of its business.
The concentration of net sales to the Companys top 20
customers approximated 30%, 33% and 34% of net sales in 2009,
2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, the Companys
largest customer accounted for approximately 3%, 6% and 8% of
net sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Sales to the
three largest U.S.automobile manufacturers and their
suppliers, made principally by the Companys Detroit
operation, and sales to other steel service centers, accounted
for approximately 116% and 110%, respectively, of the
Companys net sales in 2009, 85% and 100% of net sales in
2008, and 85% and 90% of net sales in 2007.   Cash
and Cash Equivalents   Cash equivalents consist of short-term highly liquid
investments, with a three month or less maturity, which are
readily convertible into cash.   Fair
Market Value   Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be
received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the
principal or most advantageous market for the liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants on the
measurement date. Valuation techniques must maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
To measure fair value, the Company applies a fair value
hierarchy that is based on three levels of inputs, of which the
first two are considered observable and the last unobservable,
as follows   Level1 Quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities.   
37 Table of Contents   Level2 Inputs other than Level1
that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices
that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can
be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the
full term of the assets or liabilities.   Level3 Unobservable inputs that are
supported by little or no market activity and that are
significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.   Financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and the credit facility
revolver, are stated at their carrying value, which is a
reasonable estimate of fair value. The fair value of marketable
securities is based on quoted market prices.   
Accounts Receivable   Accounts receivable are presented net of allowances for doubtful
accounts of $665 and $1,103 as of December31, 2009 and
2008, respectively. Bad debt expense totaled $268 in 2009,
$1,378 in 2008 and $493 in 2007.   The Companys allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained
at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience
and specific customer collection issues that the Company has
identified. Estimations are based upon a calculated percentage
of accounts receivable, which remains fairly level from year to
year, and judgments about the probable effects of economic
conditions on certain customers, which can fluctuate
significantly from year to year. The Company cannot guarantee
that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past
experience.   
Inventories   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and
include the costs of purchased steel, inbound freight, external
processing and applicable labor and overhead costs related to
internal processing. Cost is determined using the specific
identification method. On the Consolidated Statement of
Operations, Cost of materials sold exclusive of items
shown separately below consists of the cost of purchased
steel, inbound and internal transfer freight, external
processing costs, scrap and inventory lower of cost or market
adjustments.   
Property and Equipment, and Depreciation   Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is
provided using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets ranging from 5 to 30years. The
Company capitalizes the costs of obtaining or developing
internal-use software, including directly related payroll costs.
The Company amortizes those costs over five years, beginning
when the software is ready for its intended use.   
Goodwill   Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair
value of the net assets of an acquired business. Goodwill is not
amortized, but is tested annually or more frequently for
impairment.   The goodwill on the consolidate balance sheets is related to the
June2, 2006 acquisition of our North Carolina operations.   For purposes of impairment testing, which is conducted December
31 of each year, the Company determined fair value using a
discounted cash flow methodology. As of December31, 2009,
goodwill totaled $66million and the testing indicated no
impairment of goodwill.   
Income Taxes   The Company, on its consolidated balance sheets, records as an
offset to the estimated effect of temporary differences between
the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts
in its consolidated balance sheets, the tax effect of operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards. If the Company determines
that it will not be able to fully realize a deferred tax asset,
it will record a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax
asset to its realizable value. We recognize interest accrued
related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
Penalties, if incurred, would be recognized as a component of
income tax expense.   
38 Table of Contents   
Revenue Recognition   For both direct and toll shipments, revenue is recognized when
steel is shipped to the customer and title and risk of loss is
transferred which generally occurs upon delivery to our
customers. Given the proximity of our customers to our
facilities, substantially all of the Companys sales are
shipped and received within one day. Sales returns and
allowances are treated as reductions to sales and are provided
for based on historical experience and current estimates and are
immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.   
Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs   Amounts charged to customers for shipping and other
transportation are included in net sales. The distribution
expense line on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of
Operations is entirely comprised of all shipping and other
transportation costs incurred by the Company in shipping goods
to its customers.   
Impairment   The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets
and the related estimated remaining lives whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that
could trigger an impairment review include significant
underperformance relative to the expected historical or
projected future operating results, significant changes in the
manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the
overall business or significant negative industry or economic
trends. The Company records an impairment or change in useful
life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life
has changed.   
Stock-Based Compensation   Since 2006, the Company records compensation expense for stock
options issued to employees and directors. Prior to 2006, the
Company accounted for stock options granted to employees and
directors under the intrinsic value method, where no
compensation expense was recognized. The Company has elected to
use the modified prospective transition method where
compensation expense is recorded prospectively. For additional
information, see Note9, Stock Options.   
Subsequent Events   The Company has evaluated subsequent events for recognition or
disclosure through February25, 2010, which was the date
this
Form10-K
was filed with the SEC.   
Impact of Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements   In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 810,
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements an amendment of Accounting Research
BulletinNo51. This guidance requires all
entities to report noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries
also known as minority interests as a separate component of
equity in the consolidated statement of financial position, to
clearly identify consolidated net income attributable to the
parent and to the controlling interest on the face of the
consolidated statement of income and to provide sufficient
disclosure that clearly identifies and distinguishes between the
interest of the parent and the interests of controlling owners.
The new guidance under FASB Topic 810 is effective as of
January1, 2009. The adoption of the new guidance under
FASB Topic 810 did not have any impact as the Company does not
currently have any non-controlling interests in its subsidiaries.   In December 2007, the FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB
ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. This guidance
requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to
recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the
transaction, establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the
measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities
assumed and requires the acquirer to disclose certain
information related to the nature and financial effect of the
business combination. The new guidance under FASB ASC Topic 805
is effective for business combinations entered into in fiscal
years beginning on or after December15, 2008. Depending on
the terms   
39 Table of Contents   conditions and details of the business combinations, if any,
that take place subsequent to January1, 2009, the new
guidance under FASB ASC Topic 805may have a material
impact on the Companys future financial statements.   In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB ASC
Topic 855, Subsequent Events. This guidance establishes
general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events
that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial
statements are issued or are available to be issued. The new
guidance under FASB ASC Topic 855 is effective for interim or
annual periods ending after June15, 2009. The adoption of
the new guidance under FASB ASC Topic 855 did not have a
material impact on the Companys financial statements.

Investments
in Joint Ventures   The Company and the United States Steel Corporation USS each
own 50% of Olympic Laser Processing OLP, a company that
produced laser welded sheet steel blanks for the automotive
industry. OLP ceased operations during the first quarter of
2006. In December 2006, the Company advanced $3,200 to OLP to
cover a loan guarantee. As of December31, 2009, the
investment in and advance to OLP was valued at $2,500 on the
Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company believes
the underlying value of OLPs remaining real estate, upon
liquidation, will be sufficient to repay the $2,500 advance at a
later date.

Retirement
Plans   The Companys retirement plans consist of a 401k plan
covering non-union employees, two separate 401k plans covering
all union employees and a supplemental executive retirement plan
SERP covering certain executive officers of the Company.   Company contributions to the non-union profit-sharing plan are
discretionary amounts as determined annually by the Board of
Directors. The 401k retirement plans allow eligible employees
to contribute up to the statutory maximum. The Companys
401k matching contribution is determined annually by the Board
of Directors and is based on a percentage of eligible
employees earnings and contributions. For the non-union
401k retirement plan in the first quarter of 2009 and for all
of 2008 and 2007, the Company matched one-half of each eligible
employees contribution, limited to the first 6% of
eligible compensation. The Companys 401k matching
contribution was suspended on April1, 2009. The
Companys discretionary profit sharing contribution is
determined annually by the Board of Directors.   Company contributions for each of the last three years for the
union plans were 3% of eligible
W-2 wages
plus one half of the first 4% of each employees
contribution. However, the Company contribution to the
Minneapolis plate facility union was suspended on April1,
2009 and the Company contribution to the Detroit facility union
was suspended on October1, 2009.   In 2005, the Board of Directors adopted the SERP. Contributions
to the SERP are based on: ia portion of the
participants compensation multiplied by 13%; and
iia portion of the participants compensation
multiplied by a factor which is contingent upon the
Companys return on invested capital. Benefits are subject
to a vesting schedule of up to five years.   Retirement plan expense, which includes all Company 401k,
profit-sharing and SERP contributions, amounted to $646, $3,950
and $3,019 for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively.

Stock
Options   In January 1994, the Stock Option Plan Option Plan was adopted
by the Board of Directors and approved by the shareholders of
the Company. The Option Plan terminated on January5, 2009.
Termination of the Option Plan did not affect outstanding
options. A total of 1,300,000shares of common stock were
originally reserved for issuance under the Option Plan. To the
extent possible, shares of treasury stock were used to satisfy
shares resulting from the exercise of stock options. Options
vested over periods ranging from six months to five years and
all expire 10years after the grant date.   The following table summarized the impact of stock options on
the results of operations

benefits realized from option exercises totaled $86 thousand,
$18million and $32million, respectively.   The fair value of each option grant was estimated as of the date

changes in the Companys historical common stock price over
a timeframe similar to that of the expected life of the award.   The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2007
was $2255. No options were granted during 2008 or 2009.

exercise of stock options, exclusive of income tax benefits,
were $112, $1,066, and $1,500 for the years ended
December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Income tax
benefits of $86, $1,819 and $3,200 were realized from stock
option exercises during the years ended December31, 2009,

taxes, with respect to non-vested stock option awards has yet to
be recognized and will be amortized into expense over a
weighted-average period of 033years.

Restricted
Stock Units and Performance Share Units   The Olympic Steel 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan the Plan was
approved by the Companys shareholders in 2007. The Plan
authorizes the Company to grant stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units,
performance shares, and other stock- and cash-based awards to
employees and Directors of, and consultants to, the Company and
its affiliates. Under the Plan, 500,000shares of common
stock are available for equity grants.   On May1, 2007, January2, 2008 and January2,
2009, the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of
Directors approved the grant of 1,800 restricted stock units
RSUs to each non-employee director. Subject to the terms of
the Plan and the RSU agreement, the RSUs vested after one year
of service from the date of grant. The RSUs are not converted
into shares of common stock until the director either resigns or
is terminated from the Board of Directors.   The Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of
Directors also granted 32,378, 34,379 and 54,024
performance-earned restricted stock units PERSUs to the senior
management of the Company on May1, 2007, January2,
2008 and January2, 2009, respectively. The PERSUs may be
earned based on the Companys performance over periods
ranging from 32 to 36months from the date of grant, and
would be converted into shares of common stock, based on the
achievement of two separate financial measures: 1the
Companys EBITDA 50% weighted; and 2return on
invested capital 50% weighted. No shares will be earned unless
the threshold amounts for the performance measures are met. Up
to 150% of the targeted amount of PERSUs may be earned.   The fair value of each RSU and PERSU was estimated to be the
closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of
grant, which was $3263, $3220 and $2168 for the grants on
January2, 2009, January2, 2008 and May1, 2007,
respectively.

machinery and equipment under long-term lease agreements. All
leases are classified as operating and expire at various dates
through 2017. In some cases the leases include options to
extend. Rent and lease expense was $4,986, $5,010 and $4,223 for
the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

are ordinary in nature and incidental to the operation of its
business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of the
proceedings to which the Company is currently a party will not
have a material adverse effect upon its results of operations,
financial condition or cash flows.   In the normal course of business, the Company periodically
enters into agreements that incorporate indemnification
provisions. While the maximum amount to which the Company may be
exposed under such agreements can not be estimated, it is the
opinion of management that these indemnifications are not
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys
results of operations or financial condition.   As of December31, 2009, approximately 157 of the
Companys hourly plant personnel at its Minneapolis and
Detroit facilities are represented by three separate collective
bargaining units. A collective bargaining agreement covering
Detroit workers was extended through August31, 2012. A
collective bargaining agreement covering Minneapolis plate
facility workers was extended through March31, 2012. A
collective bargaining agreement covering Minneapolis coil
facility workers expires on September30, 2010.

Shareholder
Rights Plan   On January31, 2000, the Companys Board of Directors
approved the adoption of a shareholder rights plan. The terms
and description of the plan are set forth in a rights agreement,

City Bank, as rights agent the Rights Agreement. The Board of
Directors declared a dividend distribution of one right for each

a share of SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred stock,
without par value, at a price of $20 per one one-hundredth of a
preferred share a Right. The Rights expire on March6,
2010, unless earlier redeemed, exchanged or amended. Rights
become exercisable to purchase preferred shares following the
commencement of certain tender offer or exchange offer
solicitations resulting in beneficial ownership of 15% or more
of the Companys outstanding common shares, as defined in
the Rights Agreement.   On September16, 2008, the Company adopted Amendment 1 to
the Rights Agreement. The Amendment removed National City Bank
as rights agent, appointed Mellon Investor Services LLC as
successor rights agent, modified several provisions related to
duties, obligations and liabilities of the rights agent and
