NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.   ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY
Endocare, Inc. the Company is a medical device company that develops,
manufactures and markets cryosurgical and stent technologies for applications in
oncology and urology. The Company also operates a mobile cryosurgery business.
The Company has concentrated on developing devices for the treatment of the two
most common diseases of the prostate, prostate cancer and benign prostate
hyperplasia. The Company is also developing cryosurgical technologies for
treating tumors in other organs, including the kidney, breast and liver.
2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Endocare, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary Advanced Medical
Procedures, Inc. All intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: All highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.
Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost first-in,
first-out or net realizable value.
Property and Equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost and are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
respective assets, which range from two to five years. Leasehold improvements
are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or
the related lease term. Cryosurgical equipment placed at customer sites for use
with the Company disposable Cryoprobes TM is depreciated into product cost
of sales over estimated useful lives of three years.
Long-Lived Assets: The Company reviews property, equipment, and intangible
assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that
the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future
undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset, an
impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying value of the asset
over its fair value. In accordance with management policies, during 2000, the
Company recorded a $100,000 impairment charge for certain non-revenue producing,
cryosurgical fixed asset placements. The amount represents the net book value
of the product, as the fair value of these assets was determined to be nominal.
Deferred Financing Costs: Deferred financing costs are amortized to interest
expense over the lives of the respective debt.
Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes product revenue upon the shipment of
its products, including the shipment of disposable products to customer sites
where the Company has placed cryosurgical systems. Revenue from mobile
cryosurgical procedures is recognized upon completion of procedures. Revenue
from collaborative agreements are recognized as the related activities are
performed or milestones are met. Realizability of accounts receivable is
determined based upon an understanding of the financial condition of, and prior
history with, the buyer and overall historical experience. In December 1999,
the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB 101. SAB 101, as
amended, was effective October 1, 2000 and provides the SEC views in applying
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles to selected revenue recognition issues.
The adoption of SAB 101 did not cause a material change to the Company
existing revenue recognition policies.
Warranty Costs: Certain of the Company products are covered by warranties
against defects in material and workmanship for periods of up to twelve months.
The estimated warranty cost is recorded at the time of sale and is adjusted
periodically to reflect actual experience.
Research and Development: Research and development costs relate to both present
and future products and are expensed as incurred.
Net Loss Per Share: The Company has adopted SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share.
Under SFAS 128, basic EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings loss by the
weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS
reflects the potential dilution to basic EPS that could occur upon conversion or
exercise of securities, options, convertible debentures, or other such items, to
common shares using the treasury stock method based upon the weighted-average
fair value of the Company common shares during the period. In accordance with
SFAS 128, the consolidated loss numerator, shares denominator and per-share
amount for fiscal 1998 are $4,924,564, 10,062,000 and $049, respectively,
the consolidated loss numerator, shares denominator and per-share amount for
fiscal 1999 are $9,264,175, 10,838,000 and $086, respectively, and the
consolidated loss numerator, shares denominator and per-share amount for
fiscal 2000 are $12,399,626, 12,757,000 and $097, respectively. As the
Company has been in a net loss position for the fiscal years 1998, 1999, and
2000, the potential dilution from the conversion of options, warrants and
convertible debentures to common stock of 2,549,000, 3,953,000 and 4,332,027 as
of December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively, were not used to compute
diluted loss per share as the effect was antidilutive. Consequently, diluted EPS
equals basic EPS for all periods presented.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The carrying amount of cash and cash
equivalents approximates fair value for all periods presented because of the
short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amounts of all
other financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheets approximate their
fair values.
Comprehensive Income: The Company has adopted SFAS No. 130 SFAS 130,
Reporting Comprehensive Income. This statement establishes rules for the
reporting of comprehensive income and its components. The adoption of SFAS 130
did not impact the Company consolidated financial statements or related
disclosures as the Company does not have any components of other comprehensive
income. Therefore, comprehensive income loss equaled net income loss for
all periods presented.
Segment Disclosures: The Company has adopted SFAS No. 131 SFAS 131,
Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS 131
establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. The
Company operates in one industry segment - the design, manufacture and marketing
of surgical devices and related procedures to treat prostate diseases.
3.   MERGER
On June 30, 1999, Endocare acquired all the outstanding units of Advanced
Medical Procedures, LLC, a Florida limited liability company AMP. AMP
operates a mobile cryosurgery business which provides cryosurgical equipment for
the treatment of prostate and liver cancer on a procedural basis. The
acquisition was consummated pursuant to a Plan of Merger the AMP Merger
Agreement by and among AMP, Endocare, and Advanced Medical Procedures, Inc.
AMPI, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Endocare.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, AMP was merged with and into AMPI, with AMPI
surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Endocare. The AMP unitholders
received an aggregate of 260,000 shares of Endocare Common Stock in exchange for
all of their AMP units. The acquisition was accounted for as a
pooling-of-interests for financial reporting purposes. The pooling-of-interests
method of accounting is intended to present as a single interest two or more
common stockholders' interests which were previously independent; accordingly,
the historical financial statements for the periods prior to the merger have
been restated as though the companies had been combined. Fees and expenses
related to the merger were expensed as incurred and amounted to approximately
$50,000. 4.   SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATA                                 YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

three years the Debentures. Interest was payable annually in cash or, at
the Company option, in common stock at a price per share based on recent bid
prices prior to the date interest is paid. Under the financing arrangements,
the purchasers had options to purchase additional debentures for the aggregate
principal amounts of $5,000,000 and $3,000,000.  Under the circumstances
described below, the Company could require the purchasers to exercise these
purchase options. The $5,000,000 principal amount of the Debentures was
originally due on June 7, 2002, and was eligible for conversion into the
Company common stock in whole or in part at the purchasers' option at any time
on or prior to June 7, 2002 at a conversion price of $5125 per share. The
$3,000,000 principal amount of the Debentures was originally due on July 29,
2002, and was eligible for conversion into the Company common stock in whole
or in part at the purchasers' option at any time, subject to certain
restrictions, on or prior to July 29, 2002 at a conversion price of $600 per
share. The conversion prices were subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments.
In addition to the purchasers' option to convert the $5,000,000 principal amount
of the Debentures, the Company could have required the purchaser to convert the
Debentures into common stock at a conversion price of $5125 per share subject
to certain anti-dilution adjustments if the bid price for the common stock as
listed for quotation was above $800 per share for twenty 20 trading days
during a consecutive 30 trading day period, and certain other conditions were
met. Subject to certain restrictions, the Company could have required that the
purchasers convert the $3,000,000 principal amount of the debentures into common
stock at a conversion price of $600 per share subject to certain anti-dilution
adjustments if the bid price for the common stock as listed for quotation was
above $900 per share for twenty 20 trading days during a consecutive thirty
30 trading day period, and certain other conditions were met. During the
second quarter of 2000, the original $8,000,000 in convertible debentures sold
to the investors in 1999 were converted into 1,475,610 shares of common stock
under the terms of the original agreements.
Under a securities purchase agreement, the purchasers had a call option
exercisable at any time prior to June 7, 2002 to require that the Company sell
to the purchasers an additional $5,000,000 principal amount of debentures. The
additional debentures mature three years from the date they are issued, bear
interest at 7% per annum and are convertible in whole or in part at a conversion
price of $675 per share subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. The
Company had a put option to require the purchasers to buy the $5,000,000
principal amount of additional debentures if the closing bid price for the
common stock as listed for quotation was more that $1000 per share for the
twenty 20 trading days in a consecutive 30 trading day period and on the
date the Company elected to exercise the put option, and if certain other
conditions were met. The purchasers also had a call option exercisable at any
time prior to July 29, 2002 to require the Company to sell to the purchasers an
additional $3,000,000 principal amount of debentures. The additional debentures
mature three years from the date they are issued, bear interest at 7% per annum
and are convertible in whole or in part at the option of the purchasers at any
time prior to maturity into common stock at a conversion price of $675 per
share subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. The Company had a put
option to require the purchasers to buy the $3,000,000 principal amount of
additional debentures if the closing bid price for the common stock as listed
for quotation was more than $900 per share for twenty 20 trading days in a
consecutive thirty 30 trading day period and on the date the Company elected
to exercise the put option, and certain other conditions were met. On May 5,
2000, the Company received $8,000,000 from the sale of the additional 7%
convertible debentures to institutional investors pursuant to the purchase
options discussed above of which $500,000 was converted into 74,074 shares of
common stock during the fourth quarter of 2000. Financing costs totaling
$585,000 associated with the transaction are being amortized to interest expense
over three years. The same investors originally purchased the $8,000,000 of
convertible debentures in 1999. In 2000, the Company issued 38,861 shares of
common stock for $549,098 in interest payable.
The fair value of the purchasers' two call options described above totaling
$1,600,000, was estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model and was
reflected in deferred financing costs and other assets in the accompanying
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 1999. This amount was
being amortized to interest expense over the original lives of the call options.
The net unamortized balance totaling $1,156,863 was reclassified to additional
paid in capital upon conversion of the original $8,000,000 of convertible
debentures into common stock.
Credit Facility
On July 29, 1999, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with a
lender which originally provided for a revolving credit line in the amount of
$2,000,000 plus up to an additional $1,000,000 based on eligible accounts
receivable of the Company the Loan. In April 2000, the Company increased
the revolving portion of its credit facility from $2,000,000 to $4,000,000 in
addition to the $1,000,000 based on eligible accounts receivable of the Company.
As of December 31, 1999 and 2000, $2,000,000 and $1,000,000, respectively, of
the loan was outstanding. The Loan matures and all amounts must be repaid on
July 31, 2001. The Loan bears interest at the highest prime or equivalent rate
announced by certain designated banks, plus 2% for the option of the loan based
on eligible accounts receivable or 35%. The Loan is secured by a first
priority lien on all of the assets of the Company, except for intellectual
property, is fully guaranteed by the Company subsidiary, and contains certain
restrictive covenants.  The Company is in compliance with the restrictive
covenants of the agreement as of December 31, 2000.
Long-term debt is comprised of convertible debentures as of December 31, 2000.
Aggregate maturities of long-term debt are zero, zero and $7,500,000 for the
years ending December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. The balance of the
long-term liabilities of approximately $74,000 as of December 2000, consists
primarily of a capital lease obligation and equipment loan.
6.   PRIVATE PLACEMENTS
In April 1998, the Company sold 2,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of
$350 per share in a direct private placement. After legal, accounting, filing
fees and other associated expenses of approximately $150,000, the net
contribution to the Company capital was approximately $6,886,000.
In November 2000, the Company sold 1,509,440 shares of its common stock at a
price of $1325 per share in a private placement. In addition, warrants to
purchase up to an aggregate of 188,680 shares of the Company common stock were
issued to the investors at an exercise price of $139125 per share. The
warrants are exercisable for a term of five years from the date of issuance.
After transaction fees, legal, accounting, filing fees and other associated
expenses of approximately $1,648,000 the net contribution to the Company
capital was approximately $18,352,000.
7.   STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS
At December 31, 2000, Endocare had two stock-based compensation plans, as
described below. Per FASB Statement No. 123, the Company has elected to apply
APB Opinion No. 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for its plans.
The 1995 Stock Plan authorizes the Board or one or more committees which the
Board may appoint from among its members the Committee to grant options and
rights to purchase common stock to employees and certain consultants and
distributors. Options granted under the 1995 Stock Plan may be either incentive
stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, or nonstatutory stock options, as determined by the Board or the
Committee. The exercise price of options granted under the 1995 Stock Plan is
equal to the fair market value of Endocare common stock on the date of grant.
Options generally vest 25% on the one year anniversary date, with the remaining
75% vesting monthly over the following three years. Options are exercisable for
ten years. A total of 3,649,449 shares of common stock have been reserved for
issuance under the 1995 Stock Plan, subject to an automatic annual share
increase to which the number of shares available for issuance under the plan
will automatically increase on the first trading day of each calendar year by 3%
of the total number of shares of the Company common stock outstanding at the
end of the preceding calendar year, to a maximum of 500,000 shares each year. As
of December 31, 2000, options to purchase a total of 3,510,247 shares of the
Company common stock have been granted under the 1995 Stock Plan.
The 1995 Director Option Plan the Director Plan was adopted by the Board of
Directors the Board in October 1995 and approved by the shareholders in
November 1995. It provides automatic, nondiscretionary grants of options to
Endocare non-employee directors Outside Directors. The Director Plan
provides that each Outside Director is granted an option to purchase 20,000
shares of Endocare common stock vested over a two-year period upon his or her
initial election or appointment as an Outside Director. Subsequently, each
Outside Director who has served for at least six months will be granted an
additional option to purchase 5,000 shares of Endocare common stock, on January
1 of each year, or the first trading day thereafter, so long as he or she
remains an Outside Director. The exercise price of options granted to Outside
Directors must be the fair market value of Endocare common stock on the date of
grant. Options granted to Outside Directors have ten-year terms, subject to an
Outside Director continued service as a director. The Subsequent Options
granted to the Outside Directors become fully exercisable on the first
anniversary of the date of grant. A total of 300,000 shares of common stock has
been reserved for issuance under the Director Plan. As of December 31, 2000,
options to purchase a total of 130,000 shares of the Company common stock have
been granted under the Director Plan. The following tables summarize Endocare option activity under both plans                     1998           1999            2000

Warrants generally vest over a one to five year period and have been provided in
conjunction with financing transactions, patent licenses and service contracts.
As of December 31, 2000, the Company had 469,326 warrants outstanding, of which
358,076 are exercisable. Warrant exercise prices range from $231 to $1540 per
share. During 1999 and 2000, 136,250 and 186,400 warrants, respectively, were
exercised, and no warrants were exercised in 1998. The Company amortizes the
fair values of warrants associated with non-equity transactions, as determined
using the Black-Scholes option pricing method, to expense over the service
period of the related warrants. The Company records warrants issued in
connection with equity transactions in additional paid in capital, as
determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
8.   STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
On March 5, 1999, the Company Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights
Plan Plan in which preferred stock purchase rights will be distributed as a
dividend at the rate of one Right for each share of Common Stock held as of the
close of business on April 15, 1999. Each Right will entitle Stockholders to
buy one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company at
an Exercise Price of $25. The Rights are designed to guard against partial
tender offers and other coercive tactics that might be used in an attempt to
gain control of the Company or to deprive Stockholders of their interests in the
long-term value of the Company. The Rights will be exercisable only if a person
or group acquires 15% or more of the Company Common Stock subject to certain
exceptions stated in the Plan or announces a tender offer, the consummation of
which would result in ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of the
Company Common Stock. Each Right will entitle stockholders to buy one
one-thousandth of a share of new series of junior participating preferred stock
at an exercise price of $25 upon certain events. If a person or group acquires
15% or more of the Company outstanding Common Stock subject to certain
exceptions stated in the Plan, or a holder of 15% or more of the Company
Common Stock engages in certain self-dealing transactions or a merger
transaction in which the Company is the surviving corporation and its Common
Stock remains outstanding, then each Right not owned by such person or certain
related parties will entitle its holder to purchase, at the Right then-current
exercise price, units of the Company Series A Preferred Stock or, in certain
circumstances, Company Common Stock, cash, property or other securities of the
Company having a market value equal to twice the then-current exercise price.
In addition, if, after the Rights become exercisable, Endocare, Inc. is acquired
in a merger or other business combination transaction, or sells 50% or more of
its assets or earnings power, each Right will entitle its holder to purchase, at
the Right then-current price, a number of the acquiring company common
shares having a market value at the time of twice the Right exercise price.
At any time on or prior to the close of business on the first date of a public
announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or
more of the Company Common Stock subject to certain exceptions stated in the
Plan, the Rights are redeemable for one cent per Right at the option of the
Board of Directors. The Rights are intended to enable all stockholders to
realize the long-term value of their investment in the Company. The Rights will
not prevent a takeover attempt, but should encourage anyone seeking to acquire
the Company to negotiate with the Board prior to attempting to a takeover. The
dividend distribution was made on April 15, 1999 payable to stockholders of
record on that date. The Rights will expire on April 15, 2009.
9.   INCOME TAXES
Income tax expense, which is included as an operating expense in the Company
consolidated statements of operations, consisted of                YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

ended December 31, 1999 and 2000, respectively. The Company has recognized that
it is not more likely than not that future tax benefits will be realized as a
result of future and current income. Accordingly, the valuation allowance has
been increased to fully reserve the deferred tax assets.
Actual income tax expense differs from amounts computed by applying the U.S.

As of December 31, 2000, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for
federal income tax purposes of approximately $29,219,000 which are available to
offset future federal taxable income, if any, through the year 2020. For state
income tax purposes, the Company has net operating losses of approximately
$16,795,000 which are available to offset future state taxable income, if any,
through the year 2005.
In accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 382, the annual utilization of
net operating loss carryforwards and credits existing prior to a change in
control may be limited. No such changes in control occurred during 2000.
10.   COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS
Boston Scientific: In March 1999, Endocare exercised its right, at no cost to
the Company, to terminate a distribution agreement with Boston Scientific, which
was originally entered into in November 1996. This agreement granted Boston
Scientific exclusive worldwide marketing rights for Endocare Cryocare System
for urology and a purchase right on the technology. Under the original
distribution agreement, Boston Scientific guaranteed Endocare certain minimum
purchases of Cryocare Systems over a five -year period, subject to certain
conditions and renegotiations. In addition, Boston Scientific committed to pay
Endocare four payments of $250,000 each, based upon meeting certain specified
milestones. The first milestone payment, based upon contract signing, was
received in November 1996, and revenue was recognized in the fourth quarter of
1996. Due to continuing obligations of the Company to Boston Scientific, cash
related to the second milestone of $250,000 was received in December 1996 and
was being recognized as earned. The remaining obligations relating to this
second milestone were fulfilled in 1998 and the remaining deferred revenue of
$166,672 recognized. In 1998, Boston Scientific paid additional nonrefundable
licensing payments of $475,000 to Endocare.
Sanarus Medical, Inc.: In October 1999, the Company entered into a strategic
alliance with Sanarus Medical, Inc. Sanarus to commercialize Endocare
proprietary cryosurgical technology in the treatment of breast tumors and
gynecological diseases. The terms of the related agreements included an equity
investment by Endocare in Sanarus totaling $300,000 and a warrant received by
Endocare to acquire at that time approximately 57% of Sanarus common stock in
consideration for entering into a manufacturing supply and license agreement.
In the event Endocare were to exercise the warrant, the Company would then own a
majority equity position in Sanarus. As of December 31, 2000, the Company owns
less than 5% of the outstanding shares in Sanarus and the investment is
reflected at cost, which approximates fair market value, as it does not have
significant influence over the operations of Sanarus. The investment is
included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of
December 31, 1999 and 2000.
11.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Commitments
In February 1997, the Company signed a five-year lease for a 16,100 square foot
facility in Irvine, California. Rent expense on this lease was $153,860 in 1998 157,727 in 1999 and $161,754 in 2000. Future minimum commitments on this
operating lease are  $165,460 in 2001, and $34,639 in 2001.
The Company also leases other space and various office equipment under operating
leases, with lease commitments through 2003 totaling $17,686 in 2001, $6,809 in
2002, and $6,809 in 2003.
As of December 31, 2000, the Company has no other facility leases, capital
leases, or other long-term commitments. Contingencies
In March 2000, the Company filed patent infringement lawsuits against
Israeli-based Galil Medical, Ltd., and its U.S. affiliate, Galil Medical USA,
Inc. collectively, Galil. The suit against Galil filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Central District of California District Court, alleges that
Galil has marketed and sold cryosurgical systems that infringe Endocare
patented combination of cryocooling, ultrasound and temperature monitoring
technology. Endocare suit seek damages and injunctive relief with respect to
products and procedures which are found to infringe Endocare proprietary
technology. In August 2000, Galil submitted counterclaims alleging that the
Company cryosurgical probes infringe Galil probe patents. Galil seeks
unspecified damages and injunctive relief with respect to the Company
cryosurgical system. The Company believes it has adequate defenses to these
claims and intends to defend the litigation vigorously if necessary. All
proceedings in the action were stayed by the District Court on December 13, 2000
pending the outcome of the settlement discussions by the parties. The parties
are currently engaged in settlement discussions. Management does not expect any
material adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial condition or the
results of operations because of such actions.
In March 2000, the Company filed a similar suit to the one discussed above
against Cryomedical Sciences, Inc. CMSI. In December 2000, the parties
reached a settlement in this action. In the settlement agreement, CMSI
stipulated for purposes of the agreement that the Company patent combining
cryo-cooling, ultrasound and temperature monitoring technology is valid and
enforceable. On December 20, 2000, as part of the settlement, the District
Court signed a Consent Judgment validating the settlement agreement in which
CMSI stipulated for purposes of the agreement that the Endocare patent combining
cryo-cooling, ultrasound and temperature monitoring technology is valid and
enforceable. The settlement resulted in certain cross-licensing agreements.
The Company, in the normal course of business, is subject to various other legal
matters.  While the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with
certainty, the Company believes that the final outcome of these matters will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company consolidated results of
operations or financial condition.
From time to time, the Company has received other correspondence alleging
infringement of proprietary rights of third parties. No assurance can be given
that any relevant claims of third parties would not be upheld as valid and
enforceable, and therefore that the Company could be prevented from practicing
the subject matter claimed or would be required to obtain licenses from the
owners of any such proprietary rights to avoid infringement. Management does
not expect any material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition
or the results of operations because of such actions.
12.   MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company currently operates in one industry segment - the design, manufacture
and marketing of surgical devices and related procedures to treat prostate
diseases. The Company markets and sells its devices worldwide to distributors of
medical devices and directly to hospitals and other medical professional
organizations. Until the Company exercised its right to terminate the
distribution agreement with Boston Scientific in March 1999 see Note 10, the
Company Cryocare System was distributed exclusively by Boston Scientific for
urological applications.
Customer credit may be extended based upon evaluation of the customer
financial condition. The Company maintains reserves for credit losses, and
Company management considers such reserves to be adequate based upon historical
experience. International shipments are billed and collected by the Company in
U.S. dollars.
