50 44 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of BSQUARE Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
BSQUARE Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31,
2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005.
Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed
at a2. These financial statements and schedule
are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an
audit of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control
over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of BSQUARE Corporation and subsidiaries at
December31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2005, in conformity
with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

Description of Business and Accounting Policies   
Description of Business BSQUARE Corporation BSQUARE, a Washington corporation, and its
subsidiaries collectively, the Company provides software and
professional engineering services to the smart device
marketplace. A smart device is a dedicated purpose computing
device that typically has the ability to display information,
runs an operating system e.g.,
Microsoft
Windows
CE and may be connected to a network via a wired or wireless
connection. Examples of smart devices that BSQUARE targets
include set-top boxes, home gateways,
point-of-sale
terminals, kiosks, voting machines, gaming platforms, personal
digital assistants PDAs, personal media players and
smartphones. The Companys software and engineering services are focused
on devices running versions of the Microsoft Windows family of
operating systems, specifically Windows CE, Windows XP Embedded
and Windows
Mobiletm
for Pocket PC and Smartphone.   
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.   
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Estimates are used for, but not limited to, assessing the
collectibility of accounts receivable, the adequacy of the
allowance for doubtful accounts, the realization of deferred tax
assets and contingencies. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed
periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the
consolidated financial statements in the period they are
determined to be necessary.   
Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period, net of
shares subject to repurchase, and excludes any dilutive effects
of common stock equivalent shares, such as options and warrants
using the treasury stock method and convertible securities
using the if-converted method. Diluted earnings per share is
computed using the weighted average number of common and common
stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period; common
stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if
their effect is antidilutive.   
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits, money market
accounts and all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity
date at the time of purchase of three months or less.   
Restricted Cash Restricted cash represents deposits held at a financial
institution as security for an outstanding letter of credit
expiring through 2014 related to the Companys headquarters
lease obligation. 50 Table of Contents BSQUARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Short-term Investments The Companys short-term investments consist primarily of
investment-grade marketable securities, which are classified as
held-to-maturity and
recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Due
to the short-term nature of these investments, changes in market
interest rates would not have a significant impact on their fair
value.   
Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Risk The Company has the following financial instruments: cash and
cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The carrying value of
these instruments approximates fair value based on their
liquidity or short-term nature.   
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Companys accounts receivable balances are net of an
estimated allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial
condition and generally does not require collateral. The Company
estimates the collectibility of our accounts receivable and
records an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company
considers many factors when making this estimate, including
analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer
concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic
trends and changes in customer payment history when evaluating
the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Because the
allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate, it may be
necessary to adjust it if actual bad debt expense exceeds the
estimated reserve.   
Furniture, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements Furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over
estimated useful lives   
Computer equipment and system software
3 years   
Office furniture and equipment
3-5 years Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the
lease term or estimated useful lives. Maintenance and repairs
costs are expensed as incurred. When properties are retired or
otherwise disposed of, gains or losses are reflected in the
statement of operations. When facts and circumstances indicate
that the cost of long-lived assets may be impaired, an
evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the
carrying value of the asset to projected future cash flows. Upon
indication that the carrying value of such assets may not be
recoverable, the Company recognizes an impairment loss as a
charge against current operations based on the difference
between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value.   
Acquired Intangible Assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized and measured based on
fair value, which was computed by discounting the present value
of the estimated net cash flows at a rate of 20%. The Company
computes amortization on the straight-line method over the
assets estimated useful life, which the Company has
estimated to be two years. Intangible assets are periodically
reviewed for impairment in accordance with
SFASNo144, Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.   
Software Development Costs Under the criteria set forth in SFASNo86,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold,
Leased, or Otherwise Marketed, capitalization of software
development costs begins upon the establishment of technological
feasibility of the product, which the Company has defined as the 51 Table of Contents BSQUARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued completion of beta testing of a working product. The
establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing
assessment of the recoverability of these costs require
considerable judgment by management with respect to certain
external factors, including, but not limited to, anticipated
future revenue, estimated economic life and changes in software
and hardware technology. Amounts that could have been
capitalized under this statement after consideration of the
above factors were immaterial and, therefore, no software
development costs have been capitalized by the Company to date.   
Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.   
Advertising Costs All costs of advertising, including cooperative marketing
arrangements, are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was
$10,000 in 2005, $7,000 in 2004 and $5,000 in 2003.   
Stock-Based Compensation The Company follows Accounting Principles Board
APBOpinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and related interpretations, in
accounting for employee stock options rather than the
alternative fair value accounting allowed by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFASNo. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under APB
No25, compensation expense related to the Companys
employee stock options is measured based on the intrinsic value
of the stock option. SFASNo123, amended by
SFASNo148 Accounting for
Stock-Based-Compensation Transition and
Disclosure, requires companies that continue to follow APB
No25 to provide pro forma disclosure of the impact of
applying the fair value method of SFASNo123. The
Company recognizes compensation expense for options granted to
non-employees in accordance with the provisions of
SFASNo123 and the Emerging Issues Task Force
EITFconsensus Issue 96-18, Accounting for Equity
Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for
Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or
Services, which require using a fair value option pricing
model and re-measuring such stock options to the current fair
market value at each reporting period as the underlying options
vest. Deferred stock-based compensation consists of amounts recorded
when the exercise price of an option is lower than the fair
value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.
Deferred stock-based compensation is amortized in accordance
with Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASBInterpretation No28, on a graded vesting
basis, over the vesting period of the underlying option. Pro forma information regarding net loss is required by
SFASNo123 and SFASNo148 as if the
Company had accounted for its employee stock options under the
fair value method. The fair value of the Companys options
was estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, with the following
weighted average assumptions

Income Taxes The Company computes income taxes using the asset and liability
method, under which deferred income taxes are provided for on
the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis
and the tax basis of the Companys assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently
enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is established
when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts
expected to be realized.   
Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is the local
currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated
into U.S.dollars at exchange rates in effect at the
balance sheet date and revenue and expense accounts at the
average exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation
adjustments are included in Accumulated other
comprehensive loss, a separate component of
shareholders equity. The net gains and losses resulting
from foreign currency transactions are recorded in the period
incurred and were not significant for any of the periods
presented.   
Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from software and engineering
service sales when the following four revenue recognition
criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the
selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is
reasonably assured. Contracts and customer purchase orders are
generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.
Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are
used to verify delivery. The Company assesses whether the
selling price is fixed or determinable based on the contract and
payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the
sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. The Company
assesses collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness
of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as
well as the customers payment history. The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment provided that no
significant obligations remain on its part. The Company also
enters into arrangements in which a customer purchases a
combination of 53 Table of Contents BSQUARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued software licenses, professional engineering services and/or
post-contract customer support or maintenance PCS. As a
result, significant contract interpretation is sometimes
required to determine the appropriate accounting, including how
the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements if
there are multiple elements, whether undelivered elements are
essential to the functionality of delivered elements, and when
to recognize revenue. PCS includes rights to upgrades, when and
if available, telephone support, updates, and enhancements. When
vendor specific objective evidence VSOEof fair value
exists for all elements in a multiple element arrangement,
revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair
value of each of the elements. VSOE of fair value is established
by the price charged when the same element is sold separately.
Accordingly, the judgments involved in assessing VSOE have an
impact on the recognition of revenue in each period. Changes in
the allocation of the sales price between deliverables might
impact the timing of revenue recognition but would not change
the total revenue recognized on the contract. When elements such as software and professional engineering
services are contained in a single arrangement, or in related
arrangements with the same customer, the Company allocates
revenue to each element based on its relative fair value,
provided that such element meets the criteria for treatment as a
separate unit of accounting. In the absence of fair value for a
delivered element, the Company allocates revenue first to the
fair value of the undelivered elements and allocates the
residual revenue to the delivered elements. In the absence of
determinable fair value for an undelivered element, the
arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting,
resulting in a delay of revenue recognition for the delivered
elements until the undelivered elements for which there is no
determinable fair value are fulfilled. As a result, contract
interpretations and assessments of fair value are sometimes
required to determine the appropriate accounting. Service revenue from fixed-priced contracts is recognized using
the percentage of completion method. Percentage of completion is
measured based primarily on input measures such as hours
incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete,
with consideration given to output measures, such as contract
milestones, when applicable. The Company relies on estimates of
total expected hours as a measure of performance and cost in
order to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized.
Revisions to hour and cost estimates are recorded in the period
the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Losses on
fixed-priced contracts are recognized in the period when they
become known. Service revenue from time and materials contracts
and training services is recognized as services are performed. The Company records OEM licensing revenue, primarily royalties,
when OEM partners ship products incorporating its software, if
collection of such revenue is deemed probable. Deferred revenue includes deposits received from customers for
service contracts and unamortized service contract revenue,
customer advances under OEM licensing agreements and maintenance
revenue. In instances where final acceptance of the software,
services or hardware is specified by the customer, revenue is
deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met.   
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASBissued SFASNo123 revised 2004,
Share-Based Payment SFASNo123R, which
replaces SFASNo123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation SFASNo123 and
supersedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees. SFASNo123R requires all
share-based payments to employees, including employee stock
options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on
their fair values beginning January1, 2006 for calendar
year companies. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted
under SFASNo123 no longer will be an alternative to
financial statement recognition. The Company is required to
adopt Statement No123R beginning January1, 2006.
Under SFASNo123R, the Company 54 Table of Contents BSQUARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for
valuing share-based payments, the amortization method for
compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date
of adoption. The two transition methods include a modified prospective and a
modified retrospective adoption option. The modified prospective
adoption method requires that compensation expense be recorded
for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning
with the first quarter of adoption of SFASNo123R.
The modified retrospective adoption method requires that
compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options
and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated.
Under the modified retrospective method, prior periods may be
restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or
for all periods presented. The Company expects that the adoption of SFASNo123R
will have a material impact on its consolidated results of
operations and earnings per share. Effective January1,
2006, the Company will adopt the fair value recognition
provisions of SFASNo123R, using the modified
prospective transition method. Under that transition method,
compensation expense that the Company recognizes beginning on
that date will include: acompensation expense for all
share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of,
January1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
SFASNo123, and bcompensation expense for
all share-based payments granted on or after January1,
2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance
with the provisions of SFASNo123R. Results for
prior periods will not be restated. The Company has completed a
preliminary evaluation of the impact of adopting SFAS
No123R and estimate that it will result in share-based
payment expense between $600,000 and $800,000 for the year
ending December31, 2006. The actual effects of adopting
SFAS No123R will be dependent on numerous factors
including, but not limited to, actual option grant activity
during the year ending December31, 2006, the market value
of its common stock on the date future options are granted, and
the assumed award forfeiture rate. As a result, stock-based
compensation charges may differ significantly from the current
estimates. In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the
EITF on Issue No05-6, Determining the Amortization
Period for Leasehold Improvements
Issue05-6.
Issue05-6
provides that the amortization period for the leasehold
improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased
after the inception of a lease be the shorter of: athe
useful life of the assets or ba term that includes
required lease periods and renewals that are reasonably assured
upon the acquisition or the purchase. The provisions of
Issue05-6 are
effective on a prospective basis for leasehold improvements
purchased or acquired beginning in the first quarter of fiscal
2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of
Issue05-6 will
have a material effect on its financial position or results of
operations. In November 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position Nos.
FAS115-1 and FAS124-1, The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments FAS115-1 and
FAS124-1. FAS115-1 and FAS124-1
address determining when an investment is considered impaired
and whether that impairment is other than temporary, and
measuring impairment loss as well as addressing the accounting
after an entity recognized an other-than-temporary impairment.
Certain disclosures about unrealized losses that the entity did
not recognize as other-than-temporary impairments are also
addressed. FAS115-1 and FAS124-1 are effective
beginning the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Although the Company
will continue to monitor the application of FAS115-1 and
FAS124-1, the Company does not expect the adoption of
FAS115-1 and FAS124-1 will have a material effect on
its financial position or results of operations.

Asset Purchase On June30, 2005, the Company entered into an Asset
Purchase Agreement with Vibren Technologies, Inc. Vibren. The
Company purchased certain assets of Vibren in exchange for
$500,000 in cash and the assumption of certain obligations of
Vibren. The Company incurred related transaction costs of
$26,000, primarily legal fees. The transaction provided the
Company access to four software products that enhanced its
proprietary products portfolio and access to a broadened
customer base. 56 Table of Contents BSQUARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The Company has provided a full valuation allowance on deferred
tax assets during 2005, 2004 and 2003 because of the uncertainty
regarding their realizability. The valuation allowance increased
$360,000 in 2005, $32million in 2004, and $411,000 in
2003. At December31, 2005, the Company had approximately
$664million of net operating loss carryforwards and
$22million of tax credit carryforwards, which begin to
expire in 2021. In addition, the Company has $82million
of capital loss carryforwards, which expire in 2008. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2005, the Company became
aware that certain amounts remitted from its Taiwan subsidiary
might be subject to withholding tax at 20% of the amount
remitted. The Company is currently applying for withholding
exemptions from the Taiwan government on all significant
contracts, which would eliminate any withholding on amounts
remitted, including amounts already remitted. Such exemptions
are applied for with respect to each individual customer
contract and require that the Company submits certain
documentation to the Taiwan authorities. In reviewing the Taiwan
tax regulations and in consultation with tax advisors, the
Company believes that it will be granted such exemptions and, in
fact, received all but three withholding exemption approvals
from the Taiwan tax authority. However, there is no assurance
that exemptions will be granted covering the remaining customer
contracts for which it is seeking exemption. If the Company does
not receive the remaining exemptions, it could be obligated to
pay an aggregate of $261,000 in withholding tax, plus related
interest and penalties. Management is currently evaluating
alternative tax planning strategies to minimize corporate income
and withholding tax obligations in connection with its Taiwan
subsidiary.

Commitments and Contingencies   
Contractual Commitments The Companys principal commitments consist of obligations
outstanding under operating leases, which expire through 2014.
The Company has lease commitments for office space in Bellevue,
Washington; SanDiego, California; and Taipei, Taiwan. The
company leases office space in Akron, Ohio on a
month-to-month basis. In February 2004, the Company signed an amendment to the lease
for its then corporate headquarters and simultaneously entered
into a ten-year lease for a new corporate headquarters, also
located in Bellevue, Washington. The amendment to the former
headquarters lease, which was scheduled to terminate on
December31, 2004, provided that no cash lease payments
were to be made for the remainder of that lease term. Similarly,
the new corporate headquarters lease also provided that no cash
lease payments were to be made during 2004. However, in the
event the Company was to default under its new corporate 58 Table of Contents BSQUARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued headquarters lease, the landlord has the ability to demand
payment for cash payments forgiven in 2004 under the former
headquarters lease. The amount of the forgiven payments that the
landlord has the ability to demand repayment for decreases on
the straight-line basis over the length of the new ten-year
headquarters lease. Cash payments for which the landlord has the
ability to demand repayment for were $21million at
December31, 2005. The lease agreement for the new
corporate headquarters contains a lease escalation clause
calling for increased rents during the second half of the
ten-year lease. Rent expense was $839,000 in 2005, $472,000 in 2004 and
$26million in 2003. As of December31, 2005, the Company had $12million
pledged as collateral for a bank letter of credit under the
terms of its headquarters facility lease. The pledged cash
supporting the outstanding letter of credit is recorded as
restricted cash. Contractual commitments at December31, 2005 were as

Legal Proceedings   
IPO Litigation In Summer and early Fall 2001, four purported shareholder class
action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York against the Company,
certain of its current and former officers and directors the
Individual Defendants, and the underwriters of its
initial public offering. The suits purport to be class actions
filed on behalf of purchasers of the Companys common stock
during the period from October19, 1999 to December6,
2000. The complaints against the Company have been consolidated
into a single action and a Consolidated Amended Complaint, which
was filed on April19, 2002 and is now the operative
complaint. The plaintiffs allege that the underwriter defendants agreed to
allocate stock in the Companys initial public offering to
certain investors in exchange for excessive and undisclosed
commissions and agreements by those investors to make additional
purchases of stock in the aftermarket at pre-determined prices.
Plaintiffs allege that the prospectus for the Companys
initial public offering was false and misleading in violation of
the securities laws because it did not disclose these
arrangements. The action seeks damages in an unspecified amount. The action is being coordinated with approximately 300 other
nearly identical actions filed against other companies. On
July15, 2002, the Company moved to dismiss all claims
against it and the Individual Defendants. On October9,
2002, the Court dismissed the Individual Defendants from the
case without prejudice based upon Stipulations of Dismissal
filed by the plaintiffs and the Individual Defendants. On
February19, 2003, the Court denied the motion to dismiss
the complaint against the Company. On October13, 2004, the
Court certified a class in six of the approximately 300 other
nearly identical actions and noted that the decision is intended
to provide strong guidance to all parties regarding class
certification in the remaining cases. Plaintiffs have not yet
moved to certify a class in the Companys case. The 59 Table of Contents BSQUARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Company has approved a settlement agreement and related
agreements which set forth the terms of a settlement between the
Company, the Individual Defendants, the plaintiff class and the
vast majority of the other approximately 300 issuer defendants.
Among other provisions, the settlement provides for a release of
the Company and the Individual Defendants for the conduct
alleged in the action to be wrongful. The Company would agree to
undertake certain responsibilities, including agreeing to assign
away, not assert, or release certain potential claims the
Company may have against its underwriters. The settlement
agreement also provides a guaranteed recovery of $1billion
to plaintiffs for the cases relating to all of the approximately
300 issuers. To the extent that the underwriter defendants
settle all of the cases for at least $1billion, no payment
will be required under the issuers settlement agreement.
To the extent that the underwriter defendants settle for less
than $1billion, the issuers are required to make up the
difference. It is anticipated that any potential financial
obligation of the Company to plaintiffs pursuant to the terms of
the settlement agreement and related agreements will be covered
by existing insurance. The Company currently is not aware of any
material limitations on the expected recovery of any potential
financial obligation to plaintiffs from its insurance carriers.
Its carriers are solvent, and the company is not aware of any
uncertainties as to the legal sufficiency of an insurance claim
with respect to any recovery by plaintiffs. Therefore, we do not
expect that the settlement will involve any payment by the
Company. If material limitations on the expected recovery of any
potential financial obligation to the plaintiffs from the
Companys insurance carriers should arise, the
Companys maximum financial obligation to plaintiffs
pursuant to the settlement agreement would be less than
$34million. On February15, 2005, the court granted
preliminary approval of the settlement agreement, subject to
certain modifications consistent with its opinion. Those
modifications have been made. There is no assurance that the
court will grant final approval to the settlement. If the
settlement agreement is not approved and the Company is found
liable, the Company is unable to estimate or predict the
potential damages that might be awarded, whether such damages
would be greater than the Companys insurance coverage, and
whether such damages would have a material impact on its results
of operations or financial condition in any future period.   
Customer Litigation The Company is currently in dispute with a former customer
regarding payment of amounts due for a contract under which the
Company provided professional engineering services. The Company
recognized service revenue of $615,000 from this former customer
during the six months ended June30, 2005 and zero for the
remainder of the year. The Company has an account receivable
outstanding with this former customer of $475,000 as of
December31, 2005 and increased the allowance for doubtful
accounts by $475,000 in the fourth quarter of 2005. As required
under the contract, the parties engaged in a mediation
proceeding on October6, 2005 in an attempt to resolve the
dispute. The parties were unable to reach a resolution during
the mediation, and the Company filed a Complaint for breach of
contract and misappropriation of intellectual property against
the former customer on December22, 2005 in federal
district court in the state of Delaware. The Company has asked
for an award of damages of approximately $475,000, plus interest
and attorneys fees and related costs, and the Company has
reserved the right to request an injunction against the former
customer for misappropriation of intellectual property. On
January27, 2006, the former customer filed an Answer and
Counterclaim against the Company, denying the Companys
claims and alleging breach of contract, tortious interference
with the former customers business and fraud in the
inducement of the underlying contract. The former customer has
asked for an award of damages that includes a refund of all
payments made by them prior to the former customers breach
for non-payment approximately $280,000, lost profits, costs
incurred by the former customer to complete the project, any
reduction in the value of the former customers goodwill,
and attorneys fees and costs. The Company believes that it
has fulfilled all of its contractual obligations under the
services contract, that it is entitled to collect all amounts
due under the contract, plus attorneys fees and costs, and
that it will successfully defend the counterclaims against it.
However, there can be no assurance that the court will
ultimately rule in the Companys favor, and it may, in
fact, rule in favor of the former customer. 60 Table of Contents BSQUARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Further, the legal proceedings could result in the incurrence of
significant legal and related expenses, which may not be
recoverable depending on the outcome of the litigation. A ruling
in favor of the former customer, and/or the inability of the
Company to recover its expenses could adversely affect the
Companys operating results.

Shareholders Equity   
Reverse Stock Split On October5, 2005, the Board of Directors approved an
amendment to the Companys articles of incorporation to
reduce the Companys number of authorized shares of common
stock from 150,000,000 to 37,500,000 and also approved a
one-for-four reverse stock split of the Companys
outstanding common stock. The reverse stock split was effective
with respect to shareholders of record at the close of trading
on October6, 2005, and the Companys common stock
began trading as adjusted for the reverse stock split on
October7, 2005. As a result of the reverse stock split,
each four shares of common stock were exchanged for one share of
common stock and the total number of shares outstanding were
reduced from approximately 382million shares to
approximately 95million shares. The Company has
retroactively adjusted all share information to reflect the
reverse stock split in the accompanying financial statements and
footnotes.   
Common Stock Reserved for Future Issuance At December31, 2005, the Company had the following shares

Warrants In June 2003, as a result of a facilities restructuring
settlement agreement, the Company issued warrants to purchase up
to 100,000shares of the Companys common stock at an
exercise price of $456per share. The warrants were fully
vested at the time of issuance and expire in June 2008. The
warrants value was estimated at $332,000 using the
Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with an expected
dividend yield of 00%, a risk-free interest rate of 15 volatility of 180% and a contractual life of five years.   
Stock Options In May 1997, the Company adopted the Amended and Restated Stock
Option Plan the Amended Plan. Under the Amended Plan, the
Board of Directors may grant non-qualified stock options at a
price determined by the Board, not to be less than 85% of the
fair market value of the common stock. These options have a term
of up to 10years and vest over a schedule determined by
the Board of Directors, generally four years. Incentive stock
options granted under this program may only be granted to
employees and directors of the Company, have a term of up to
10years, and shall be granted at a price equal to the fair
market value of the Companys stock. The Amended Plan was
amended in 2003 to allow for an automatic annual increase in the
number of shares reserved for issuance during each of the
Companys fiscal years by an amount equal to the lesser of
ifour percent of the Companys outstanding shares
at the end of the previous fiscal year, iian amount
determined by the Companys Board of Directors, or 61 Table of Contents BSQUARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued iii375,000shares. The Amended Plan was further
amended in 2005 to allow for awards of stock appreciation rights
and restricted and unrestricted stock. In July 2000, the Company adopted the 2000 Non-Qualified Stock
Option Plan the 2000 Plan. Under the 2000 Plan, the Board of
Directors may grant non-qualified stock options at a price
determined by the Board. These stock options have a term of up
to 10years and vest over a schedule determined by the
Board of Directors, generally over four years. A summary of all stock option activity follows

During 2003 the Company made significant progress in its efforts
to mitigate excess facility commitments. The most significant
mitigation was the restructuring of its corporate headquarters
lease, which began with the signing of a Rent Deferral Agreement
with the landlord of its corporate headquarters in December
2003. Subsequently, in February 2004, the Company signed an
amendment to the lease for its then current corporate
headquarters and simultaneously entered into a ten-year lease
for a new corporate headquarters, also located in Bellevue,
Washington. The amendment of the then current headquarters
lease, which was scheduled to terminate on December31,
2004, provided that no cash lease payments were to be made for
the remainder of the lease term. Similarly, the new corporate
headquarters lease also provided that no cash payments were to
be made during 2004. In previous quarters, the Company had
recognized a restructuring charge for early lease termination
fees and lease payments for excess space associated with its
then corporate headquarters lease. As a result of these
agreements, the associated remaining liability of $970,000,
related to excess facilities, was reversed in the fourth quarter
of 2003. At December31, 2004, there were no remaining
early lease termination fee obligations. In June 2003, the Company negotiated a termination of its
Sunnyvale, California facility lease. This lease termination
resulted in accelerated cash payments of approximately $698,000
in the second quarter of 2003 and the issuance of a warrant to
purchase up to 100,000shares of the Companys common
stock at a price of $456per share. The warrant value was
estimated at $332,000 using the Black-Scholes-Merton option
pricing model with an expected dividend yield of 00%, a
risk-free interest rate of 15%, volatility of 180% and an
contractual life of five years. During the third quarter of
2003, the Company finalized negotiations for the termination of
its SanDiego, California facility lease, resulting in
accelerated cash payments of approximately $300,000 in July
2003. In addition, the Company agreed to enter into a new lease
with the landlord, at a reduced rate, for approximately
2,600square feet through January 2005. These arrangements
resulted in a decrease to the estimate of the Companys
obligation for future minimum lease payments of
$35million. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company decided to close its
Japan office. Consequently, the Company recognized a
restructuring charge of $412,000 in that quarter, of which
$86,000 related to severance for all remaining employees 42,000 was associated with remaining lease payments on the
excess facility, $140,000 related to the impairment of fixed
assets, and $144,000 was for other related charges. In addition to the reductions in its Japan office, the Company
announced two company-wide reductions in workforce of 30
employees, approximately 15% of its remaining workforce. In
connection 65 Table of Contents BSQUARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued with these headcount reductions, the Company paid approximately
$375,000 in severance and other benefits in 2003.

Controls and Procedures. We carried out an evaluation required by the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, under the supervision and with the participation of
our senior management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on
this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in
Rules13a-15e
and 15d-15e under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are effective in timely
alerting them to material information required to be included in
our periodic SEC reports. There has been no change in our internal control over financial
reporting during our fourth fiscal quarter of 2005 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
