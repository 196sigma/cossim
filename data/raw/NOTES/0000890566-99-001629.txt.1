REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Billing Concepts Corp.    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Billing
Concepts Corp. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of September 30,
1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September
30, 1999. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Billing Concepts Corp. and
subsidiaries as of September 30, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
September 30, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                   /s/ ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

BILLING CONCEPTS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 1999, 1998 AND 1997
NOTE 1. BUSINESS ACTIVITY
Billing Concepts Corp. BCC, formerly known as Billing Information
Concepts Corp., was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1996. BCC was
previously a wholly owned subsidiary of U.S. Long Distance Corp. USLD that,
upon its spin-off from USLD, became an independent, publicly held company. BCC
and its subsidiaries collectively, the Company provide billing clearinghouse
and information management services Local Exchange Carrier LEC billing
services in the United States to the telecommunications industry. Through its
subsidiary, Aptis, Inc. Aptis, the Company develops, licenses and supports
convergent billing systems for telecommunications and Internet service providers
and provides direct billing outsourcing services. The Company also provides
Internet-based automated loan approval products to the financial services
industries and is developing an Internet-based financial services website
focused on the credit union industry and its members.
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
BCC and its wholly and majority owned subsidiaries. The Company 24% investment
in the capital stock of Princeton eCom Corporation PTC see Note 5 is
accounted for using the equity method of accounting. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes.
ESTIMATES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES
The Company recognizes revenue from its LEC billing services when records
that are to be billed and collected by the Company are processed. Revenue from
the sale of convergent billing systems, including the licensing of software
rights, is recognized at the time the product is delivered to the customer,
provided that the Company has no significant related obligations or collection
uncertainties remaining. If there are significant obligations related to the
installation or development of the system delivered, revenue is recognized in
the period that the Company fulfills its obligations. Services revenue related
to the Company software operations is recognized in the period that the
services are provided. The Company recorded bad debt expense of $1,774,000 292,000, and $166,000 and recorded bad debt write-offs of $486,000, $56,000,
and $28,000 to its allowance for doubtful accounts for 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.
LEC BILLING SERVICES
The Company provides LEC billing services to telecommunications services
providers through billing agreements with the local telephone carriers, which
maintain the critical database of end-user names and addresses of the billed
parties. Bills are generated by the local telephone carriers and the collected
funds are remitted to the Company, which in turn remits these funds, net of
fees, to its billing customers. The Company records a trade accounts receivable
and operating revenue for fees charged for its billing services. When the
customer receivables are collected by the Company from the local telephone
carriers, the Company trade receivables are reduced by the amount
corresponding to the Company processing fees and the remaining funds are
recorded as an accounts payable to billing customers.
34
SOFTWARE SERVICES
Through its subsidiary, Aptis, the Company develops, licenses and supports
convergent billing systems for telecommunications and Internet service providers
and provides direct billing outsourcing services. In addition to license and
maintenance fees charged by the Company for the use of its billing software
applications, fees are also charged on a time and materials basis for software
customization and professional services. Processing fees for direct billing
services provided through the Company service bureau are assessed to customers
based on volume. Aptis revenues also include retail sales of computer hardware
and third-party software.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization
are computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
related assets, which range from three to ten years. Upon disposition, the cost
and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the
accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in other income expense
for that period. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense
as incurred, and major improvements are capitalized.
OTHER ASSETS
Other assets include costs incurred to acquire billing agreements with
local telephone companies for billing and collection services and other
agreements. These costs are being amortized over five to seven years. Other
assets also include financing costs related to the issuance of debt, which have
been deferred and are amortized over the life of the respective financing
agreement, and goodwill and other intangibles related to the acquisition of a
software development company see Note 5. In addition, long-term deposits have
been included in other assets.
ACCRUED LIABILITIES
Accrued liabilities include sales taxes payable on behalf of billing
customers of $17,952,000 and $18,866,000 at September 30, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
The Company self-insures its medical coverage for employees and dependents
up to $40,000 per covered individual and an aggregate annual maximum of $10
million. The Company accrues for known claims and an estimate of claims incurred
but not reported up to the maximum anticipated cost to the Company. During 1999
and 1998, the Company recognized approximately $10 million and $420,000,
respectively, in self-insurance expense. The Company insurer will pay
cumulative claims above the attachment limit up to $960,000 lifetime per covered
individual. The Company does not believe that claims reported and claims
incurred but not reported will exceed the amounts to be covered by the insurer.
COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND
On January 9, 1998, the Company announced that its Board of Directors
declared a one-for-one common stock dividend. The dividend was distributed on
January 30, 1998 to stockholders of record on January 20, 1998. No additional
proceeds were received on the dividend date and all costs associated with the
share dividend were capitalized as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.
All share and per share information in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements has been adjusted to give retroactive effect to the stock dividend.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The estimated fair values of the Company cash and cash equivalents and
all other financial instruments have been determined using appropriate valuation
methodologies and approximate their related carrying values.
35
INCOME TAXES
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on enacted income
tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the period in which the deferred
tax asset or liability is expected to be settled or realized. A change in the
tax laws or rates results in adjustments to the deferred tax assets or
liabilities. The effects of such adjustments are required to be included in
income in the period in which the tax laws or rates are changed.
NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
Earnings per share for all periods have been restated to reflect the
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128,
Earnings Per Share, which established standards for computing and presenting
earnings per share EPS for entities with publicly held common stock or
potential common stock. SFAS No. 128 requires dual presentation of basic and
diluted EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex
capital structures. Basic EPS were computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS differs from basic EPS due to the assumed conversions of potentially
dilutive options and warrants that were outstanding during the period. The
effects of potentially dilutive securities are excluded in periods in which a
loss is reported because their inclusion would be antidilutive. The following is
a reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the basic and diluted
per share computations for net income                                             FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1999

Certain options to purchase 5,534,834 shares of common stock at prices
ranging from $571 to $2900 per share were outstanding for a portion of 1999.
Certain options to purchase 2,591,500 shares of common stock at prices ranging
from $1300 to $2900 per share were outstanding for a portion of 1998. These
options were not included in the computation of the diluted EPS for 1999 and
1998, respectively, because the options' exercise price was greater than the
average market price of the common shares.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information, which establishes standards for reporting information about
operating segments in annual and interim financial statements. It also
establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services,
geographic areas and major customers. SFAS No. 131 supersedes SFAS No. 14,

The Company had various fixed rate term notes with rates ranging from 55%
to 80% due in varying amounts through August 2003. The loans were repaid in
full during the year ended September 30, 1999.
In December 1996, the Company obtained a $500 million revolving line of
credit facility with certain lenders primarily to draw upon to advance funds to
its billing customers prior to collection of the funds from the local telephone
companies. This credit facility was originally scheduled to terminate on
December 20, 1999, but has been extended until March 20, 2000 see Note 15.
Borrowings under the credit facility are limited to a portion of the Company
eligible receivables. No amounts were borrowed by the Company under its credit
facility at either September 30, 1999 or 1998. At September 30, 1999, the amount
available under the Company credit facility was $420 million.
Under the most restrictive terms of the Company credit agreements, the
Company is prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock, is required to
comply with certain financial covenants and is subject to certain limitations on
the issuance of additional secured debt. The Company was in compliance with all
such covenants at September 30, 1999.
NOTE 4. LEASES AND CHARTERS
The Company leases certain equipment and office space under operating
leases and leases a jet airplane under a charter agreement with a company
associated with an officer/director of the Company see Note 12. Rental expense

NOTE 5. ACQUISITIONS
Effective June 1, 1997, the Company acquired Computer Resources
Management, Inc. CRM, a company that develops software systems for the
direct billing of telecommunications services. This acquisition has been
accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, the results of operations for CRM have
been included in the Company consolidated financial statements, and the shares
related to the acquisition have been included in the weighted average shares
outstanding for purposes of calculating net income per common share since the
date of acquisition. The following unaudited pro forma information gives effect
to the acquisition of CRM as if it had occurred at the beginning of the period
presented. The unaudited pro forma information is based on the historical
information for the period presented and includes adjustments to reflect the
special charge resulting from expensing acquired in-process research and
development costs see Note 6 and the effect on depreciation and amortization
expense of recording the fair value of assets acquired. The number of weighted
average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the pro forma per share
data gives effect to the shares assumed to be issued had the acquisition
occurred at the beginning of the period presented.

The pro forma financial information should not be considered indicative of
the operating results that would have occurred had the acquisition actually
taken place at the beginning of the period specified or that the Company will
achieve in the future because, among other things, this information is based on
historical rather than prospective information and includes certain assumptions
which are subject to change. The unaudited pro forma financial information
reflects, in management opinion, all adjustments necessary to fairly state the
pro forma operating results for the period presented to make the unaudited pro
forma financial information not misleading.
An aggregate of $85 million cash and 650,000 shares of the Company
common stock were issued in connection with this purchase transaction. The
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired
was determined through an independent appraisal and amounted to approximately
$175 million, of which approximately $12 million was recorded as goodwill and
is being amortized on a straight-line basis over fifteen years. In addition 130 million was recorded as in-process research and development expenses see
Note 6. The remaining balance was recorded as the purchase price for a customer
list and other intangibles, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis
over periods ranging from six to twelve years.
In connection with the acquisition of CRM, the Company acquired certain
intangible assets including developed technology, customer relationships and
goodwill. In connection with this allocation, $130 million was expensed as a
charge for the purchase of in-process research and development. In performing
this allocation, the Company considered, among other factors, CRM technology
research and development projects in-process at the date of acquisition. With
regard to the in-process research and development projects, the Company
considered factors such as the stage of development of the technology at the
time of acquisition, the importance of each project to the overall development
plan, alternative future use of the technology and the projected incremental
cash flows from the projects when completed and any associated risks.
39
The purchased in-process research and development focused on next
generation products. The fair value assigned to these projects was $130
million. The research and development projects included: i java and internet
technologies, ii advanced provisioning systems; and iii local & convergent
billing systems. Due to its specialized nature, the in-process research and
development projects had no alternative future use, either for re-deployment
elsewhere in the business or in liquidation, in the event the project failed.
The Income Approach was the primary technique utilized in valuing the
purchased research and development. The valuation technique employed in the
appraisal was designed to properly reflect all intellectual property rights in
the intangible assets, including core technology. The value of the developed
technology was derived from direct sales of existing products, including their
contribution to in-process research and development. In this way, value was
properly attributed to the engineering know-how embedded in the existing product
that will be used in developmental products. The appraisal also considered the
fact that the existing know-how diminishes in value over time as new
technologies are developed and changes in market conditions render current
products and methodologies obsolete. The assumptions underlying the cash flow
projections used were derived primarily from investment banking reports,
historical results, company records and discussions with management.
Revenue estimates for each in-process project were developed by management
and based on an assessment of the industry. Cost of goods sold for each project
are expected to be in line with historical results. The Capital Asset Pricing
Model was used to determine the cost of capital discount rate for CRM
in-process projects. Due to the technological and economic risks associated with
the developmental projects, discount rates of 20% to 275% were used to discount
cash flows from the in-process products. The Company believes that the foregoing
assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the
acquisition. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions
used to estimate sales, development costs or profitability, or the events
associated with such projects, will transpire as estimated. For these reasons,
actual results may vary from projected results. The most significant and
uncertain assumptions relating to the in-process projects relate to the
projected timing of completion and revenues attributable to each project.
In September 1998, the Company acquired 22% of the capital stock of PTC
for $10 million. PTC is a privately held company located in Princeton, New
Jersey specializing in electronic bill publishing over the Internet and advanced
payment solutions. Through September 1999, the Company has acquired additional
shares of PTC stock, increasing the Company ownership position to
approximately 24% at September 30, 1999. The Company accounts for this
investment under the equity method of accounting.
In connection with the acquisition of the 22% ownership position in PTC,
the Company acquired certain intangible assets, including developed technology,
customer relationships and goodwill. In connection with this allocation, $20
million was expensed as a charge for the purchase of in-process research and
development. In performing this allocation, the Company considered, among other
factors, PTC research and development projects in-process at the date of
acquisition. With regard to the in-process research and development projects,
the Company considered factors such as the stage of development of the
technology at the time of acquisition, the importance of each project to the
overall development plan, alternative future use of the technology and the

projected timing of completion and revenues attributable to each project.
In October 1998, the Company acquired Expansion Systems Corporation
ESC, a privately held company headquartered in Glendale, California that
develops and markets billing and registration systems to Internet Service
Providers ISPs under its flagship products TOTALBILL and INSTANTREG. An
aggregate of 170,000 shares of the Company common stock was issued in
connection with this transaction, which has been accounted for as a pooling of
interests combination. The consolidated financial statements for periods prior
to the combination have not been restated to include the accounts and results of
operations of ESC due to the transaction not having a significant impact on the
Company prior period financial position or results of operations as none of
ESC assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses or income loss exceeded 2% of
the Company consolidated respective amounts as of or for any of the three
years in the period ended September 30, 1998.
In December 1998, the Company completed the merger of Communications
Software Consultants, Inc. CommSoft in consideration of 2,492,759 shares of
the Company common stock. CommSoft was a privately held, international
software development and consulting firm specializing in the telecommunications
industry. The business combination has been accounted for as a pooling of
interests. The consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the
combination have been restated to include the accounts and results of operations
of CommSoft. The revenues and net income from CommSoft from October 1, 1998 to
the date of the merger were approximately $38 million and $04 million,
respectively.
In July 1999, the Company acquired a 60% equity interest in an Internet
company located in Austin, Texas that is developing an Internet-based financial
services website focused on the credit union industry and its members. The
accounts of this company have been included in the Company consolidated
financial statements since the date of acquisition. Subsequent to September 30,
1999, the Company acquired the remaining 40% of this company through a related
acquisition see Note 15.
NOTE 6. SPECIAL CHARGES
During the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company recognized
special charges in the amount of $15 million. These charges relate to
professional services expenses incurred in contemplation of a proposed
separation of the Company LEC Billing and Software businesses into two
separate public companies. The proposed separation was discontinued in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1999.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, the Company recognized special
charges in the amount of $20 million. The $20 million charge represented the
in-process research and development costs acquired in connection with the
acquisition of 22% of the capital stock of PTC see Note 5. At the date of
acquisition, the technological feasibility of the acquired technology had not
yet been established, and the technology had no future alternative uses.
41
During the third quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company recognized special
charges in the amount of $213 million. The $213 million charge included
in-process research and development costs of $130 million acquired in
connection with the acquisition of CRM see Note 5. At the date of acquisition,
the technological feasibility of the acquired technology had not yet been
established, and the technology had no future alternative uses. The remaining
$83 million charge represented accumulated costs associated with the
development of a direct billing system for a service bureau operation.
This development was abandoned by the Company.
NOTE 7. SHARE CAPITAL
On July 10, 1996, the Company, upon authorization by its Board of
Directors, adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan Rights Plan and declared a
dividend of one preferred share purchase right on each share of its outstanding
common stock. The rights will become exercisable if a person or group acquires
15% or more of the Company common stock or announces a tender offer, the
consummation of which would result in ownership by a person or group of 15% or
more of the Company common stock. These rights, which expire on July 10, 2006,
entitle stockholders to buy one ten-thousandth of a share of a new series of
participating preferred shares at a purchase price of $130 per one
ten-thousandth of a preferred share. The Rights Plan was designed to ensure that
stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed
takeover of the Company.
No cash dividends were paid on the Company common stock during fiscal
1999, 1998 or 1997.
NOTE 8. STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS
The Company has adopted the BCC 1996 Employee Comprehensive Stock Plan
Comprehensive Plan and the BCC 1996 Non-Employee Director Plan Director
Plan under which officers and employees, and non-employee directors,
respectively, of the Company and its affiliates are eligible to receive stock
option grants. Employees of the Company also are eligible to receive restricted
stock grants under the Comprehensive Plan. The Company has reserved 14,500,000
and 1,300,000 shares of its common stock for issuance pursuant to the
Comprehensive Plan and Director Plan, respectively. Under each plan, options
vest and expire pursuant to individual award agreements; however, the expiration
date of unexercised options may not exceed ten years from the date of grant
under the Comprehensive Plan and five and seven years for automatic and
discretionary grants, respectively, under the Director Plan.

The Company has adopted SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, but has elected to apply Accounting Principles Board APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans as allowed under SFAS
No. 123. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized compensation expense for
stock options granted where the exercise price is equal to the market price of
the underlying stock at the date of the grant. During fiscal 1999, 1998 and
1997, the Company recognized $255,000, $726,000 and $540,000, respectively, of
compensation expense for options granted below the market price of the
underlying stock on such measurement date. In addition, in accordance with the
provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, the Company has not recognized compensation
expense for employee stock purchases under the Billing Concepts Corp. Employee
Stock Purchase Plan ESPP.
Had compensation expense for the Company stock options granted and ESPP
purchases in 1999, 1998 and 1997 been determined based on the fair value at the
grant dates consistent with the methodology of SFAS No. 123, pro forma net
income and net income per common share would have been as follows in thousands,

the year ended September 30, 1999, $229 and $1065 for the year ended September
30, 1998, and $355 and $1621 for the year ended September 30, 1997. The
weighted average fair value and weighted average exercise price of options
granted during the year ended September 30, 1997 where the exercise price was
below the market price of the underlying stock at the grant date were $448 and
$1300, respectively. For purposes of the pro forma disclosures, the estimated
fair value of options is amortized to pro forma compensation expense over the
options' vesting periods.

Warrants to purchase 201,252 and 175,354 shares of common stock were
exercised in fiscal 1998 and 1997, respectively. There were no warrants
exercised in fiscal 1999 and no warrants outstanding at September 30, 1999.

Retirement Plan is offered to eligible employees of the Company. Generally,
all employees of the Company who are 21 years of age or older and who have
completed six months of service during which they worked at least 500 hours were
eligible for participation in the Retirement Plan. The Retirement Plan is a
defined contribution plan which provides that participants generally may make
voluntary salary deferral contributions, on a pretax basis, of between 1% and
15% of their compensation in the form of voluntary payroll deductions up to a
maximum amount as indexed for cost-of-living adjustments. The Company makes
matching contributions as a percentage determined annually of the first 6% of a
participant compensation contributed as salary deferral. The Company may make
additional discretionary contributions. No discretionary contributions were made
in fiscal 1999, 1998 or 1997. During fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997, the Company
matching contributions totaled approximately $635,000, $392,000 and $186,000,
respectively.
The Billing Concepts Corp. Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, which
was established under the requirements of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, is offered to eligible employees of the Company. The
Company has reserved 2,000,000 shares of its common stock for issuance pursuant
to the ESPP. The ESPP enables employees who have completed at least six months
of continuous service with the Company to purchase shares of BCC common stock
at a 15% discount through voluntary payroll deductions. The purchase price is
the lesser of 85% of the closing price of the common stock on the opening date
of each participation period or 85% of the closing price of the common stock on
the ending date of each participation period. The Company issued 41,326 and
56,360 shares of its common stock in January and July 1999 pursuant to the ESPP
at purchase prices of $855 and $606, respectively. The Company issued 14,659
and 27,561 shares of its common stock in January and July 1998 pursuant to the
ESPP at purchase prices of $1599 and $1132, respectively. The Company issued
19,504 and 15,704 shares of its common stock in February and August 1997
pursuant to the ESPP at purchase prices of $903 and $1243, respectively.
NOTE 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
A lawsuit was filed on December 31, 1998, in the United States District
Court in San Antonio, Texas by an alleged stockholder of the Company against the
Company and various of its officers and directors, alleging unspecified damages
as a result of alleged false statements in various press releases prior to
November 19, 1998. In September 1999, the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Texas entered an order and judgment dismissing the plaintiff
lawsuit. The plaintiff noticed an appeal of that decision on September 29, 1999.
Although no assurances can be given, the Company believes it has meritorious
defenses to this action and intends to defend itself vigorously.                    45
The Company had a $10 million default judgment entered against it in
September 1999 as a result of a garnishment action in Wisconsin state court. The
Company was not alleged to have done anything wrong, and its liability is based
solely on a failure by former in-house counsel to timely answer the garnishment
lawsuit. The underlying judgment was against a former customer of the Company.
The class plaintiff attempt to collect that judgment through moneys held by
the Company on behalf of its former customer gave rise to the garnishment action
against the Company. The Company entered into a Stipulation of Settlement in
this matter which will require a minimum final settlement amount of $08
million. During 1999, the Company recorded a charge that it believes is adequate
for the final settlement.
The Company is cooperating with the Federal Trade Commission FTC
Bureau of Consumer Protection BCP regarding BCP staff requests for industry
and customer specific information from the Company relating primarily to the
alleged cramming of charges for non-regulated telecommunication services by
certain of its customers. Cramming is the addition of charges to a telephone
bill for programs, products or services the consumer did not knowingly
authorize. In connection with the Company responses to the ongoing
informational requests, the BCP staff has proposed a complaint against the
Company. The BCP staff alleges that it can impose a variety of civil remedies on
the Company, including consumer redress or other equitable relief as well as
restrictions on the way the Company processes charges for enhanced services. The
Company disputes the BCP staff alleged basis for liability and is reviewing
the BCP staff allegations to ensure that corrective action has already been
taken. Billing Concepts has and will continue to cooperate and engage the BCP
staff in good faith negotiations. The Company is unable to predict what action,
if any, the FTC will take regarding the BCP staff proposed complaint or what,
if any, financial impact would result.
The Company is involved in various other claims, legal actions and
regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company
believes it is unlikely that the final outcome of any of the claims, litigation
or proceedings to which the Company is a party, including those described above,
will have a material adverse effect on the Company financial position or
results of operations; however, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation,
there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or
proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on the Company results of
operations for the fiscal period in which such resolution occurs.
The Company is obligated to pay certain local telephone companies a total
of approximately $52 million, $34 million and $09 million during fiscal 2000,
2001 and 2002, respectively, for future minimum usage charges under billing and
collection agreements that, unless automatically renewed, expire at varying
dates through the end of fiscal 2002. The billing and collection agreements do
not provide for any penalties other than payment of the obligation should the
usage levels not be met. The Company has met all such volume commitments in the
past and anticipates exceeding the future minimum usage volumes with all of
these vendors.
NOTE 12. RELATED PARTIES
The Company and USLD shared a common individual on their respective boards
of directors through June 2, 1997. Therefore, USLD was considered a related
party for purposes of financial disclosure through this date. The Company
provided billing and information management services for USLD and purchased
telecommunications services from USLD. Transactions under the agreements for
these services have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements at market prices. Related party transactions between the Company and
USLD are summarized as follows                             YEAR ENDED

The Company charters a jet airplane from a company associated with an
officer/director of the Company. Under the terms of the charter agreement, the
Company is obligated to pay annual minimum fees of $500,000 over the five years
ending March 31, 2003 for such charter services. Such amounts have been included
in the future minimum operating lease and charter payments in Note 4. During the
years ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, the Company paid approximately $727,000
and $278,000, respectively, in fees related to this agreement.
During 1999, the Company entered into an agreement to guarantee the terms
of a lease of PTC see Note 5 for office space in Princeton, New Jersey. The
terms of the lease require aggregate payments of approximately $118 million
through December 2009. The Company does not believe it is probable that the
lease guarantee will be exercised.
