Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15f or 15d-15f promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys principal
executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company;  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management has designed its internal control over
financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Managements assessment included review and testing of both the design effectiveness and operating effectiveness of controls over all relevant assertions related to all significant accounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officers and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2009. BDO Seidman, LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm, which audited the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, has also issued an attestation on our
internal control over financial reporting, and their report is set forth on page 36.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Board of Directors and Shareholders Dril-Quip, Inc. Houston, Texas We have audited Dril-Quip, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Dril-Quip, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A.Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Dril-Quip, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Dril-Quip, Inc. as of December31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2009 and our report dated February25, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/BDO Seidman, LLP Houston, Texas February25, 2010

DRIL-QUIP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.Organization Dril-Quip, Inc., a Delaware corporation the
Company or Dril-Quip, designs, manufactures, sells and services highly engineered offshore drilling and production equipment that is well suited for use in deepwater, harsh environment and severe service applications. The
Companys principal products consist of subsea and surface wellheads, subsea and surface production trees, subsea control systems and manifolds, mudline hanger systems, specialty connectors and associated pipe, drilling and production riser
systems, liner hangers, wellhead connectors and diverters. Dril-Quips products are used by major integrated, large independent and foreign national oil and gas companies in offshore areas throughout the world. Dril-Quip also provides technical
advisory assistance on an as-requested basis during installation of its products, as well as rework and reconditioning services for customer-owned Dril-Quip products. In addition, Dril-Quips customers may rent or purchase running tools from
the Company for use in the installation and retrieval of its products. The Companys operations are organized into three
geographic segmentsWestern Hemisphere including North and South America; headquartered in Houston, Texas, Eastern Hemisphere including Europe and Africa; headquartered in Aberdeen, Scotland and Asia-Pacific including the Pacific Rim,
Southeast Asia, Australia, India and the Middle East; headquartered in Singapore. Each of these segments sells similar products and services and the Company has major manufacturing facilities in all three of its headquarter locations as well as
Macae, Brazil. The Companys major subsidiaries are Dril-Quip Europe Limited DQE, located in Aberdeen with branches in Denmark, Norway and Holland; Dril-Quip Asia Pacific PTE Ltd. DQAP, located in Singapore; Dril-Quip do Brasil LTDA
DQB, located in Macae, Brazil; and Dril-Quip Holdings Pty Ltd. DQH, located in Perth, Australia. Dril-Quip Nigeria Ltd. is located in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, and Dril-Quip Egypt for Petroleum Services S.A.E. is located in Alexandria, Egypt.
Both are wholly owned subsidiaries of DQE. Dril-Quip Oilfield Services Tianjin Co. Ltd. DQT is located in Tianjin, China. DQT is a wholly owned subsidiary of DQAP. 2. Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned.
All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America under
guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ASC requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of the Companys more significant estimates are
those affected by critical accounting policies for revenue recognition, inventories and contingent liabilities. Cash and
cash equivalents Short-term investments that have a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase are
classified as cash equivalents. The Company invests excess cash in interest bearing accounts, money market mutual funds and funds which invest in U.S. Treasury obligations and repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury obligations. The
Companys investment objectives continue to be the preservation of capital and the maintenance of liquidity. 
42 Table of Contents
Trade Receivables The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts on trade receivables equal to amounts estimated to be uncollectible. This estimate
is based upon historical collection experience combined with a specific review of each customers outstanding trade receivable balance. Management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate; however, actual write-offs may
exceed the recorded allowance. The following is a summary of activity relating to the allowance for doubtful accounts for the years ended December31, 2007, 2008 and 2009:  Inthousands Balance at December31, 2006 2,672 Charges to costs and expenses 978 Recoveries/write-offs 1,338 Balance at December31, 2007 2,312 Charges to costs and expenses 1,937 Recoveries/write-offs 742 Balance at December31, 2008 3,507 Charges to costs and expenses 1,333 Recoveries/write-offs 2,173 Balance at December31, 2009 2,667 Inventories Inventory costs are determined principally by the use of the first-in, first-out FIFO costing method and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory is valued principally using standard costs,
which are calculated based upon direct costs incurred and overhead allocations. Inventory purchased from third party vendors is principally valued at the weighted average cost. Periodically, obsolescence reviews are performed on slow-moving
inventories and reserves are established based on current assessments about future demands and market conditions. The inventory values have been reduced by a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories. Inventory reserves of $208 million and $242
million were recorded as of December31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. If market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory reserves may be required. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost, with depreciation provided on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets including property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If
the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, an impairment charge is recognized by reflecting the asset at its fair value. No impairment of long-lived assets existed at
December31, 2008 or 2009. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Current income taxes are provided on income reported for
financial statement purposes, adjusted for transactions that do not enter into the computation of income taxes payable in the same year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
43 Table of Contents
enacted tax rates for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Revenue
Recognition Product Revenue The Company earns product revenues from two sources:  product revenues recognized under the percentage-of-completion method; and  product revenues from the sale of products that do not qualify for the percentage-of-completion method. Revenues recognized under the percentage-of-completion method The Company uses the percentage-of-completion method on long-term project contracts pursuant to ASC Topic 605-35, which provides guidance on
accounting for the performance of contracts. Long-term project contracts have the following characteristics:  The contracts call for products which are designed to customer specifications;  The structural designs are unique and require significant engineering and manufacturing efforts generally requiring more than one year in duration;
The contracts contain specific terms as to milestones, progress billings and delivery dates; and  Product requirement cannot be filled directly from the Companys standard inventory. For each project, the Company prepares a detailed analysis of estimated costs, profit margin, completion date and risk factors which include
availability of material, production efficiencies and other factors that may impact the project. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the progress of each project, which may result in revisions of previous estimates, including revenue
recognition. The Company calculates the percent complete and applies the percentage to determine the revenues earned and the appropriate portion of total estimated costs. Losses, if any, are recorded in full in the period they first become evident.
Historically, the Companys estimates of total costs and costs to complete have approximated actual costs incurred to complete the project. Under the percentage-of-completion method, billings do not always correlate directly to the revenue recognized. Based upon the terms of the specific contract, billings may be in excess of the revenue
recognized, in which case the amounts are included in customer prepayments as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Likewise, revenue recognized may exceed customer billings in which case the amounts are reported in trade receivables.
Unbilled revenues are expected to be billed and collected within one year. As of December31, 2008 and 2009, receivables included $448 million and $248 million of unbilled receivables, respectively. For the year ended December31, 2009,
there were 17 projects representing approximately 13% of the Companys total revenues and approximately 16% of its product revenues that were accounted for using percentage-of-completion accounting as compared to 23 projects during 2008 which
represented 25% of the Companys total revenue and 30% of its product revenues. Revenues not recognized under the
percentage-of-completion method Revenues from the sale of inventory products, not accounted for under the
percentage-of-completion method, are recorded at the time the manufacturing processes are complete and ownership is transferred to the customer. 
44 Table of Contents
Service revenue The Company earns service revenues from three sources:  technical advisory assistance;  rental of running tools; and  rework and reconditioning of customer owned Dril-Quip products. The recognition of service revenue is the same for all products, including those accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method.
The Company does not install products for our customers, but it provides technical advisory assistance. At the time of delivery of the product, the customer is not obligated to buy or rent the Companys running tools and the Company is not
obligated to perform any subsequent services related to installation. Technical advisory assistance service revenue is recorded at the time the service is rendered. Service revenues associated with the rental of running and installation tools are
recorded as earned. Rework and reconditioning service revenues are recorded when the refurbishment process is complete. The
Company normally negotiates contracts for products, including those accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method, and services separately. For all product sales, it is the customers decision as to the timing of the product
installation as well as whether Dril-Quip running tools will be purchased or rented. Furthermore, the customer is under no obligation to utilize the Companys technical advisory services. The customer may use a third party or their own
personnel. Foreign Currency The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at period end exchange rates except for revenues and expenses, which are translated at average monthly rates. Translation
adjustments are reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity and have no current effect on earnings or cash flows. These adjustments amounted to an increase of $33 million in 2007, a decrease of $426 million in 2008 and an
increase of $207 million in 2009. The translation adjustment decrease in 2008 resulted primarily from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the British pound sterling and the Brazilian real during the latter half of 2008. The translation
adjustment increase in 2009 resulted primarily from the weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to the British pound sterling and the Brazilian real. Foreign currency exchange transactions are recorded using the exchange rate at the date of the settlement. Exchange gains losses were approximately $22 million in 2007, $15 million in 2008, and $34
million in 2009, net of income taxes. These amounts are included in selling, general and administrative costs in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial
instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables, and debt instruments. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their respective fair values as they are either short-term in nature or carry
interest rates that approximate market rates. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily include trade receivables. The Company grants
credit to its customers, which operate primarily in the oil and gas industry. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains reserves for
potential losses, and such losses have historically been within managements expectations. 
45 Table of Contents
In addition, the Company invests excess cash in interest bearing accounts, money market
mutual funds and funds which invest in obligations of the U.S. Treasury and repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury obligations. Changes in the financial markets and interest rates could affect the interest earned on short-term investments.
Comprehensive Income ASC Topic 220 establishes the rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components. The standard requires the Company to include unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency
translation adjustments in other comprehensive income. Generally, gains are attributed to a weakening U.S. dollar and losses are the result of a strengthening U.S. dollar. Interest Capitalization The Company capitalizes interest on significant construction projects for which interest costs are being incurred. These projects principally consist of construction or expansion of the Companys
facilities. No interest was capitalized in 2007, 2008 or 2009. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
year. Diluted earnings per share are computed considering the dilutive effect of stock options using the treasury stock method. New Accounting Standards In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update ASU 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements ASU 2009-13. The new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and
requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable based on the relative selling price. The selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE if available, third-party evidence
if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE or third-party evidence is available. ASU 2009-13 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after June15, 2010. The Company does not
expect that the provisions of the new guidance will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 105. This standard establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC as the single source of the authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied by
nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of the authoritative U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants. The ASC supersedes all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting
standards. Following the ASC, the FASB will not issue new standards in the form of statements, FASB staff positions or Emerging Issues Task Force. Instead, it will issue ASUs that serve to update the ASC, provide background information about
the guidance and provide the basis for conclusions on changes to the ASC. In June 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 825
regarding disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments for interim periods of publicly traded companies as well as in the annual financial statements. The standard also requires publicly traded companies to include disclosures about the
fair value of its financial instruments whenever it issues summarized financial information for interim reporting periods. The adoption of this standard had no material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In May 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 855 regarding subsequent events. This standard establishes general standards of accounting for
and disclosures of events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet
46 Table of Contents
date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. This standard sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity
should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its
financial statements, and the disclosure that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The standard requires entities to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated as
well as whether that date is the date the financial statements were issued or the date the financial statements were available to be issued. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the Companys disclosure on this
topic. In January 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 805 regarding business combinations. The standard establishes
principles and requirements for the recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities and goodwill including the requirement that most transaction costs and restructuring costs be expensed. In addition, the standard requires disclosures to enable
users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination that occurs either during the reporting period or after the reporting period but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. The adoption of
this standard had no material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In January 2009, the Company
adopted ASC Topic 810 regarding noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements. The standard established accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. The
adoption of this standard had no material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In January 2008,
the Company adopted ASC Topic820-10. In February 2008, ASC820-10-55 was issued. The standard provides a one year deferral of the effective date of ASC820-10 for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that
are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually. ASC820-10 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. ASC820-10 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements. The Company does not have any assets or liabilities that
would be recognized or disclosed on a fair value basis as of December31, 2008 or December31, 2009. 3. Inventories

credit of up to $10 million, terminated in accordance with its terms on September1, 2009. The Company is in the process of reviewing alternatives, including securing a new line of credit. Dril-Quip Europe Limited has a credit agreement with the Bank of Scotland dated March21, 2001 in the original amount of U.K. Pounds
Sterling 40million approximately U.S. $65 million at December31, 2009. Borrowing under this facility bears interest at the Bank of Scotland base rate, which was 050% at December31, 2009, plus 1%, and is repayable in 120 equal
monthly installments, plus interest. Substantially all of this facility
48 Table of Contents
was used to finance capital expenditures in Norway. The outstanding balance of this facility at December31, 2008 and 2009 was approximately U.S.$14million and
U.S.$865,000, respectively. The facility is secured by land and buildings in Aberdeen, Scotland and contains no restrictive financial covenants. Interest paid on long-term debt for the years ended December31, 2007, 2008 and 2009 was $253,000, $132,000 and $21,700 respectively. Scheduled maturities of long-term debt are as follows:
2010$723,000; 2011$274,000; 2012$36,000; 2013$6,000; and none thereafter. 6. Income Taxes In accordance with ASC 740-10, the Company is required to recognize in its financial statements the impact of a tax position that is more
likely than not to be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any appeals. The standard provides guidance on recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
periods, disclosure and transition. Based on the Companys evaluation, the Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Companys financial statements. The evaluation was
performed for the tax years which remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions as of December31, 2009, which are the years ended December31, 2004 through December31, 2009. The Company has occasionally been assessed
interest or penalties by major tax jurisdictions and these assessments historically have been minimal and immaterial to the Companys financial results. In accordance with the Companys accounting policy, both before and after adoption of
ASC Topic 740-10, interest expense assessed by tax jurisdictions is included with interest expense and assessed penalties are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Income before income taxes consisted of the following:  Year ended December31 2007

262 272 262 Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Based upon existing market conditions and the Companys earnings prospects, it is anticipated that all deferred tax assets will be realized in
future years. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:  December31 2008 2009 In thousands Deferred tax assets Deferred profit on intercompany sales 4,109 6,439 Inventory 2,504 5,489 Inventory reserve 4,790 5,210 Allowance for doubtful accounts 551 656 Reserve for accrued liabilities 378 1,420 Stock options 2,104 3,431 Other 1,398 1,897 Total deferred tax assets 15,834 24,542 Deferred tax liability Property, plant and equipment 6,524 7,220 Net deferred tax asset 9,310 17,322 Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely
reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal income taxes has been provided thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to both U.S. income taxes subject to an
adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practicable. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provides for a tax deduction for qualified production activities. Under the guidance of ASC Topic
740, Income Tax and the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the deduction will be treated as a special deduction and not as a reduction in the tax rate.
As such, the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing on the date of enactment. The Companys production activities qualify for the tax deduction and the Companys 2009 income tax provision includes
an estimated deduction of approximately $30 million. The Company paid $419 million, $405 million and $378 million in
income taxes in 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively.

foreign employees. The Company generally makes contributions to the plans equal to each participants eligible contributions for the plan year up to a specified percentage of the participants annual compensation. The Companys
contribution expense was $27million, $30million and $31million in 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. 9. Commitments
and Contingencies The Company leases certain office, shop and warehouse facilities, automobiles, and equipment. The
Company expenses all lease payments when incurred. Total lease expense incurred was $27million, $26million and $31million in 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Future annual minimum lease commitments, including required
leasehold improvements, at December31, 2009 are as follows: 2010$25million; 2011$181million; 2012$33million; 2013$02million; 2014$02million; and
thereafter$24million. In 2006, the Company entered into a contract in the amount of approximately $47 million
with MPF Corp. Ltd. MPF under which the Company was to construct risers and related equipment to be installed on an offshore drill ship being constructed for MPF. MPF and its affiliates filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case in September
2008 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division Case No08-36084. Under the Bankruptcy Code, at some point MPF must either assume this contract or reject it. Since MPF is not required to make a
decision on the handling of the contract immediately, the Company cannot be sure as to when its rights under the contract will be clarified. Currently, the Company has possession of all the raw materials purchased to date and work-in-progress under
the contract. At the time of the bankruptcy filing, the Company had recognized approximately $20 million in revenues under the contract and had received payments of approximately $16 million. No further revenue has been recognized since the second
quarter of 2008. The Company believes the remaining $4 million of unpaid receivables will be realized through the workings of the contract or through its interest in the partially constructed inventory. While the Company has made filings in the
bankruptcy proceedings that it believes are appropriate to protect its rights, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to receive the expected benefits of the contract with MPF. While the Company does not expect the outcome of this
matter to have a material adverse effect on the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows, the Company may be required to write down or forfeit some portion of the revenues recognized to date if it becomes probable that the Company
will not receive such funds or realize the value of the inventory in its possession. In August 2007, the Companys
Brazilian subsidiary was served with assessments collectively valued at approximately BRL233 million approximately U.S. $126 million as of February 2010 from the State of
51 Table of Contents
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to collect a state tax on the importation of goods. The Company believes that its subsidiary is not liable for the taxes and is vigorously contesting the assessments in
the Brazilian administrative and judicial systems. At this time, the ultimate disposition of this matter cannot be determined and therefore, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount of loss or the range of possible losses that might
result from an adverse judgment or settlement of these assessments. Accordingly, no liability has been accrued in conjunction with this matter. The Company does not expect the liability, if any, resulting from these assessments to have a material
adverse effect on its operations, financial position or cash flows. While pending, the amount of interest, penalties and monetary restatement fees on the tax assessments continues to accrue and totaled as of February2010 approximately BRL354
million approximately U.S. $191 million. In November 2007, the Company entered into a lease agreement in Singapore for
approximately 11 acres of vacant land. The lease term is 30 years and the Company elected to make a lump sum payment for the entire lease. In addition, under the terms of the lease, the Company is obligated to make certain minimum investments in
machinery, leasehold improvements and buildings by November 2012. In October 2009, the Company entered into an agreement for
the construction of a manufacturing facility in Singapore. The agreement is valued at SGD465 million approximately $332 million USD on December31, 2009. The expected construction term is 16 months and is followed by a maintenance term of
12 months. The Company operates its business and markets its products and services in most of the significant oil and gas
producing areas in the world and is, therefore, subject to the risk customarily attendant to international operations and dependency on the condition of the oil and gas industry. Additionally, products of the Company are used in potentially
hazardous drilling, completion, and production applications that can cause personal injury, product liability, and environmental claims. Although exposure to such risk has not resulted in any significant problems in the past, there can be no
assurance that future developments will not adversely impact the Company. The Company is also involved in a number of legal
actions arising in the ordinary course of business. Although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of such legal action, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability with respect thereto will not have a material
adverse affect on the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. 10. Stockholders Equity The Rights Agreement between the Company and ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C. dated as of October17, 1997 included one right to
purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for each share of common stock. On October17, 2007, the Rights Agreement and the rights issued thereunder expired by their terms, at which time no shares of
the Series A Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding. Under a Stockholder Rights Plan adopted by the Board of Directors on
November24, 2008, each share of common stock includes one right to purchase from the Company a unit consisting of one one-hundredth of a share a Fractional Share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a specific
purchase price per Fractional Share, subject to adjustment in certain event. The rights will cause substantial dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire the Company without the approval of the Companys Board of Directors.

The Companys operations are organized into three geographic segmentsWestern
Hemisphere including North and South America headquartered in Houston, Texas, Eastern Hemisphere including Europe and Africa; headquartered in Aberdeen, Scotland and Asia-Pacific including the Pacific Rim, Southeast Asia, Australia, India and
the Middle East; headquartered in Singapore. Each of these segments sells similar products and services and the Company has major manufacturing facilities in all three of its headquarter locations as well as Macae, Brazil. Eliminations of operating profits are related to intercompany inventory transfers that are deferred until shipment is made to third party
customers. In 2007 and 2008, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys revenues. In 2009, one
customer accounted for approximately 10% of the Companys total revenues. 12. Employee Stock Option Plan and Awards 
On September19, 1997, the Company adopted the Dril-Quip, Inc. 1997 Incentive Plan as amended, the 1997 Plan and the
Company reserved 3,400,000 shares of Common Stock for use in connection with the 1997 Plan. During 2001, the Company reserved an additional 1,400,000 shares for use in connection with the 1997 Plan. Some options remain outstanding under the 1997
Plan: however, no additional grants will be awarded under this plan. On May13, 2004, the Companys stockholders approved the 2004 Incentive Plan of Dril-Quip, Inc. the 2004 Plan, which reserved up to 2,696,294 shares of
Common Stock to be used in connection with the 2004 Plan. Persons eligible for awards under the 1997 Plan and 2004 Plan are employees holding positions of responsibility with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Options granted under the 1997
Plan and the 2004 Plan have a term of ten years and become exercisable in cumulative annual increments of one-fourth of the total number of shares of Common Stock subject thereto, beginning on the first anniversary of the date of the grant.
The fair value of stock options granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
expected life was based on the Companys historical trends and volatility was based on the expected life of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yield curve at the grant date. The Company does not pay dividends and
therefore, there is no dividend yield. On October26, 2007, October28, 2008 and October28, 2009, the Company
granted options to purchase 256,284, 408,123 and 243,470 shares respectively, of Common Stock pursuant to the 2004 Plan to certain officers and employees. The following table presents the assumptions used in the option pricing model.  2007 2008 2009 Expected life years 60 63 62 Volatility 458 462 488 Risk-free interest rate 404 275 237 Dividend yield 00 00 00 Fair value of each option 2676 1023 2422

The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised in 2007, 2008 and 2009 was $199
million, $13 million and $249 million, respectively. The income tax benefit realized from stock options exercised was $87 million for the year ended December31, 2009. Stock-based compensation is recognized as selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.
During the years ended December31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, stock-based compensation expense totaled $23 million, $32 million and $40 million, respectively. Stock option expense for 2009 excludes $13 million for the accelerated vesting of
Mr.Smiths remaining options upon his death as discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. This expense is included in Special Item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. No stock-based compensation expense was
capitalized during 2007, 2008 or 2009. Options granted to employees vest over four years and the Company recognizes
compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the options. At December31, 2009, there was $114 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock options. This expense is expected to be
recognized over a weighted average of 19 years. The following table summarizes information for equity compensation plans in

14. Common Stock In May 2008, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program under which the Company could repurchase up to $100 million of its Common Stock. At the end of the
third quarter of 2008, the Company had repurchased 1,799,928 shares at an average price of $5558 per share including commissions for a total of approximately $100 million. All repurchased shares were retired by September30, 2008.
15. Special Item In September 2009, Gary D. Smith, one of the Companys Co-Chief Executive Officers, unexpectedly passed away. Under the terms of Mr.Smiths employment contract, the Company was obligated to pay Mr.Smiths base
salary, including accrued vacation, and his annual bonus through the remaining employment period October 27, 2012. In addition, stock options owned by Mr.Smith that were outstanding at the date of his death were immediately vested under the
terms of the contract. Accordingly, the Company recognized a pre-tax expense of $52 million during the third quarter of 2009. The contractual obligation, including related payroll taxes, totaled $43 million, of which $434,000 had been previously
accrued. The acceleration of the vesting increased pre-tax non-cash expenses by $13 million. 16. Subsequent Events The Company has evaluated subsequent events through February25 , 2010, the date of the issuance of these consolidated financial

Controls and Procedures  In accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including the Companys Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on that evaluation, the Companys Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December31, 2009 to provide reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed in the Companys reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions
rules and forms, and such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Companys Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appears on page 35 of this annual report on Form
10-K. There has been no change in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the
three months ended December31, 2009 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal controls over financial reporting.  Item9B.
