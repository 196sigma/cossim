NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999, 1998 AND 1997 1   ORGANIZATION
InteliData Technologies Corporation InteliData or the Company, is
engaged in developing and marketing software products and services for financial
institutions to assist in Internet  Banking and electronic bill payment
initiatives. The Company is incorporated in the State of Delaware and operates
primarily from its corporate headquarters in Reston, Virginia.
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination
of all intercompany balances and transactions. Certain items from the 1998 and
1997 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 1999
financial statement presentation.
b Accounting Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
c Revenue Recognition - Revenue for off-the-shelf product is recorded when
products are shipped and title passes to the customer. Lease revenue is recorded
based on the units in service at the end of the prior month since these leases
are cancelable at any time. Revenue from consulting, hosting, and maintenance
contracts are recognized as services are provided. Beginning in 1998, the
Company sold  integrated  solutions that bundle  software  products with
customization, installation and training services. These arrangements are
recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting. Losses on
uncompleted contracts are recorded when such amounts become determinable.
d Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all non-restricted highly
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates
market.
e Short-term Investments - The Company reports its short-term investments in
marketable securities as available-for-sale with any unrealized gains losses
reflected, net of tax, as other comprehensive income loss. Realized gains or
losses are determined on the first-in, first-out method and are reflected in net
income. f Property and Equipment - Property and equipment is stated at cost.
Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Office equipment and
furniture and fixtures are depreciated over 3 to 7 years.
g Net Liabilities Assets of Discontinued Operations - Under various disposal
plans adopted in 1997 and 1998, the Company has completed the divestiture
of all of its telecommunications and interactive services businesses, excluding
Caller ID adjunct leasing activities. See Note 4 to the financial statements.
h Deferred Revenues - The Company received $5 million from Visa in the fourth
quarter of 1997, as a result of an agreement whereby the Company surrendered the
right to certain future royalty payments. The cash payment was recorded in
deferred revenues and was recognized in other revenues over the two year period
of the arrangement. Other deferred revenues represents cash received for
services to be provided.
i Income Taxes - Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the asset
and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is
established against deferred tax assets when it is deemed, based on available
evidence, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax asset will not be realized.
j Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - The Company applies APB Opinion
No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its plans. Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS 123 was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in 1995 and,
if fully adopted, changes the methods for recognition of cost on plans similar
to those of the Company. The Company has elected to continue to apply the
provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and provide the pro forma disclosure pursuant
to SFAS 123.
k Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders per share - Basic and diluted
loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss, after deducting
preferred stock dividend requirements and amortization of the discounts on the
preferred stock, by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the year. The effects of stock options were not included in
the loss per share computations because they would have been antidilutive.
l Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The carrying values of the Company
financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
accounts payable approximate their fair values. m New Accounting Pronouncements - In June, 1998, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities SFAS 133, which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities by requiring
that all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet and measured at fair
value. As amended by SFAS 137, SFAS 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2000.
n Long-Lived Assets - The Company considers the impairment of long-lived
assets based on an assessment of the asset ability to contribute to the
profitability of the Company using estimates of expected future undiscounted
cash flows. 3   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
In November, 1999, Home Financial Network, Inc. HFN, a company in which
InteliData held approximately a 25% ownership interest, signed a letter of
intent to merge with Sybase, Inc. On January 20, 2000, the merger was completed.
In exchange for its portion of ownership in HFN, InteliData received $5,867,000
in cash and 1,770,000 shares of Sybase stock. InteliData will recognize a gain
of approximately $39,272,000 on such sale during the first quarter of 2000.
InteliData accounted for such investment in HFN using the equity method. As of
December 31, 1999, such investment carrying value was zero. An escrow account
was established to provide Sybase, Inc. indemnity protection against possible
claims that might arise against HFN. Currently, 1332,000 shares of Sybase owned
by InteliData remain in escrow, along with $440,000 of cash. These amounts
reflect 75% of the transaction proceed and are payable to the Company on
January 20, 2001.
4   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
During the second quarter of 1998, the Company adopted a plan to dispose of
its various telecommunications divisions through sale and liquidation. The
Company Caller ID adjunct inventory was sold in May 1998. The Company Plexus
inventory was sold in December 1998. The Company IPS and Landmark inventory
was sold in February, 1999. At December 31, 1999, the net liabilities of
discontinued operations, consisting primarily of warehouse facilities, offset by
liabilities associated with a building escrow, building shut-down costs and
product reserves, have been classified as current liabilities at their estimated
net realizable value. Net revenues and loss from discontinued operations are as follows                            Years Ended December 31,

Summary of Discontinued Operations
The gain on disposal of the telecommunications and interactive services
divisions net of income taxes was $3,226,000 in 1999 compared to a loss of
$16,174,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998. The gain of $3,226,000 is
attributable to specific events that occurred during the year including:
favorable settlements with former telecommunications customers, the success of
other settlements with vendors and negotiated expense settlements, aggressive
collection efforts, and experiencing lower than anticipated shut-down costs such
as warranty and customer service expenses associated with closing down the
discontinued operations.
During 1998, the loss from operations of telecommunications and interactive
services divisions net of income taxes included $13,784,000 in inventory
adjustments. The loss on disposal of telecommunications and interactive service
divisions consisted of $2,696,000 in expected sales returns, $3,539,000 in
property adjustments, $3,010,000 in provisions for doubtful customer accounts
and $6,929,000 in actual and expected  losses from operations from the
measurement date through the date of disposal.   During the third quarter of 1997, the Company recorded a provision for
corporate restructuring of $1,003,000. This amount consists of $771,000 in
employee reduction and related matters, $190,000 in obsolete equipment, and
$42,000 in facilities closings. During the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company
incurred employee reductions and relocation expenses aggregating $177,000 and a
write-down related to obsolete equipment of $190,000 Additional accruals were
posted for closing operations during 1998.   During the third quarter of 1997, the Company announced a strategic
repositioning of the Company telecommunications. In connection with this
repositioning and the aforementioned corporate restructuring, the Company
management  evaluated its financial position and determined that it was
appropriate to charge to discontinued operations the remaining unamortized costs
of intangible assets due to impairment, to adjust inventory carrying amounts to
market value, and to reflect certain additional restructuring charges, including
charges for separation agreements with employees and charges associated with the
termination of a joint venture agreement. Such third quarter 1997 charges
aggregated $49,246,000 for the impairment of intangible assets; $11,333,000 for
inventories and commitments; $1,003,000 for restructuring charges see above 1,434,000 for separation agreements; and $3,653,000 for assets relating to the
joint venture. The impairment was based on the excess of the carrying value of
the assets over the assets' fair values. The fair value of the assets were
generally determined as the estimates of future discounted cash flows generated
by the assets.
5   SEGMENT REPORTING
The Company maintains operations in two primary operating segments:
Internet Banking and leasing. The basis for determining the Company operating
segments is the manner in which financial information is used by the Company in
managing its operations. Management operates and organizes itself according to
business units which comprise unique products and services. There are no
intersegment sales. Operating loss income in these two market divisions
represents total revenues less operating expenses, and excludes other income and
expense and income taxes. Identifiable assets are those assets employed by each
segment operation. Segment financial information is as follows in thousands                   Internet

8   RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Strategic Business Partner
In August 1994, the Company sold its electronic banking and bill pay
operations the Visa Bill-Pay  System to Visa. As part of the Visa
transaction, the Company president was appointed to, and the Company
chairman was named an advisor to, the board of directors of Visa InterActive.
Included in service fee revenues are $751,000 in 1997 related to services
provided by the Company to Visa InterActive and Visa banks/members. In August
1997, Visa InterActive was sold to an unrelated party, and the Company
officers resigned from their Visa InterActive board positions. 9   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
a   Issuance and Subsequent Conversion of Preferred Stock and Warrants
On July 22, 1999, the Company issued 600 shares of 4% Convertible Preferred
Stock, for net proceeds of $5,670,000. A portion of the proceeds was allocated
to warrants and to the beneficial conversion feature of such preferred stock,
with the resulting discount on the preferred stock being amortized as dividends.
In the fourth quarter of 1999, all of the preferred stock was converted to
common shares.
b Stock Options   The Company sponsors several stock option plans which cover substantially
all employees and directors. Options granted under such plans typically vest
monthly over periods ranging from one to five years and generally expire after
between eight and ten years, although some grants provide for vesting in annual
increments or allow for accelerated vesting based upon reaching performance
milestones. Most options granted under the plans allow the purchase of stock at
the fair value of such common stock at the respective grant dates.
In 1997 and in June 1998, employees other than the then President and Chief
Executive Officer were given the opportunity to cancel their options and have
them replaced with options with strike prices equal to the common stock fair
value on those dates option repricing.
A summary of stock option activity for each of the Company stock option
plans is as follows                 Exercise Prices

The Company applies the intrinsic value method of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its stock
plans. In connection therewith, during 1998 and 1997, the Company recognized
$18,000 and $115,000 of compensation expense in connection with option grants at
exercise prices below fair market value on the dates of the grant.
Had compensation cost been determined based on the fair value method of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, the Company net loss and
loss per share basic and diluted for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998
and 1997 would have been $7,679,000 and $23 per share, $38,437,000 and $122
per share; and $95,180,000 and $301 per share, respectively.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during 1999, 1998 and
1997 was $153, $115 and $257 per share, respectively. The fair value of
options granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. For 1999 year-end, the following weighted average
assumptions were used: no dividend yield, expected volatility of 156%, and a
risk free interest rate of 55% per annum. For 1998 year-end, the following
weighted average assumptions were used: no dividend yield, expected volatility
of 136% and a risk free interest rate of 528 per annum. For 1997
year-end, the following weighted average assumptions were used: no dividend
yield expected volatility of 85% and a risk-free interest rate of 600% per
annum.

c   Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, approved in 1996, the Company is
authorized to issue up to 500,000 shares of common stock to its full-time
employees, nearly all of whom are eligible to participate. Under the terms of
the Plan, employees can choose each period to have up to twenty percent of their
annual base earnings withheld to purchase the Company common stock. The
purchase  price  of the  stock  is 85  percent  of the  lower of its
beginning-of-period or end-of-period market price. During the years ended
December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997 the Company issued 33,498, 44,307, and 68,056
shares of stock under the plan, respectively.
d Treasury Stock
During 1997, the Company paid $2,064,000 to repurchase 681,500 shares of
its common stock. The Company did not repurchase any shares in 1998 or 1999.
e   Stockholder Rights Plan
In January 1998, the Company Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder
Rights Plan. The rights are designed to assure that all the Company
stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed
takeover of the Company and to guard against partial tender offers, open market
accumulations and other tactics to gain control of the Company without paying
all stockholders a control premium.
Terms of the Stockholder Rights Plan provide for a dividend distribution of
one right for each share of common stock to holders of record at the close of
business on February 6, 1998. Shareholders will be able to exercise the rights
only in the event, with certain exceptions, an acquiring party accumulates 20
percent or more of the Company voting stock or if a party an acquiring person announces an offer to acquire
20 percent or more without prior approval of the Company Board of Directors.
The rights will expire on January 21, 2008. Each right initially will entitle
the holder to buy one one-thousandth of a share of a new series of preferred
stock at a price of $13.
In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, holders of the rights
will be entitled to purchase either the Company common stock or shares in an
acquiring person at half of market value. Further, at any time after a person or
group acquires 20 percent or more of the Company outstanding voting stock, the
board of directors may, at its option, exchange part or all of the rights other
than rights held by the acquiring person, which will become void for shares of
the Company common stock on a one-for-one basis. The rights will therefore
cause substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires 20 percent or more
of the Company common stock on terms not approved by the board.
10   UNUSUAL CHARGES
During the third quarter of 1997, the Company assessed and adjusted the
carrying value of goodwill associated with an earlier acquisition.  The
impairment charge aggregated $2,035,000 and was based on the excess of the
carrying value of the assets over the assets' fair values. The fair value of the
assets were generally determined as the estimates of future discounted cash
flows generated by the assets.
11   EMPLOYEE 401k SAVINGS PLAN
The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan Plan that qualifies
for preferential tax treatment under Section 401a of the Internal Revenue
Code. Participation in the Plan is available to employees who are at least
twenty-one years of age and have three months of service. Company contributions
to the Plan are based on a percentage of employee contributions. The Company
contributed  $60,000,  $128,000,  and $99,000 in 1999,  1998, and 1997,
respectively. Administrative expenses for the Plan were paid by the Company.

December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 were an increase of $602,000 $3,923,000 and
$15,485,000, respectively. A valuation allowance was established for deferred
tax assets as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 because it was deemed, based on
available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax
asset will not be realized.
At December 31, 1999, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for
federal income tax purposes of approximately $117 million, which expire in 2007
through 2014, general business tax credits of approximately $489,000, which
expire in 2005 through 2010, and an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward
of approximately $60,000, which may be carried forward indefinitely and used to
offset future regular taxable income.
13   MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk
consist principally of trade receivables. The Company sells its products
primarily to financial institutions in the United States and leases caller ID
adjuncts to individual consumers. The Company believes that the concentration of
credit risk in its trade receivables is substantially mitigated by the Company
ongoing credit evaluation process. The Company does not generally require
collateral from customers. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful
accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers,
historical trends and other information.
Combined revenues from US West lease customers and the Visa Bill-Pay System
royalties represented 60%, 81%, and 82% of total revenues for the years ending
December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. In January, 2000, the Company
received notification from its billing agent regarding proposed changes to the
billing process for the US West Caller ID Lease Base. The pending changes, which
could require the Company lease billings to be removed from the US West
customer bills, could have a substantial effect on the rate of decline of the
lease base, the cost of billing,  and the Company ability to pursue
collections. Any changes in billing procedures could negatively affect the
Company revenue, cost of sales, gross margin, and cash flow in future periods. 14   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
a   Leases
The Company leases  facilities and equipment  under  cancelable and
noncancellable operating lease agreements. The facility leases are for terms
from one to five years. Rent expense was $483,000, $877,000 and $1,054,000 for
the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
Future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases with
initial or remaining terms in excess of one year at December 31, 1999, were as

b   Patent Matters
The Company does not believe that its products and services infringe on the
rights of third parties. From time to time, third parties assert infringement
claims against InteliData. There can be no assurance that any such assertion
will not result in costly litigation or require the Company to cease using, or
obtain a license to use, intellectual property rights of such parties.
c   Litigation
The Company is not currently a party to any material litigation. From time
to time, the Company is a party to routine litigation incidental to its
business. Management does not believe that the resolution of any or all of such
routine litigation will be likely to have a material adverse effect on the
Company financial condition or results of operations. 15   VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS

InteliData Technologies Corporation
Reston, Virginia
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of InteliData
Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31,
1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1999. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of InteliData Technologies Corporation
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP
