To the Board of Directors and 
Shareholders of Point360 
Hollywood, California 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Point360 and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Point360 and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
1. THE COMPANY: 
Point360 Point360 or the Company provides video and film asset management services to owners, producers and distributors of entertainment and advertising content. The Company provides the services necessary to edit, master, reformat, archive and distribute its clients video content, including television programming, spot advertising and movie trailers. The Company provides worldwide electronic distribution, using fiber optics and satellites. The Company delivers commercials, movie trailers, electronic press kits, infomercials and syndicated programming, by both physical and electronic means, to thousands of broadcast outlets worldwide. The Company operates in one reportable segment. 
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Basis of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its two non-operating wholly owned subsidiaries, VDI Multimedia, Inc. and Multimedia Services, Inc., which subsidiaries were shell companies dissolved in 2003. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash equivalents represent highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of less than three months. 
Revenues and Receivables 
The Company records revenues when the services have been completed. Although sales and receivables are concentrated in the entertainment and advertising industries, credit risk due to financial insolvency is limited because of the financial stability of the customer base i.e., large studios and advertising agencies. 
Concentration of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions; at times, such balances with any one financial institution may exceed FDIC insured limits. 
Credit risk with respect to trade receivables is concentrated due to the large number of orders with major entertainment studios in any particular reporting period. The seven major studios represented 44% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2002 and 31% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2003. The Company reviews credit evaluations of its customers but does not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables. 
The seven major studios accounted for 34% and 29% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively. 
Inventories 
Inventories comprise raw materials, principally tape stock, and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the average cost method. 
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for additions and major improvements are capitalized. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the remaining lease term. The estimated useful life of property and equipment is seven years and leasehold improvements are ten years. 27 Goodwill and Other Intangibles 
Prior to the January 1, 2002 implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142, goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over 5-20 years. Since that date, goodwill has been subject to periodic impairment tests in accordance with SFAS 142. Other intangibles consist primarily of covenants not to compete and are amortized on a straight-line basis over 3-5 years. 
The Company identifies and records impairment losses on long-lived assets, including goodwill that is not identified with an impaired asset, when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired. Events and circumstances that may indicate that an asset is impaired include significant decreases in the market value of an asset, a change in the operating model or strategy and competitive forces. 
If events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and the expected undiscounted future cash flow attributable to the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value is recorded. Fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk involved, quoted market prices or appraised values, depending on the nature of the assets. To date, no such impairment has been recorded. 
Income Taxes 
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109. SFAS 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded for that portion of deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. 
Advertising Costs 
Advertising costs are not significant to the Companys operations and are expensed as incurred. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
To meet the reporting requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments SFAS 107, the Company calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to financial statements when the fair value is different than the book value of those financial instruments. When the fair value is equal to the book value, no additional disclosure is made. The Company uses quoted market prices whenever available to calculate these fair values. 
The accrual method of accounting is used for the interest rate swap agreement entered into by the Company which converts the interest rate on $15 million of the Companys variable-rate debt to a fixed rate see Note 6. Under the accrual method, each net payment or receipt due or owed under the derivative is recognized in income in the period to which the payment or receipt relates. Amounts to be paid/received under these agreements are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense. The related amounts payable to counter parties is included in other accrued liabilities. The estimated fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was a net payable of $701,000 at December 31, 2002. The swap agreement expired in November 2003. 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 
As permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123, the Company measures compensation costs in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, but provides pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share using the fair value method defined by FAS 123. Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period based on the difference, if any, on the date of grant between the deemed fair value for accounting purposes of the Companys stock and the exercise price on the date of grant. The Company accounts for stock issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issu
ed to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods and Services. 28 Had the Company determined compensation cost based on the fair value for its stock options at grant date, as set forth under SFAS 123, the Companys net income and earning per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below: 2001 2002 2003 Net income loss: As reported  
1,494,000 
2,817,000  
3,149,000 Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax effects 1,772,000 
516,000 
310,000 
Pro forma 3,266,000 
2,301,000 2,839,000 Earnings loss per share: As reported: Basic 017 
031 035 Diluted 017 
030 033 Pro forma: Basic 036 
026 031 Diluted 036 
025 030 
The fair value for these options was estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively: expected volatility of 88%, 94% and 60% and risk-free interest rates of 453%, 400% and 105%. A dividend yield of 0% and expected life of five years was assumed for 2001, 2002 and 2003 grants. The weighted average fair value of options granted at the fair market price on the grant date in 2001, 2002 and 2003 were $164, $176 and $300, respectively. In 2001, the weighted average fair value of options granted at an exercise price in excess of the fair market price on the grant date was $048. All other options granted in 2001, 2002 and 2003 were at fair market price. 
Earnings Per Share 
The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share SFAS 128, and related interpretations for reporting Earnings per Share. SFAS 128 requires dual presentation of Basic Earnings per Share Basic EPS and Diluted Earnings per Share Diluted EPS. Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reported period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options were exercised using the treasury stock method. 
In accordance with SFAS 128, basic earnings loss per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares, assuming such shares were outstanding during the reporting period. Stock options for the purchase of 386,245 shares with a weighted average exercise price of $140 for the year ended December 31, 2001 were not included in the computation of diluted EPS as they are anti-dilutive as a result of net loss during the year. 
A reconciliation of the denominator of the basic EPS computation to the denominator of the diluted EPS computation is as follows: 2001 2002 2003 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding used in computation of basic EPS 9,060,487 9,013,224 9,067,446 Dilutive effect of outstanding stock options  363,483 487,401 Weighted average number of common and potential common shares outstanding used in computation of diluted EPS 9,060,487 9,376,707 9,554,847 Outstanding stock options excluded in the computation of diluted EPS 3,286,628 2,435,086 1,573,277 Comprehensive Income 
In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income SFAS 130. This Statement establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. Comprehensive income, as defined, includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. 29 Supplemental Cash Flow Information 
Selected cash payments and noncash activities were as follows: 2001 2002 2003 Cash payments for income taxes 121,000 1,364,000 2,626,000 Cash payments for interest 2,830,000 2,453,000 1,852,000 Noncash investing and financing activities: Termination of warrants    619,000 Capitalized lease obligations incurred 145,000 69,000  Tax benefits related to stock options   7,000 59,000 Adjustment of acquisition holdback shares 317,000 17,000  Acquisition of equipment in exchange for reduction of note receivable from shareholder 68,000   Accrual for earn-out payments 270,000   Termination of stock purchase warrants incurred as part of proposed acquisition  617,000 Obligation to purchase tenant improvements  800,000 Right to purchase tenant improvements  800,000 Leasehold improvements transferred from prepaid expenses   100,000 Detail of acquisitions: Goodwill 1 1,257,000 1,563,000

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS Nos. 141 and 142, Business Combinations and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, respectively. SFAS No. 141 replaces Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 16. It also provides guidance on purchase accounting related to the recognition of intangible assets and accounting for negative goodwill. SFASNo. 142 changes the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment-only approach. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill will be tested annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. The Company tested goodwill as of January 1, 2002, September 30, 2002 and Septembe
r 30, 2003 with no impairment indicated. 
In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock-based compensation. This statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. Other than supplemental footnote disclosures, SFAS No. 148 did not have any impact on the Company financial statements as management does not have any intention to change to the fair value method. 
In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 149 is effective for derivative instruments and hedging activities entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, except for certain forward purchase and sale securities. For these forward purchase and sale securities, SFAS No. 149 is effective for both new and existing securities after June 30, 2003. SFAS No. 149 did not have a material impact on the Companys statements of earnings, financial position, or cash flows. 
In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. In accordance with the standard, financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer are required to be classified as liabilities. SFAS No. 150 will be effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and otherwise will be effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. SFAS No. 150 does not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. 30 3. ACQUISITIONS 
During 1997 to 2001, the Company acquired eight businesses. These acquisitions were accounted for as purchases, with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired allocated to goodwill. The contingent portion of the purchase prices, to the extent earned, were recorded as an increase to goodwill. As of December 31, 2003, based on prior performance of the applicable acquired entities, no additional earn-out amounts will be paid. The consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of the acquired companies since their respective acquisition dates. 
Goodwill and other intangibles, net as of December 31, 2002 and 2003, consist of the following: Actual 2002 2003 Goodwill 
32,762,000  
32,622,000 Covenant not to compete 992,000 1,000,000 33,754,000 33,622,000 Less accumulated amortization 6,542,000 
6,576,000 
27,212,000  
27,046,000 Amortization expense totaled $2,007,000, $80,000 and $35,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. The Company ceased amortizing goodwill on January 1, 2002 with the adoption of SFAS 142. Amortization of the covenant not to compete was $35,000 in 2003 at which time the covenant was fully amortized. 
In July 2002, the Company acquired an option to purchase three subsidiaries the Subsidiaries of Alliance Atlantis Communications Inc. Alliance engaged in businesses directly related to those of the Company. In consideration for the option, the Company issued to Alliance a warrant to acquire 500,000 shares of the Companys common stock at $200 per share. The warrant was to expire five years from the closing date of the transaction, or July 3, 2005 if the Company did not purchase the Subsidiaries. In connection therewith, the Company capitalized the fair value of the warrant $619,000 determined by using the Black-Scholes valuation model as an other asset on the balance sheet. 
In December 2002, the option was extended to March 10, 2003. In connection with the extension, the Company made a $300,000 deposit toward the purchase price of the Subsidiaries, which deposit was nonrefundable except in very limited circumstances. The deposit was capitalized as an other asset. Additionally, the Company capitalized approximately $700,000 of due diligence and other expenses associated with the proposed acquisition during the six months ended June 30, 2003. 
The Company did not exercise its option to purchase the Subsidiaries by the March 10, 2003 termination date; however, Alliance agreed to continue negotiations with the Company to complete the transaction. 
In connection with the possible acquisition of the Subsidiaries, the Company entered discussions with several possible lenders to provide financing for the purchase of the Subsidiaries and to pay off the Companys existing term loan with a group of banks. A provision in the Companys current term loan agreement prohibited acquisitions unless approved by the banks, which permission had been denied. 
In June 2003, discussions with Alliance and the new lenders were terminated. As a result, the Company wrote off the above mentioned deposit, due diligence costs and approximately $400,000 of legal and other costs associated with the proposed new financing. The $619,000 value of the warrant was reversed against Additional Paid-in Capital because, in managements opinion, Alliance had breached certain provisions of the option agreement resulting in a termination event according to the provisions of the warrant. In July 2003, Alliance filed a complaint in the United States District Court, Central District of California, seeking a judicial determination that Alliance has full right of legal ownership to the warrant as well as the $300,000 deposit. In managements opinion, it is too early to determine the outcome of the claims. If the Company is not successful in this defense the warrant value will have to be expensed. 
On July 18, 2003, Alliance filed a complaint against the Company in the Superior Court of Justice, Ontario, Canada. The complaint alleges that the Company breached a non-disclosure agreement between Alliance and the Company by issuing a press release with respect to termination of negotiations to purchase the Subsidiaries without obtaining the required prior written consent of Alliance. Alliance maintains that the press release impaired its ability to extract value from the Subsidiaries and negatively affected its ability to sell the Subsidiaries to a third party. The complaint seeks breach of contract and punitive damages of approximately $44 million, expenses and a permanent order enjoining further such statements by the Company. In managements opinion, it is too early to determine the outcome of the claims. 
On August 11, 2003, the Company filed a counterclaim in the United States District Court, Central District of California against Alliance for, among other things, misrepresentation and breach of contract seeking cancellation of the warrant and general damages of at least $12 million. The outcome of the counterclaim cannot be estimated at this time. 31 4. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT:  
Property and equipment consist of the following: December 31, 2002 2003 Machinery and equipment 
38,156,000  
38,945,000 Leasehold improvements 7,673,000 7,773,000 Computer equipment 4,232,000 4,520,000 Equipment under capital lease 291,000 291,000 50,352,000 51,529,000 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization 30,387,000

19,965,000  
15,751,000 Depreciation expense totaled $5,301,000, $5,258,000 and $5,464,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Accumulated amortization on capital leases amounted to $99,000 and $125,000, as of December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively. 
5. 401K PLAN 
The Company has a 401K plan which covers substantially all employees. Each participant is permitted to make voluntary contributions not to exceed the lesser of 20% of his or her respective compensation or the applicable statutory limitation, and is immediately 100% vested. The Company matches one-fourth of the first 4% contributed by the employee. Company contributions to the plan were $102,000, $99,000 and $92,000 in 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. 
6. LONG TERM DEBT AND NOTES PAYABLE:  
Term Loans and Revolving Credit 
In September 2000, the Company entered into a credit agreement Agreement with a group of banks providing a revolving credit facility of up to $45,000,000. Loans made under the Agreement were collateralized by substantially all of the Companys assets. The borrowing base under the Agreement was limited to 90% of eligible accounts receivable, 50% of inventory and 100% of operating machinery and equipment. 
The Agreement also contained covenants requiring certain levels of annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA and net worth, and limited the amount of capital expenditures. By December 31, 2000, the Company had borrowed $31,024,000 under the Agreement and was not in compliance with certain financial covenants due to adjustments recorded to prior years and 2000 results. The bank waived compliance with the covenants and amended the Agreement in April 2001. 
As of April 30, May 31 and June 30, 2001, outstanding amounts under the line of credit exceeded the borrowing base. On June 11 and July 20, 2001, the Company entered into amendment and forbearance agreements with the banks which required the Company to repay the amount of excess borrowings and amended the Agreement to reduce the aggregate commitment from $45,000,000 to $30,050,000 until the expiration of the commitment on December 31, 2005. In August 2001, the Company did not make required debt payments which created a breach of the amendment and forbearance agreements. As a consequence of the breach, the amount outstanding under the credit facility became immediately due and payable. 
In May 2002, the Company and the banks entered into a restructured loan agreement changing the revolving credit facility to a term loan, with all existing defaults being waived. The term loan had a maturity date of December 31, 2004. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company made a $2 million principal payment and made additional principal payments of $35 million and $70 million in 2002 and 2003, respectively. The agreement provided for interest at the banks reference rate plus 125% and requires the Company to maintain certain financial covenant ratios. The term loan was secured by substantially all of the Companys assets. In connection with the restructuring, the Company wrote off $265,000 of deferred financing costs related to the original Agreement in the second quarter of 2002. Certain legal and other costs associated with the new term loan, including restructuring
fees of $50,000 and $250,000 paid in May 2002 and June 2003, respectively, were capitalized to be amortized over the remaining life of the loan. 
As of March 31, 2003, the Company believed that the acquisition described in Note 3 above would be completed, as well as a complete refinancing of the term loan. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, the Company expensed the then-remaining deferred costs associated with the term loan, $114,000. In June 2003, acquisition and refinancing discussions were terminated, the $114,000 write-off was reversed and the $250,000 fee was paid June 30, 2003. The Company simultaneously resumed amortization of the deferred costs based on the December 31, 2004 due date of the term loan. As a result of the first quarter write-off and the second quarter reversal, income for the first quarter of calendar 2003 was reduced $114,000 $66,000 net of tax and income for the second quarter was increased $114,000 $66,000 net of tax. 32 In June and September 2003, the Company made an additional term loan principal payments of $1,000,000 each after considering its positive cash position, future cash requirements and the desire to reduce interest costs. 
See Note 12 regarding revised credit facilities with the banks. 
Interest Rate Swap 
In November 2000, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract to economically hedge its floating debt rate. Under the terms of the contract, the notional amount is $15,000,000, whereby the Company receives LIBOR and pays a fixed 65% rate of interest for three years. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133 requires that the interest rate swap contract be recorded at fair value upon adoption of SFAS 133 and quarterly by recording i a cumulative-effect type adjustment at January 1, 2001 equal to the fair value of the interest rate swap contract on that date, ii amortizing the cumulative-effect type adjustment quarterly over the life of the derivative contract, and iii a charge or credit to income in the amount of the difference between the fair value o
f the interest rate swap contract at the beginning and end of such quarter. The effect of adopting SFAS 133 was to record an initial cumulative-effect balance sheet adjustment by charging Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income a component of shareholders equity $247,000 net of $62,000 tax benefit, crediting Derivative Valuation Liability by the $309,000 gross cumulative-effect adjustment and charging Deferred Income Taxes $62,000.

The Company has financed the purchase of certain equipment through the issuance of notes payable and under capital leasing arrangements. The notes bear interest at rates ranging from 93% to 129%. Such obligations are payable in monthly installments through May 2005. 
Annual maturities for debt, under both the credit agreement and capital lease obligations as of December 31, 2003, are as follows: 2004 15,924,000 2005 5,000 Thereafter   15,929,000 See Note 12 regarding revised credit facilities. 33 7. INCOME TAXES:

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:
Operating Leases 
The Company leases office and production facilities in California, Illinois, Texas and New York under various operating leases. Approximate minimum rental payments under these non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2003 are as follows: 2004  
3,658,000 2005 2,998,000 2006 2,919,000 2007 2,961,000 2008 2,157,000 Thereafter 7,929,000 Total rental expense was approximately $3,482,000, $3,106,000 and $3,436,000 for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, respectively. 
In November 2003, the Company leased a new 64,600 square foot building in Los Angeles, California, for the purpose of consolidating four vault locations then occupying approximately 71, 000 square feet. After the initial build-out of the new facility and termination of the existing leases during 2004, the resulting annual lease and operating expense levels are expected to be favorable to the Company. 
As part of the transaction, the Company paid $600,000 for an option to purchase the building for approximately $8,600,000. Additionally, the landlord, General Electric Capital Business Asset Funding Corporation General Electric, has committed to finance approximately $6,500,000 of the purchase price at a fixed interest rate of 775% over 15 years. The Company is not obligated to purchase the building or, if the option is exercised, borrow any portion of the purchase price from General Electric. During the period between November 2004 and the May 2005 purchase option date, the Company will decide whether or not to purchase the building. The cost of the option is included in other assets on the balance sheet, to be capitalized as a cost of the building or written off if the Company exercises the purchase option or does not exercise the option, respectively. Until a purc
hase decision has been reached, the minimum lease obligations have been included in above. 
Pursuant to the lease, General Electric also advanced the Company $800,000 to pay for improvements to the building. Any portion of the $800,000 not spent by November 25, 2004 will have to be returned to General Electric. As of December 31, 2003, the $800,000 has been reflected as obligation to purchase property and equipment as a long-term asset with an offsetting obligation on the balance sheet. The Company will reduce the accrued liability as the cash is expended for improvements to the building. 
On September 30, 2003 the Company entered into severance agreements with its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer which continue in effect through December 31, 2005, and are renewed automatically on an annual basis after that unless notice is received terminating the agreement by September 30 of the preceding year. The severance agreements contain a Golden Parachute provision. 
9. STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN:  
In February 1999, the Company announced that it would commence a stock repurchase program approved by the Board. The Company did not set a target number of shares to be repurchased. Under the stock repurchase program, the Company was to purchase outstanding shares in such amounts and at such times and prices determined at the sole discretion of management. 
The funds for the stock repurchases were provided by the Companys credit facility with a bank which permitted repurchases up to $5,000,000. During the three years ended December 31, 2001, the Company repurchased $4,391,000 of common stock. The Company was then restricted from further repurchases by the amended credit agreement. 
10. STOCK OPTION PLANS:  
Stock Option Plans 
In May 1996, the Board of Directors, approved the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan the 1996 Plan. The 1996 Plan provides for the award of options to purchase up to 900,000 shares of common stock, as well as stock appreciation rights, performance share awards and restricted stock awards. In July 1999, the Companys shareholders approved an amendment to the 1996 Plan increasing the number of shares reserved for grant to 2,000,000 and providing for automatic increases of 300,000 shares on each August 1 thereafter to a maximum of 4,000,000 shares. As of December 31, 2003, there were 1,236,478 options outstanding under the 1996 Plan and 1,924,120 options were available for grant. 35 In December 2000, the Companys Board of Directors adopted the 2000 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan the 2000 Plan. As amended, the 2000 Plan provides for the award of options to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of common stock. Options may be granted under the 2000 Plan solely to attract people who have not previously been employed by the Company as a substantial inducement to join the Company. As of December 31, 2003, there were 814,200 options outstanding under the plan and 674,550 options were available for grant. 
Under both plans, the stock option price per share for options granted is determined by the Board of Directors and is based on the market price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant, and each option is exercisable within the period and in the increments as determined by the Board, except that no option can be exercised later than ten years from the date it was granted. The stock options generally vest over one to five years and for some options, earlier if the market price of the Companys common stock exceeds certain levels. 
In accounting for its plans, the Company, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. As a result of this election, the Company does not recognize compensation expense for its stock option plans since the exercise price of the options granted equals the fair value of the stock on the date of grant.

033 12. REVISED CREDIT FACILITY 
On March 12, 2004, the Company entered into a new credit agreement which provides up to $10 million of revolving credit availability for two years and a five-year $8 million term loan. For the first two years of the term loan, the Company can re-borrow all principal payments to finance up to 80% of capital equipment purchases. The agreement provides for interest at the banks prime rate or LIBOR plus 225% for the revolver, prime rate plus 025% or LIBOR plus 250% for the term loan, and requires the Company to maintain certain financial covenant ratios. The facilities are secured by all of the Companys assets. The term loan requires principal payments of $16 million annually. The $15,866,000 outstanding term loan as of December 31, 2003 was repaid by $1,000,000 of scheduled principal payments made in January and February 2004 and, on March 12, 2004, by new term loan bo
rrowings of $8,000,000 and cash payment of $6,866,000. For financial statement purposes, as of December 31, 2003, an amount representing the portion of the new term loan due after December 31, 2004 $6,667,000 has been classified as long-term. 37 To the Board of Directors
