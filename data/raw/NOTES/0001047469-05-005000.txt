Board of Directors and Shareholders
Cepheid 
We
have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Cepheid maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Cepheid management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. 
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In
our opinion, management assessment that Cepheid maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Cepheid maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on
the COSO criteria.
We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Cepheid as of
December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004
and our report dated February24, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/

The
Board of Directors and Shareholders
Cepheid 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cepheid as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at c. These
financial statements are the responsibility of Cepheid management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Cepheid at December31, 2004 and 2003,
and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein. 
We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Cepheid internal control over financial
reporting as of
December31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
February24, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/

CEPHEID NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December31, 2004    
1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Organization and Business 
Cepheid the Company was incorporated in the State of California on March4, 1996. The Company develops, manufactures, and markets fully-integrated
systems that perform genetic analysis for the clinical genetic assessment, life sciences and biothreat markets. The Company systems enable rapid, sophisticated genetic testing of organisms by
automating otherwise complex manual laboratory procedures. 
Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements of Cepheid include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary in France. The functional currency of the
French subsidiary is the U.S. dollar; accordingly, all gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in the consolidated statements
of operations. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation. 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
Financial Instruments  The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
short-term debt and long-term debt approximated fair value as of December31, 2004 and 2003. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks, money market instruments, commercial paper and debt securities with original maturities of
90days or less. At December31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had $232million and $185million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. Interest income includes
interest, dividends, amortization of purchase premiums and discounts, and realized gains and losses on sales of securities. 
Marketable Securities 
Our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value. Unrealized holding gains or losses are reported
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss. At December31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had $343million and zero, respectively, in marketable securities. Marketable
securities with maturities greater than 90days and less than one year are classified as short-term, otherwise they are classified as long term. An
impairment charge is recognized when the decline in the fair value of a security below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. We
consider various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge, including the duration of time and the 
54  severity
to which the fair value has been less than our amortized cost basis, any adverse changes in the investees' financial condition and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period
of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. To date we have not recorded any impairment charges on investments related to other-than-temporary
declines in market value. 
Restricted Cash 
Restricted cash consists of a certificate of deposits and bank term deposits all with maturities of greater than 90days. The Company had
$07million in restricted cash balance at December31, 2004 and 2003 which was collateral for a standby letter of credit issued in connection with a facility lease obligation. Inventory 
Inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost or market, with cost determined on the
first-in-first-out FIFO method. 
The
Company maintains a reserve for inventory obsolescence. This reserve is established utilizing management estimate of the potential future obsolescence of inventory. At
December31, 2004 and 2003, the reserve for inventory obsolescence was $07million and $03million, respectively. 
The
Components of inventories were as follows in thousands: December 31 2004
2003 Raw Materials 4,973 2,203 Work in Process 684 1,487 Finished Goods 887 1,398 6,544 5,088 Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, and the cost is amortized over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, which range from three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the
term of the lease, whichever is shorter. 
Property
and equipment consisted of the following in thousands: December 31 2004
2003 in thousands Land 21 21 Building 447 415 Scientific equipment 4,178 2,761 Manufacturing equipment 6,906 5,911 Office furniture, computers and equip 3,464 3,157 Leasehold improvements 2,056 2,630 17,072 14,895 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization 7,316 6,824 9,756 8,071 55 
Intangible Assets 
As of December31, 2004, intangible assets consisted primarily of rights to certain patented technologies licensed from Applera Corporation and F.
Hoffmann-La RocheLtd. Roche, see Note4, Collaborative Agreements and Contracts. Amortization of intangible assets is included in cost of product sales in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company reviews its
intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. 
Intangible
assets are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 5 to 15years, on a
straight-line basis. 
Amortization
expense of intangible assets was $15million and zero for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The expected future annual amortization
expense of intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet as of December31, 2004 is as follows in thousands, assuming no impairment charges: For the Year Ending December 31, 
Amortization
Expense 2005 2,504 2006 2,504 2007 2,504 2008 2,504 2009 2,495 2010-2020 18,391 Total expected future annual amortization 30,902 Warranty Accrual 
The Company warrants its instrument products to be free from defects for a period of 12 to 15months from the date of sale for material and labor costs to
repair the product. Accordingly, a provision for the estimated cost of warranty repair is recorded at the time revenue is recognized. The Company
warranty accrual is established using management estimate for the future costs of repairing any instrument failures during the warranty period. As of December31, 2004 and 2003, the accrued
warranty liability was $04million and $03million, respectively. The activity in the warranty accrual for the year ended December31, 2004 consisted of the following in
thousands: 2004
2003 Balance at beginning of year 331 634 Costs incurred and charged against reserve 114 763 Provision for warranty 162 326 Provision for specific warranty repair 134 Balance at end of year 379 331 Revenue Recognition 
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales and contract arrangements. From time to time, the Company enters into revenue arrangements with multiple
deliverables. Multiple element revenue agreements entered into on or after July1, 2003 are evaluated under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No00-21, Revenue Arrangements
with Multiple Deliverables, to determine whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and whether objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered
item exists. Deliverables in an arrangement that do not 
56  meet
the separation criteria in Issue 00-21 must be treated as one unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition. Advance payments received in excess of amounts earned, such as
funds received in advance of technologies to be delivered or services to be performed, are classified as deferred revenue until earned. 
The
Company recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed and
determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. No right of return exists for the Company products except in the case of damaged goods. The Company has not experienced any significant returns
of the Company products. 
Contract
revenues include fees for technology licenses, research and development services and royalties under license and collaboration agreements and fees for services rendered under
research and development arrangements. Contract revenue related to technology licenses is generally fully recognized only after both the license period has commenced, the technology has been delivered
and no further involvement of the Company is required. For example, the $100million license execution fee from the bioMerieux collaboration in 2003 was deferred and is being amortized over
the period of approximately five years, which represents the estimated period of the Company continuing involvement under the collaboration agreement. Royalties are typically based on licensees' net
sales of products that utilize the Company technology, and royalty revenues are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when the royalties can be reliably measured and their
collectibility is reasonably assured, such as upon the receipt of a royalty statement from the customer. 
Grant
and government sponsored research revenue and contract revenue related to research and development services are recognized as the related services are performed based on the
performance requirements of the relevant contract. Under the agreements, the Company is required to perform specific research and development activities and is compensated based on the costs, or costs
plus a mark-up, associated with each specific contract over the term of the agreement. 
Research and Development 
Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for company-sponsored and collaborative research and development activities. These costs include
direct and research-related overhead expenses. Research and development expenses under collaborative agreements and government grants approximate the revenue recognized under such agreements. The
Company expenses research and development costs as such costs are incurred. 
Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company accounts for its employee stock option and stock purchase plans using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principle Board Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Accordingly, the Company does not recognize compensation expense for employee or director stock options granted not less than fair market
value. For purposes of disclosures pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, SFAS123, as amended by SFAS148,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure, the estimated fair value of options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The following table illustrates the
effect on net loss and net loss per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provision of SFAS123 to stock-based employee 
57  compensation
in thousands, except per share data. Pro forma amounts may not be representative of future periods. Year Ended December31 2004
2003
2002 Net loss as reported 13,800 17,531 19,741 Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation determined under the fair value method for all employee-related stock-based awards, net of tax related effects 5,539 3,371 3,338 Add: Amortization of deferred stock compensation 85 529 Pro forma net loss 19,339 20,817 22,550 Basic and diluted net loss per share As reported 034 053 070 Pro forma 047 062 080 The
fair value of these options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, with the following weighted-average assumptions: Year Ended December31 2004

5 The
same assumptions were applied in the determination of the option values related to stock options granted to non-employees, except the option life, for which the term of
the consulting contracts, 2years, was used. The value of stock options granted to non-employees has been recorded in the financial statements. 
The
weighted-average fair value of options granted during 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $655, $389, and $354, respectively. All options were granted with exercise prices which equaled the
fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. 
The
fair value option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management opinion, the existing
models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options. In
December2004, the Financial Accounting Standard Board FASB issued SFAS123R, Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of FASB Statement No123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS123R supersedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS No95, Statement of Cash Flows.
SFAS123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. The new rules
would be would be effective for the Company beginning July1, 2005. The Company is currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of SFAS123R related to
employee stock options. Current estimates of option 
58  values
using the Black-Scholes method as shown above may not be indicative of results from valuation methodologies ultimately adopted in the final rules. 
Comprehensive Income Loss 
Comprehensive loss includes net loss as well as other comprehensive income or loss. The Company other comprehensive income or loss consists of foreign currency
translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. Total comprehensive loss and the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss
are presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of shareholders' equity. Total accumulated other comprehensive income or loss is displayed as a separate component of shareholders' equity in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The activity in comprehensive loss during the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was as follows: Year Ended December31 2004
2003
2002 in thousands Net loss 13,800 17,531 19,741 Other comprehensive loss Change in foreign currency translation adjustments 122 17 4 Change in unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities 2 7 124 17 11 Comprehensive loss 13,924 17,548 19,730 Year Ended December31 2004
2003 Net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities 2 4 Cumulative translation adjustment 139 17 Accumulated other comprehensive loss 137 13 Net Loss Per Share 
Basic net loss per share has been calculated based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, less shares subject to the
Company right of repurchase. Common stock equivalents consisting of stock options and warrants calculated using the treasury stock method have been excluded from the computation of diluted net
loss per share, as their inclusion would be antidilutive for all periods presented.

all periods presented, the Company had securities outstanding which could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, but were excluded from the computation of
diluted net loss per share, as their effect would have been antidilutive. These outstanding securities consisted of the following in thousands, except per share data: Year Ended December31 2004

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In December2004, the Financial Accounting Standard Board FASB issued SFAS123R, Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of FASB Statement
No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS123R supersedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS No95, Statement
of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS123R is similar to the approach described in FASB Statement 123, SFAS123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including
grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. SFAS123R must be adopted no
later than July1, 2005. Early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued. We expect to adopt SFAS123R on July1, 2005. 
60  SFAS123R
permits public companies to adopt its requirement using one of two methods: 1A modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning
with the effective date abased on the requirements of SFAS123R for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and bbased on the requirements of
SFAS123R for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS123R that remain unvested on the effective date; or 2A modified retrospective method which
includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under Statement 123 for purposes of pro
forma disclosures either aall prior periods presented or bprior interim periods of the year of adoption. The Company plans to adopt SFAS123R using the modified prospective
method. 
As
permitted by SFAS123, the company currently accounts for share-based payments to employees using Opinion25 intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes
no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of Statement123R fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations, although it will
have no impact on our overall financial position. The amounts related to the adoption of Statement123R cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based
payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted Statement123R in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of Statement123 as described in
the disclosure of pro forma net loss and loss per share in Note1 to our consolidated financial statements. Statement123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of
recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows
and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. The Company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on, among other things, when employees
exercise stock options, and whether the Company will be in a taxable position. There is no tax impact related to the prior periods since the Company is in a net loss position. 
In
November2004, the FASB issued SFAS No151, Inventory Costs, an amendment to ARB No43, Chapter4, Inventory Pricing. SFAS No151 clarifies
treatment of abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage, specifying that such costs should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. The new statement
also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No151 is effective for inventory costs
incurred during fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005. Companies must apply the standard prospectively. We believe there will be no material effect upon adoption of this statement. 
2.Segment and Significant Concentrations 
The Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries operate in only one business segment. 
The
Company currently sells its products through its direct sales force and through third-party distributors. For the year ended December31, 2004, there were two direct customers
that represented 45% and 23% of total product sales. For the year ended December31, 2003, there was one direct customer that represented 11% of total product sales. For the year ended
December31, 2002, there was no one direct customer that represented greater than 10% of total product sales. The Company has distribution agreements with Fisher Scientific Company L.L.C. to
market the Cepheid SmartCycler system in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also has several regional distribution arrangements throughout Europe, Japan, South Korea, China, Mexico and other parts of
the world. Information 
61  about
sales through distributors for the three years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was as follows: Years Ended December31 2004

single country outside of the United States represented more than 10% of the Company total revenues in any period presented. No single country outside of the United States
represented 10% or more of the Company total net assets in any period presented. No single country outside of the United States represented more than 10% of the Company total net property, plant
and equipment in any period presented. 
Concentration of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of bank deposits and accounts receivable. The
Company maintains its portfolio of cash equivalents in short-term commercial paper, auction rate securities and money market funds. The Company accounts receivable are derived primarily
from sales to customers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains an allowance for potential doubtful accounts. 
As
of December31, 2004, there was one customer whose accounts receivable balance represents 69% of total accounts receivable. As of December31, 2003, there were two
customers who represented 31% and 21% of total accounts receivable, respectively. The
Company relies on several companies as its sole source for various materials used in its manufacturing process. Any extended interruption in the supply of these materials could
result in the failure to meet customer demand. 
3.Patent License Agreements 
In April2004, the Company entered into a patent license agreement with Applera Corporation, through ABI and its Celera Diagnostics joint venture, for a
non-exclusive worldwide license to make, use, and sell the Company products incorporating technology covered by Applera patents. The Company also entered into a patent license agreement
with F. Hoffmann-La RocheLtd. Roche, effective July1, 2004, for a non-exclusive worldwide license to make, use, and sell the Company products incorporating
technology covered by Roche patents. Under the license agreements, the Company agreed to pay aggregate license fees of $322million, of which $125million has been paid as of
December31, 2004, $110million will be paid in 2005, and $87million will be paid in 2006. In connection with the license agreements, the Company recorded intangible assets of
$311million, representing the present value of license fee obligations which is net of imputed interest of $11million. The intangible assets related to the Applera and Roche licenses
are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of approximately 10 and 15years, respectively, with the amortization recorded as part of the cost of product sales.
The Company also paid approximately $12million in back royalties related to the Applera license. This amount was expensed during the quarter ended March31, 2004. 
The
Company also agreed to pay Applera and Roche ongoing royalties on sales of any products incorporating the licensed patents. Resulting product royalties are recorded as part of the
cost of product sales when the related product sales are recognized. 
62  4.Collaboration Profit Sharing 
Collaboration profit sharing represents the amount that we pay to ABI under our collaboration agreement to develop reagents for use in the BDS developed for the
USPS. Under the agreement, computed gross margin on anthrax cartridge sales are shared equally between the two parties. As of December31, 2004 and 2003, the accrued profit sharing liability
was $31million and $03million, respectively. Collaboration profit sharing expense was $61million and $03million for the years ended December31, 2004 and
December31, 2003. The total revenues and cost of sales related to these cartridge sales is included in the respective balances in the statement of operations. 
5.Collaborative Agreements and Contracts 
bioMerieux,Inc. 
In December2003, the Company entered into an agreement with bioMerieux,Inc. for bioMerieux to develop DNA testing products using its proprietary
Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Amplification NASBA technology to be run on systems employing the Company GeneXpert platforms. Under the agreement, bioMerieux has paid the Company a
$100million license fee, and an additional $50million payment will become due when and if bioMerieux commercializes its first product based on our technology. The Company may also
receive potential product purchases and royalty payments on end-user GeneXpert test cartridge sales under the agreement. The $100million license fee received from bioMerieux was
deferred and is being amortized over the period of approximately five years, which represents the estimated period of our continuing involvement under this agreement. Infectio Diagnostics,Inc. 
In November2003, the Company entered into a series of new agreements with Infectio Diagnostics,Inc. IDI. Under the new agreements, the Company
joint venture with IDI, Aridia Corp., was dissolved. The joint venture was formed in February2000 and had not been funded and no amounts were incurred by or recorded by the joint venture
through the date of its dissolution in November2003. 
Under
the new agreements, the Company received non-exclusive worldwide, excluding Canada, distribution rights to IDI tests for group B streptococcus GBS, methicillin
resistant staphylococcus MRS and vancomycin resistant enterococcus VRE, that have been configured for use with the SmartCycler system. The Company also received a non-exclusive,
royalty-bearing license to apply IDI proprietary genetic sequences for GBS, MRSA and VRE in the development and commercialization of Cepheid tests to be used in the GeneXpert system. IDI received
non-exclusive worldwide rights to distribute the Company SmartCycler system for use with IDI tests. 
Applied Biosystems 
In October2002, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Applied Biosystems to develop reagents for use in the USPS BDS, which was developed by the
consortium led by Northrop Grumman Corporation. Under the agreement, reagents will be manufactured by Applied Biosystems for packaging by us into our GeneXpert test cartridges and sold by us for use
in the BDS. This agreement calls for the gross margin on sales of anthrax cartridges for the USPS BDS program to be equally shared between the two parties. 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory 
The Company has a worldwide exclusive license with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory LLNL to use or sublicense certain patent rights and to make, have
made, import, and use certain licensed products relating to the patent rights for the use of rapid thermal cycling technology with real 
63  time
optical detection for nucleic acid amplification. The Company paid LLNL an issuance fee of $02million for this technology in 1997. In addition, upon commercialization of any product
containing the licensed technology, including the SmartCycler system, the Company is required to pay royalties to LLNL based on net sales. 
6.Equipment and Building Financing 
The Company financed a portion of its equipment purchases under an equipment financing agreement with a financing company. As of December31, 2004 and
2003, the Company had financed $94million and $78million respectively, in equipment purchases under these agreements. The equipment loans are to be repaid over 36 to 48months
at interest rates ranging from 74% to 99% and are secured by the related equipment. As of December31, 2004, there was no remaining credit available under this agreement. 
In
December2002, the Company purchased land and a building for approximately $04million to be utilized by its wholly-owned French subsidiary, Cepheid SA. This purchase
was financed with a ten-year mortgage bearing interest at 475%. The mortgage was fully secured by the land and building purchased as well as a standby letter of credit in the amount of
$05million. The amount of the collateral for this standby letter of credit was classified as restricted cash at December31, 2002. In November2003, the Company repaid the
mortgage in full and the standby letter of credit was terminated accordingly. 
Future
minimum principal payments under the equipment financing arrangement at December31, 2004 are as follows inthousands: Year Ending December 31, 2005 2,092 2006 1,374 2007 315 Total minimum payments 3,781 Amount representing interest 288 Present value of future payments 3,493 Current portion of equipment financing 1,889 Non-current portion of equipment financing 1,604 7.Leases, Commitments and Contingencies 
Facility Lease 
The Company leases its headquarters facility under a ten-year operating lease, which expires on March18, 2012. The lease provides for a three
percent annual base rent increase. In connection with this lease agreement, the Company obtained an irrevocable standby letter of credit in the amount of $07million, collateralized by a
certificate of deposit. This certificate of deposit has been classified as restricted cash on the balance sheet as of December31, 2004 and 2003. 
64  Minimum
annual rental commitments under the operating leases at December31, 2004 are as follows in thousands: Year Ending December 31, 2005 1,435 2006 1,478 2007 1,522 2008 1,567 2009 1,615 Thereafter 3,757 Total minimum payments 11,374 Rent
expense for years ended December31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 was $15million, $15million, and $17million, respectively. 
Revolving Line of Credit 
In November2004, the Company entered into an agreement with a financial lending institution for a revolving line of credit totaling $40million of
which up to $20million may be used for letters of credit, which is collateralized by the Company accounts receivables and bears an annual interest rate equal to the lender prime rate. The
interest rate at December31, 2004 was 491%. The line of credit contains a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain at least a $50million balance in investments with
the lender and a minimum of $250million in unrestricted cash in total. The agreement contains a clause which indicates that if a material adverse event occurs, this could be considered to be
an event of default which may cause the amount due under the agreement to be paid before maturity. No such event has occurred as of December31, 2004. The line of credit expires in
November9, 2006, at which time any outstanding balance on the line of credit will be due. As of December31, 2004, we borrowed $40million under this line. 
8.Shareholders' Equity 
Common Stock 
Initial Public Offering.On June21, 2000, the Company completed its initial public offering of 5,000,000 shares of
common stock at a price of $600 per share. The offering resulted in net proceeds of approximately $268million. At the close of the offering, all issued and outstanding shares of the
Company preferred stock were converted into 13,326,636 shares of common stock. In July2000, the underwriters of the initial public offering exercised their over-allotment option
and purchased an additional 750,000 shares of the Company common stock, generating additional net proceeds of approximately $42million. 
Offerings under a Shelf Registration Statement.In December2001, the Company filed a shelf registration statement for
the issuance of up to $350million in debt and/or equity securities. Pursuant to this shelf registration statement, on August2, 2002, the Company completed the sale of 4,000,000 common
shares at $265 per share for net proceeds of approximately $95million. On March4, 2003, the Company completed the sale of 1,360,000 common shares at $369 per share for net proceeds
of approximately $47million. On August13, 2003, the Company completed the sale of 2,777,778 common shares of common stock at $360 per share for net proceeds of approximately
$92million. On November7, 2003, the Company completed another sale of 555,556 common shares, at $375 per share for net proceeds of approximately $20million, pursuant to an
option issued in connection with its common stock offering on August13, 2003. As of December31, 2004, the Company has approximately $73million still available for sale under
this shelf registration statement. 
65  Follow On Offerings.On February18, 2004, the Company completed an offering of 5,500,000 shares of common stock at a
price of $1125 per share. The offering resulted in net proceeds of approximately $577million. 
Warrants 
In connection with the SeriesB Preferred Stock offering in 1998, the Company issued warrants to purchase 274,797 shares of common stock at an exercise
price of $258 per share to the private placement agent for the SeriesB Preferred Stock financing. The warrants expired on April30, 2003. The warrants were exercisable immediately as
of the issue date of April22, 1998. Because these warrants were considered equity issuance costs at the time of issuance, no value was recorded since the net impact on shareholders' equity
would have been zero. There were 6,232 shares of common stock issued from these warrants exercised during 2003 and were included in common stock issued as of December31, 2003. As of
December31, 2004, there were no warrants outstanding to purchase the Company common stock. 
Stock Option Plan 
On April16, 1997, the Board of Directors approved a Stock Option Plan the Plan and initially reserved 2,000,000 shares for issuance thereunder. In
January2000 and June2001, the Board of Directors and the shareholders approved amendments to reserve an additional 800,000 shares and 1,875,000 shares, respectively, for issuance under
the Plan. The Plan provides for annual increases in the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan on the first business day of each year, beginning January1, 2001, equal to the
lesser of 1,000,000 shares, 30% of the outstanding shares on the date of the annual increase or such amount as may be determined by the Board. In January2003, an additional 927,782 shares
were reserved for issuance under this provision. In May2003, the shareholders approved an amendment to terminate the 2000 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan the Directors'
Plan and reserve for issuance under the 1997 Plan the 200,000 shares previously available for issuance under the Directors' Plan. As of December31, 2004, a total of 8,395,867 shares were
authorized for issuance under the Plan and 671,755 shares remain available for future grant. 
Under
the Plan, as amended, incentive stock options may be granted to employees, and nonstatutory stock options may be granted to employees, directors and consultants. Options are
granted at an exercise price of no less than the fair market value per share of the common stock on the date of grant and expire not later than ten years from the date of grant. Options under the Plan
generally vest 25% one year after the date of grant and then on a pro rata basis over the following 36months. Pursuant
to the Change of Control Retention and Severance Agreements between the Company and its executives, in the event of an executive termination upon a change of control, all of
the executive outstanding stock options granted by the Company to the executive prior to the change of control shall become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the effective date of
the termination upon a change of control. Approximately 10million shares of the executive options outstanding were remeasured at various dates in 2003 and 2002, the dates of the modification,
for the change in control provision. Such remeasured shares, if outstanding at the time of a change in control, would result in additional stock-based compensation recorded at that time. The amount of
such additional stock-based compensation would not be significant.

2,668,701 436 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
The 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan was adopted in April2000 and amended in June2003. The Purchase Plan permits eligible
employees of the Company and its participating subsidiaries to purchase common stock at a discount up to a maximum of 15% of compensation through payroll deductions during defined offering periods.
The price at which stock is purchased under the Purchase Plan is equal to 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or last day of the offering period, whichever is lower. The
number of shares available for issuance under the plan is 97,200 plus an annual increase equal to the lesser of 200,000 shares, 075% 
67  of
the outstanding shares on the date of the annual increase or a lesser amount determined by the Board. As of December31, 2004, a total of 998,183 shares of the Company common stock have
been authorized under the Purchase Plan and 900,983 shares have been issued. Stock-Based Compensation 
During the years ended December31, 2000 and 1999, in connection with stock option grants to employees and directors, deferred stock compensation was
recorded totaling $69million representing the difference between the deemed fair value of the common stock for financial reporting purposes and the exercise price of the underlying options.
This amount is recorded as a reduction of shareholders' equity and is being amortized over the vesting period of the individual options, generally four years. In 2002 and 2001, certain employees were
terminated whose original option grants resulted in the recognition of deferred stock-based compensation. The related unamortized deferred stock-based compensation was reversed from additional
paid-in capital and deferred stock-based compensation. The Company recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of zero, $85,000, and $529,000 for the years ended
December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
During
the years ended December31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, the Company granted nonqualified options to purchase 17,000, 4,800, and 9,600, shares of common stock respectively, to
consultants at exercise prices that range from $012 to $918 per share for services rendered, respectively. Such options are included in the option tables disclosed above. These options generally
vest over two years and have expiration dates, which range from the end of the term of the consulting agreements to ten years after the grant date. Expense of approximately $16,000, $14,000, and
$12,000 was recognized in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to these grants.

5,715 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan 
In March2000, the Company adopted the 2000 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan and reserved a total of 200,000 shares of common stock
for issuance thereunder. Each non-employee director who becomes a director of the Company will be automatically granted a nonstatutory stock option to purchase 15,000 shares of common
stock on the date on which such person first becomes a director. At the first board meeting following each annual shareholders meeting, beginning with the first board meeting after the first annual
shareholders' meeting, each non-employee director then in office for over six months will automatically be granted a nonstatutory option to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock. The
exercise price of options under the Directors' Plan will be equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. The term of these options is 10years. 
In
May2003, the Directors' Plan was terminated pursuant to the Amendments to the 1997 Stock Option Plan approved by the Board and the shareholders. Upon the termination of the
Directors' Plan, no further options will be granted under the Directors' Plan, and all shares then reserved for issuance 
68  under
the Directors' Plan that are not subject to outstanding options granted under the Directors' Plan will instead become reserved and available for issuance under the 1997 Plan. Options and shares
granted or issued under the Directors' Plan that were outstanding on the date the Directors' Plan was terminated will remain subject to the terms of the Directors' Plan. After the Directors' Plan was
terminated, any shares subject to options issued under the Directors' Plan that cease to be subject to the options for any reason other than option exercise, and any shares issued under the Directors'
Plan that are repurchased by us or forfeited, become available for grant under the 1997 Plan. Under the amendment, new non-employee directors will receive nondiscretionary, automatic
grants of options to purchase 15,000 shares of the Company common stock upon joining the Board and the continuing non-employee directors will receive nondiscretionary, automatic grants
of options to purchase 7,500 shares of common stock each year after the annual meeting of shareholders. 
9.Employee Benefit Plan 
Effective January1, 1998, the Company adopted a 401k plan that allows eligible employees to contribute a percentage of their qualified compensation
subject to IRS limits. The Company has the discretion to make matching contributions each year. For each of the three years ended December31, 2004, the Company did not make any matching
contributions. 
10.Income Taxes 
The Company has no provision for U.S. federal, state, or foreign income taxes for any period as it has incurred operating losses in all periods and for all
jurisdictions. 
As
of December31, 2004, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $794million, which expire in the years 2011
through 2024, and federal research and development tax credits of approximately $17 million, which expire in the years 2012 through 2024. Utilization
of the net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
and similar state
provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization. Significant components of the Company deferred tax assets are as follows in
thousands: December 31 2004
2003 Net operating loss carryforwards 28,893 22,390 Capitalized research and development costs 2,627 3,000 Research and other credit carryforwards 3,016 2,440 Accruals and Reserves 414 260 Othernet 1,956 3,770 Total deferred tax assets 36,906 31,860 Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 36,906 31,860 Net deferred tax assets Because
of the Company lack of earnings history, the deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance increased by approximately
