Item8.Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT To the Stockholders of Network Appliance, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Network Appliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries
the Company as of April30, 2003 and 2002,
and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders equity and comprehensive income and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
April30, 2003. Our audits also included the consolidated
financial statement schedule listed in Item14a2. These
financial statements and the financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
statements and the financial statement schedule based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Network Appliance, Inc. and its
subsidiaries as of April30, 2003 and 2002, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended April30, 2003 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also, in our opinion, the consolidated financial
statement schedule listed in Item14a2, when considered
in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein. As discussed in Note 13, effective May1,
2002, the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill
and other intangible assets to conform to Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP San Jose, California May9, 2003 May13, 2003 as to Note 15 42 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS In thousands, except pershare

Significant Accounting Policies Fiscal
Year We operate on a
52-week or 53-week year ending on the last Friday in April. For
presentation purposes we have indicated in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements that our fiscal year end is
April30. Fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 were 52-week fiscal
years. Basis of
Presentation The
consolidated financial statements include the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts
from prior years have been reclassified to conform to
current-year presentation. These reclassifications did not
change previously reported total assets, liabilities,
stockholders equity or net income. Cash and Cash
Equivalents We consider
all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. Short-Term
Investments
Available-for-sale investments with original maturities of
greater than three months are classified as short-term
investments, as these investments generally consist of highly
marketable securities that are intended to be available to meet
current cash requirements. All of our investments are classified
as available-for-sale, which are carried at fair market value,
and unrealized gains or losses recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive loss, which is a separate component of
stockholders equity, net of taxes. Any gains or losses on
sales of investments are computed based upon specific
identification. For all periods presented, realized gains and
losses on available-for-sale investments were not material.
Management determines the appropriate classification of debt and
equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the
classification at each reporting date. Available-for-sale
investments are reviewed for evidence of reductions in market
value that are other than temporary. We perform periodic reviews
of our investments for impairment. Our investments in publicly
held companies are generally considered impaired when a decline
in the fair value of an investment as measured by quoted market
prices is less than its carrying value and such a decline is not
considered temporary. During fiscal 2003 and 2002, we recorded a
noncash, other-than-temporary write-down of $726 and $3,641,
respectively, related to impairment of our investments in
publicly traded companies. These write-downs are included in net
loss on investments on the income statement. No write-downs were
recorded during fiscal 2001. Investments in Nonpublic
Companies We have certain
investments in nonpublicly traded companies in which we have
less than 20% of the voting rights and in which we do not
exercise significant influence. As of April30, 2003 and
2002, $909 and $1,724 of these investments are included in other
long-term assets on the balance sheet and are carried at cost.
We perform periodic reviews of our investments for impairment.
Our investments in privately held companies are considered
impaired when a review of the investees operations and
other indicators of impairment indicate that the carrying value
of the investment is not likely to be recoverable. Such
indicators include, but are not limited to, limited capital
resources, limited prospects of 47 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued receiving additional financing, and limited
prospects for liquidity of the related securities. During fiscal
2002, we recorded a noncash, other-than-temporary write-down of
$9,367 related to impairments of our investments in private
companies. No write-downs were recorded during fiscal 2003 and
2001. During fiscal 2003, we sold shares of certain privately
held investments and realized a net loss of $503. Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out
basis or market. Property and
Equipment Property and
equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, which generally range from three to five years. The land
at the Sunnyvale headquarters site acquired in April 2002 is not
being depreciated. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the
remaining term of the lease. Building improvements are amortized
over the estimated lives of the assets, which generally range
from ten to forty years. Construction in progress will be
amortized over the estimated useful lives of the respective
assets when they are ready for their intended use. We review the carrying values of long-lived
assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net
book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected
future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition. The
amount of impairment loss, if any, is measured as the difference
between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the
asset. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible
Assets Goodwill and
purchased intangible assets include goodwill and other
intangible assets such as existing workforce and existing
technology, which are carried at cost less accumulated
amortization. For business combinations consummated before
July1, 2001, goodwill and existing workforce were
amortized through April30, 2002 using the straight-line
method over an estimated useful life of three to five years.
Amortization of other purchased intangibles is computed using
the straight-line method over the expected useful life of three
to five years. We evaluate the impairment of goodwill and
purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. See Note13 Goodwill and
Purchased Intangible Assets. Revenue Recognition and
Allowance We apply the
provisions of SOP97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, and related interpretations to all
revenue transactions. We recognize revenue when   
Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists.
It is our customary practice to have a
purchase order prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement.
Delivery has Occurred.
Our product is physically delivered to
our customers, generally with standard transfer terms as FOB
shipping point. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or
return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria
are achieved. If undelivered products or services exist that are
essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an
arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred.
The Fee is Fixed or Determinable.
Arrangements with payment terms
extending beyond our standard terms and condition practices are
not considered to be fixed or determinable. Revenue from such
arrangements is recognized as the fees become due and payable.
Collection is Probable.
Probability of collection is assessed
on a customer-by-customer basis. Customers are subjected to a
credit review process that evaluates the customers
financial position and ultimately their ability to pay. If it is
determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection is
not probable based upon our review process, revenue is
recognized upon cash receipt.
For arrangements with multiple elements, we
allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based
on vendor specific objective evidence of the undelivered items.
We defer the portion of the arrangement fee equal to the fair
value of the undelivered elements until they are delivered.
Vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged
when the element is sold separately. 48 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued A typical arrangement includes product, software
subscription, and maintenance. Some arrangements include
training and consulting. Software subscriptions include
unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a
when-and-if-available basis, bug fixes, and patch releases, and
are included in product revenues. Service maintenance includes
contracts for technical support and hardware maintenance.
Revenue from software subscriptions and service is recognized
ratably over the contractual term, generally one to three years.
Revenue from training and consulting is recognized as the
services are performed. The following table presents the components of
revenues, stated as a percentage of total revenues

We record reductions to revenue for estimated
sales returns at the time of shipment. These estimates are based
on historical sales returns, changes in customer demand, and
other factors. If actual future returns and allowances differ
from past experience, additional allowances may be required. We also maintain a separate allowance for
doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of our customers to make required payments. We analyze
accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer
concentrations, customer solvency, current economic and
geographic trends, and changes in customer payment terms and
practices when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for
doubtful accounts. If the financial condition of our customers
deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to
make payments, additional allowances may be required. Software Development
Costs The costs for the
development of new software products and substantial
enhancements to existing software products are expensed as
incurred until technological feasibility has been established,
at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in
accordance with SFAS No86, Accounting for the
Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
Marketed. Because we believe our current process for
developing software is essentially completed concurrently with
the establishment of technological feasibility, which occurs
upon the completion of a working model, no costs have been
capitalized for any of the periods presented. In accordance with
SOP98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, the
cost of internally-developed software is capitalized and
included in property and equipment at the point at which the
conceptual formulation, design and testing of possible software
project alternatives have been completed and management
authorizes and commits to funding the project. Pilot projects
and projects where expected future economic benefits are less
than probable are not capitalized. Internally-developed software
costs include the cost of software tools and licenses used in
the development of our systems, as well as consulting costs.
Completed projects are transferred to property and equipment at
cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives, generally three years. Foreign Currency
Translation For
subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency,
gains and losses resulting from translation of these foreign
currency financial statements into U.S.dollars are
recorded within stockholders equity as part of accumulated
other comprehensive loss. For subsidiaries where the functional
currency is the U.S.dollar, gains and losses resulting
from the process of remeasuring foreign currency financial
statements into U.S.dollars are included in other income. 49 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued In fiscal 2002, we determined that the functional
currency of one of our subsidiaries had changed from the Euro to
the U.S.Dollar. Accordingly, all monetary assets and
liabilities were translated at the current exchange rate in
effect as of the balance sheet date, nonmonetary assets and
liabilities were translated at historical rates, and total
revenues and expenses were translated at average exchange rates
in effect during the period. Transaction gains and losses are
included in other income expense in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. Derivative
Instruments We adopted
SFAS133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities. Derivatives that are not
designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through
earnings. If the derivative is designated as a hedge, depending
on the nature of the exposure being hedged, changes in fair
value will either be offset against the change in fair value of
the hedged asset or liability through earnings, or recognized in
other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized
in earnings. The ineffective portion of the hedge is recognized
in earnings immediately. The adoption of this accounting
standard did not have a significant impact on our financial
position, results of operations, or cash flow. As a result of our significant international
operations, we are subject to risks associated with fluctuating
exchange rates. We use derivative financial instruments,
principally currency forward contracts, to attempt to minimize
the impact of exchange rate movements on our balance sheet
relating to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and
operating results. We do not enter into derivative financial
instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Currently, we
do not enter into any foreign exchange forward contracts to
hedge exposures related to firm commitments or equity
investments. Our major foreign currency exchange exposures and
related hedging programs are described below Balance Sheet. We utilize currency forward
contracts to hedge currency exchange rate fluctuations related
to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. Gains and
losses on these undesignated derivatives offset gains and losses
on the assets and liabilities being hedged and the net amount is
included in earnings. In fiscal 2003, net gains generated by
hedged assets and liabilities totaled $9,910, which were offset
by losses on the related derivative instruments of $10,932. In
fiscal 2002, net gains generated by hedged assets and
liabilities totaled $1,684, which were offset by losses on the
related derivative instruments of $3,485. In fiscal 2001, net
losses generated by hedged assets and liabilities totaled
$2,250, which were offset by gains on the related derivative
instruments of $3,898. Forecasted transactions. We use currency forward
contracts to hedge exposures related to forecasted sales and
operating expenses denominated in Euros and British Pounds.
These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges when the
transactions are forecasted and in general closely match the
underlying forecasted transactions in duration. The contracts
are carried on the balance sheet at fair value and the effective
portion of the contracts gains and losses is recorded as
other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction
occurs. If the underlying forecasted transactions do not
occur, or it becomes probable that they will not occur, the gain
or loss on the related cash flow hedge is recognized immediately
in other income. During fiscal 2003, we did not record any gains
or losses related to forecasted transactions that did not occur
or became improbable. We measure the effectiveness of hedges of
forecasted transactions on at least a quarterly basis by
comparing the fair values of the designated currency forward
contracts with the fair values of the forecasted transactions.
No ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings during fiscal 2003. Use of
Estimates The preparation
of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America requires management to establish
accounting policies which contain estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. 50 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Concentration of Credit
Risk Financial instruments
which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk
consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments,
and accounts receivable. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments consist primarily of U.S.government agencies,
corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, cash accounts held at
various banks, and money market funds held at several financial
institutions. We sell our products primarily to large
organizations in different industries and geographies. Credit
risk is mitigated by our credit evaluation process and limited
payment terms. We do not require collateral or other security to
support accounts receivable. In addition, we maintain an
allowance for potential credit losses. In entering into forward
foreign exchange contracts, we have assumed the risk that might
arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the
terms of their contracts. The counterparties to these contracts
are major multinational commercial banks, and we do not expect
any losses as a result of counterparty defaults. Comprehensive
Income Comprehensive
income is defined as the change in equity during a period from
non-owner sources. Comprehensive income for the years ending
April30, 2003, 2002, and 2001 has been disclosed within
the consolidated statement of stockholders equity and
comprehensive income. The components of accumulated other comprehensive

share is computed by dividing income available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for that period. Diluted net income per share is
computed giving effect to all dilutive potential shares that
were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common
shares consist of incremental common shares subject to
repurchase and common shares issuable upon exercise of stock
options. 51 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Compensation We account
for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions
of APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and comply with the disclosure provisions of
SFASNo123 as amended by SFAS148,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Transition and Disclosures. Deferred compensation recognized
under APBNo25 is amortized to expense using the
graded vesting method. We account for stock options issued to
non-employees in accordance with the provisions of
SFASNo123 and EITFNo96-18 under the
fair value based method. We adopted the disclosure-only provisions of
SFAS123, and accordingly, no expense has been recognized
for options granted to employees under the various Plans. We
amortize deferred stock-based compensation on the graded vesting
method over the vesting periods of the applicable stock purchase
rights and stock options, generally four years. The graded
vesting method provides for vesting of portions of the overall
awards at interim dates and results in greater vesting in
earlier years than the straight-line method. Had compensation
expense been determined based on the fair value at the grant
date for awards, consistent with 52 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

During the preparation of the Companys
fiscal 2003 consolidated financial statements, management
determined that the pro forma net loss and the pro forma net
loss per share for fiscal 2002 and 2001 for purposes of
recording compensation for stock-based awards to employees under
SFAS123 for disclosure purposes did not include the
add-back of the APB25 stock compensation expense and
accordingly such amounts have been reflected. These changes did
not impact the Companys consolidated balance sheet,
consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of
stockholders equity and comprehensive income and
consolidated statements of cash flow for any of the periods
presented. The fair value of each option grant is estimated
on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model, and is not subject to revaluation as a result of
subsequent stock price fluctuations. The following

The Black-Scholes option pricing model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
addition, option pricing models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price
volatility. We use projected volatility rates, which are based
upon historical volatility rates since our initial public
offering, trended into future years. Because our employee stock
options have characteristics significantly different from those
of traded options and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
managements opinion, the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value
of our options. 53 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Recently Issued Accounting
Standards In June 2002,
FASB issued SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which
addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs. SFAS
No146 supersedes previous accounting guidance,
principally EITF Issue No94-3. The Company adopted the
provisions of SFAS No146 for restructuring activities
initiated after December31, 2002. SFAS No146
requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or
disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred.
Under EITF Issue No94-3, a liability for an exit cost was
recognized at the date of the Companys commitment to an
exit plan. SFAS No146 also establishes that the liability
should initially be measured and recorded at fair value.
Accordingly, SFAS No146 may affect the timing of
recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts
recognized. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others FIN45.
FIN45 requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair
value and requires a guarantor to make disclosures, even when
the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is
remote. For those guarantees and indemnifications that do not
fall within initial recognition and measurement requirements of
FIN45, the Company must continue to monitor the conditions
that are subject to the guarantees and indemnifications, as
required under existing generally accepted accounting
principles, to identify if a loss has been incurred. If the
Company determines that it is probable that a loss has been
incurred, any such estimable loss would be recognized. The
initial recognition and measurement requirements do not apply to
the Companys product warranties or to the provisions
contained in the majority of the Companys software license
agreements that indemnify licensees of the Companys
software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging
that the Companys software infringes the intellectual
property rights of a third party. The Company has provided
disclosures for the year ended April30, 2003 as required
by FIN45 in Note 14 to its consolidated financial
statements. The Company does not expect adoption of the
liability recognition provisions to have a material impact on
its financial position or results of operations. In December 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on
EITF00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables. This issue addresses certain aspects of
the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will
perform multiple revenue-generating activities. In some
arrangements, the different revenue-generating activities
deliverablesare sufficiently separable and there exists
sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account
for some or all of the deliverables that is, there are separate
units of accounting. In other arrangements, some or all of the
deliverables are not independently functional, or there is not
sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them
separately. This issue addresses when and, if 54 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued so, how an arrangement involving multiple
deliverables should be divided into separate units of
accounting. This issue does not change otherwise applicable
revenue recognition criteria. The guidance in this issue is
effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal
periods beginning after June15, 2003. The Company does not
expect that the adoption of EITF00-21 will have a material
effect on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS148,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Transition and Disclosure, an amendment to FASB Statement
123. SFAS148 provides alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method
of accounting of stock-based employee compensation. In addition,
SFAS148 amends the disclosure requirements of
SFAS123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, to require prominent disclosures in both
annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect
of the method used on reported results. The Company adopted the
disclosure provisions of SFAS148 effective April30,
2003. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation
No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities. FIN46 requires an investor with a
majority of the variable interests in a variable interest entity
to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and
significant variable interest investors to provide certain
disclosures. A variable interest entity is an entity in which
the equity investors do not have a controlling interest or the
equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the
entitys activities without receiving additional
subordinated financial support from the other parties. The
Company does not expect to identify any variable interest
entities that must be consolidated. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No149,
Amendment of SFAS No133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No149
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No133.
In particular, this Statement clarifies under what circumstances
a contract with an initial net investment meets the
characteristic of a derivative. It also clarifies when a
derivative contains a financing component that warrants special
reporting in the statement of cash flows. SFAS No149 is
generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June30, 2003 and is not expected to have an impact on the
Company upon adoption. In May 2003, the FASB has issued SFAS
No150, Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity. The Statement improves the accounting for
certain financial instruments that, under previous guidance,
issuers could account for as equity. The new Statement requires
that those instruments be classified as liabilities in
statements of financial position. This statement is effective
for interim periods beginning after June15, 2003. The
Company is currently evaluating the effect of this statement on
its consolidated financial statement. The Company does not
expect that the adoption of SFAS 150 will have a material effect
on its consolidated financial statements. 55 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

4.Commitments
and Contingencies In fiscal 2002, we terminated our operating lease
obligations for our Sunnyvale headquarters site by purchasing
the land and buildings for $249,840. As a result of headcount
reductions in fiscal 2002, we are not currently utilizing
certain existing spaces at our California headquarters site.
Additionally, we have also exited office spaces under
non-cancellable leases in other locations both in the
U.S.and Europe. If we are unable to successfully sublease
our vacated and unoccupied office space under operating leases,
our operating results may be adversely affected. See
Note12: Restructuring Charges. We lease other sales offices and research and
development facilities throughout the U.S.and
internationally. These sales offices are also leased under
operating leases which expire through fiscal 2019. We are
responsible for certain maintenance costs, taxes, and insurance
under these leases. The aggregate annual minimum rent commitment
under our operating leases is included in the minimum annual
lease payments schedule below. Future minimum annual lease payments as of
April30, 2003, are as follows

respectively. Rent expense under certain of our facility leases
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease. The difference between the amounts paid and the amounts
expensed is classified as long-term obligations in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In the past, we entered into agreements and
established Network Appliance accounts with Deutsche Banc Alex.
Brown whereby we had the option to guarantee any defaults of
certain margin loans made to two corporate officers by the
financial institution on their Network Appliance stock. In the
past, we also entered into an agreement and established a
Network Appliance account with Goldman, Sachs and Co. whereby we 57 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued had the option to guarantee any default of a
certain margin loan made to a third corporate officer by the
financial institution on his Network Appliance stock. The amount
of the guarantee was limited to the excess, if any, of the
amount of such loans over the fair market value of the Network
Appliance stock securing the loans. As of August26, 2002,
these accounts with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and Goldman, Sachs
and Co. were closed. In May 2000, we entered into a split dollar
insurance arrangement with our CEO. Under the arrangement, we
will pay the annual premiums on several insurance policies on
the life of the survivor of our CEO and his wife, and our CEO
will reimburse us each year for a portion of those premiums
equal to the economic value of the term insurance coverage
provided him under the policies. For each of the 2001, 2002 and
2003 fiscal years, we paid an aggregate net annual premium on
these split dollar polices in the amount of $2,050. Under the
arrangement, we will be reimbursed for all premium payments made
on those policies, and it is intended that we will be reimbursed
not later than May 2005. Upon the death of both our CEO and his
wife or any earlier cash-out of the policies, we will be
entitled to a refund of all cumulative premiums paid on these
policies by us, and the balance will be paid to our CEO or his
designated beneficiaries. The arrangement is terminable by us
upon thirty 30-days prior notice, and such termination will
trigger a refund of the net cumulative premiums paid by us on
the policies. From time to time, we have committed to purchase
various key components used in the manufacture of our products.
Our loss accrual for such commitments to these key component
vendors is based on our current forecasts of inventory usage. We
establish accruals for estimated losses on purchased components
for which we believe it is probable that they will not be
utilized in future operations. To the extent that such forecasts
are not achieved, our commitments and associated accruals may
change. We are subject to various legal proceedings and
claims which may arise in the normal course of business. We do
not believe that any current litigation or claims will have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or
financial condition. 5.Line of
Credit In July 1998, we negotiated a $5,000 unsecured
revolving credit facility with a domestic commercial bank. Under
terms of the credit facility, which expires in December 2003, we
must maintain various financial covenants. Any borrowings under
this agreement bear interest at either LIBOR plus 1% or at the
lenders prime lending rate, such rate
determined at our discretion. As of April30, 2003, the
amounts outstanding under this line of credit amounted to $1,194
relating to workers compensation and a foreign lease. We also have foreign exchange facilities used for
hedging arrangements with several banks that allow us to enter
into foreign exchange contracts of up to $125,000, of which
$7,484 was available at April30, 2003. 6.Stockholders
Equity Preferred
Stock Our Board of
Directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000shares of
preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences,
privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, of those
shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. Stock Option
Plans We adopted the 1993
Stock Option/ Stock Issuance Plan the 1993 Plan in
April 1993. In September 1995, we adopted the 1995 Stock
Incentive Plan the 1995 Plan. The 1995 Plan
replaced the 1993 Plan and provides for the grant of options and
the issuance of common stock under terms substantially the same
as those provided under the 1993 Plan, except that the 1995 Plan
does not allow for the exercise of options prior to vesting.
Accordingly, all options and shares issued under the 1993 Plan
were incorporated into the 1995 Plan upon the effectiveness of
our initial public offering. 58 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Under the 1995 Plan, the Board of Directors may
grant to employees, directors and consultants options to
purchase shares of our common stock. The exercise price for an
incentive stock option and a nonqualified stock option cannot be
less than 100% and 85%, respectively, of the fair market value
of our common stock as determined by the Board of Directors on
the date of grant. Options granted under the 1995 Plan generally
vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting
commencement date and then ratably over the following
36months. Options expire as determined by the Board of
Directors, but not more than ten years after the date of grant. In April 1997, the Board of Directors adopted the
Special Non-officer Stock Option Plan the Non-officer
Plan which provides for the grant of options and the
issuance of common stock under terms substantially the same as
those provided under the 1995 Plan, except that the Non-officer
Plan allows only for the issuance of nonqualified options to
non-officer employees. In August 1999, the Board of Directors adopted
the 1999 Stock Option Plan the 1999 Plan, which is
comprised of two separate equity incentive programs:
ithe Discretionary Option Grant Program under which
options may be granted to eligible individuals during the
service period at a fixed price per share and iithe
Automatic Option Grant Program under which nonemployee board
members will automatically receive special option grants at
designated intervals over their period of board service. The 1999 Plan will supplement the existing 1995
Plan and Non-officer Plan and those plans will continue to
remain in full force and effect until all available shares have
been issued under each such plan. However, the Automatic Option
Grant Program previously in effect under the 1995 Plan
terminated as of October26, 1999, and all automatic option
grants made to nonemployee board members on or after that date
will be made under the 1999 Plan. Under the 1999 Plan, the Board of Directors may
grant to employees, directors and consultants and other
independent advisors options to purchase shares of our common
stock during their period of service with us. The exercise price
for an incentive stock option and a nonstatutory option cannot
be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock
on the grant date. Options granted under the 1999 Plan generally
vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting
commencement date and then ratably over the following
36months. Options will have a term of ten years after the
date of grant, subject to earlier termination upon the
occurrence of certain events. In fiscal 2003, the 1999 plan was
amended to increase the share reserve by an additional 14,000
shares of common stock and effect certain changes to the
Automatic Option Grant Program in effect for the nonemployee
members of the Board of Directors. Options granted under the 1999 Plan are subject
to the cancellation/ regrant program with the following
limitations: ionly options held by employees who are
neither executive officers nor members of the board can be
repriced; and iithe total number of repriced options
will not exceed 10% of the total number of shares of common
stock authorized for issuance under the 1999 Plan. In fiscal 2001, we assumed various stock option
plans in connection with our Orca and WebManage acquisitions.
Pursuant to the provisions of the merger agreements, outstanding
shares were exchanged under certain exchange ratios in effect at
the time of each merger. Options granted under these plans
generally vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the
vesting commencement date and then ratably over the following
36months. Options expire as determined by the Board of
Directors, but not more than ten years after the date of grant. 59 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

60 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Employee Stock Purchase
Plan Under the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, employees are entitled
to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the fair market
value at certain specified dates. In fiscal 2003, the plan was
amended to increase the share reserve by an additional 2,400
shares of common stock. Of the 13,600 shares authorized to be
issued under this plan, 5,156 shares were available for issuance
at April30, 2003, 1,414, 1,094, and 448 shares were issued
in fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively, at a weighted
average price of $1074, $1460, and $2796 respectively. Deferred Stock
Compensation We recorded
$1,171, $1,301, and $14,127 of deferred compensation in fiscal
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, primarily related to the
recognition of stock compensation of unvested options assumed in
the WebManage acquisition, and the grant of stock options to
certain highly compensated employees. We reversed $1,612, $5,381
and $34 of deferred compensation in fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001,
respectively, due to employee terminations. The reversals were
primarily related to the forfeiture of unvested options assumed
in the WebManage acquisition as a result of employee
terminations. Under terms of the 1995 Stock Option Plan, highly
compensated employees as defined by our management are eligible
to contribute between $15 and $75 in annual salary for the
rights to be granted nonqualified stock options. The discount
from fair market value, which is equal to the amount of salary
contributed, has been recorded as deferred stock compensation
expense. The deferred compensation expense is amortized ratably
over a one-year period. Estimated future deferred stock compensation
amortization relating to assumed WebManage unvested options and
deferred salary investment options for fiscal 2004 are expected
to be $1,187. For fiscal 2005, estimated future stock
compensation amortization expenses are $176 and none thereafter. Under terms of the acquisition agreement with
Orca, we released shares of common stock to former Orca
shareholders upon Orcas meeting certain performance
criteria. The fair market values of these shares were measured
on the date the performance criteria were met and were
recognized as stock compensation. During fiscal 2003 and 2002,
we released an additional 99 and 165 shares of common stock,
respectively, valued in the aggregate at $921 and $3,015,
respectively. There are no additional performance milestones
remaining. We recorded $748 in compensation expense in
fiscal2003 for the fair value of options granted to a
member of the Board of Directors in recognition for services
performed outside of the normal capacity of a board member. The
100 common shares under the 1999 Plan were granted at an
exercise price of $1572 per share, the fair market value per
share on the grant date. The option has a term of 10years
measured from the grant date, subject to earlier termination
following his cessation of board service, and will vest in a
series of 48successive equal monthly installments upon his
completion of each month of board service over the 48month
period measured from the grant date. In fiscal 2003, we reached a final settlement of
the escrow fund arrangement under the WebManage acquisition
agreement. We have determined the total amount of our losses
under the settlement arrangement and 11 restricted shares were
released from the escrow and delivered to Network Appliance,
valued in the aggregate at $1,210 based on the fair market value
of our common stock as of the date of the acquisition.
Accordingly, an adjustment was made to the cost of the WebManage
acquisition. The balance of the escrow shares has been
distributed to former shareholders of WebManage in proportion to
their share ownership in WebManage, as provided in the original
merger agreement. In fiscal 2001, under terms of the acquisition
agreement with WebManage, we issued an additional 101 shares of
common stock to former WebManage stockholders upon
WebManages meeting certain performance criteria. The fair
market value of the shares of $3,000 was measured on the date
the performance criteria were met and was recognized as stock
compensation. 61 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTSContinued We do not use derivative financial instruments
for speculative or trading purposes. We enter into forward
foreign exchange contracts to hedge trade and intercompany
receivables and payables as well as future sales and operating
expenses against future movement in foreign exchange rates. The forward foreign exchange contracts require us
to exchange foreign currencies for U.S. dollars or vice versa
and generally mature in less than one year. As of April30,
2003, we had $117,468 of outstanding foreign exchange contracts
in Australian Dollars, British Pounds, Swiss Francs, Canadian
Dollars and European Currency Units, that had remaining
maturities of five months or less. For the balance sheet hedges,
these contracts are adjusted to fair value at the end of each
month and are included in other income expense, net. For the
cash flow hedges, the related gains or losses are included in
other comprehensive income. As of April30, 2002, we had
$90,459 of outstanding foreign exchange contracts in Australian
Dollars, British Pounds, Swiss Francs and European Currency
Units, that had remaining maturities of one month or less. These
foreign exchange contracts are adjusted to the fair value at the
end of every month and are included in other income expense,
net. Gains and losses on these foreign exchange contracts are
offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and
liabilities. At April30, 2003 and 2002, the estimated fair
values of forward foreign exchange contracts were $117,516 and
$90,603, respectively. Unrealized gains or losses on foreign
exchange contracts were not significant at April30, 2003.
The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is based on
prevailing financial market information. Other than foreign
exchange contracts, we have not entered into any other material
financial derivative instruments. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments and restricted cash reported in the
consolidated balance sheets approximate their carrying value.
The fair value of short-term investments and foreign exchange
contracts is based on quoted market prices. Other investments in
equity securities comprise investments in companies in the
volatile high-technology market.   
10.
Employee Benefit Plan We have established a 401k tax-deferred savings
plan Savings Plan. Employees meeting the
eligibility requirements, as defined, may contribute specified
percentages of their salaries. We contributed $1,315, $1,235 and
$1,109 for fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. 11. Acquisitions In June 2000, we completed the acquisition of
Orca, a Waltham, Massachusetts-based developer of high
performance Virtual InterfaceVI Architecture software
for enterprise-class UNIX and Windows systems. The acquisition
fits with our strategy of developing highly available and
reliable intelligent storage solutions that improve the
performance of todays Internet and enterprise applications
and strengthen our ability to develop next generation storage
networking architectures and protocols. The acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase. Under terms of the agreement, we
acquired Orca for $50,037 in common stock, assumed options and
cash, with an obligation to provide 264 shares of common stock,
which will result in additional stock compensation charges if
certain performance criteria are achieved. Orca met certain
performance criteria and as such, we issued and recorded during
fiscal 2003 and 2002 an additional 99 and 165 shares of common
stock. The fair market value of such shares of $921 and $3,015,
respectively, was measured on the date Orca met the performance
criteria and was recognized as stock compensation in fiscal 2003
and 2002. There are no additional performance milestones
remaining. We also paid certain transaction costs and assumed
certain operating assets and liabilities. The purchase price of the transaction was
allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their
estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition.
Approximately $26,688 was allocated to in-process research and
development and charged to operations because the acquired
technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative uses. The value was determined by estimating the
costs to develop the acquired in-process technology into
commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net 65 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued cash flows from such projects, and discounting
the net cash flows back to their present value. The discount
rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty
surrounding the successful development of the acquired
in-process technology. These estimates are subject to change,
given the uncertainties of the development process, and no
assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will
not occur. Costs incurred prior to establishment of
technological feasibility are charged to research and
development expense and have not been material through
April30, 2003. The Orca acquisition has been successfully
utilized for the design and development of the DAFS protocol. By
eliminating much of the traditional operating system overhead,
DAFS allows for improved I/ O performance while using fewer CPU
cycles. The protocol leverages next generation networking
technologies that provide remote memory transfer capabilities,
including RDMA implemented in VI and Infiniband. The DAFS
protocol has good industry support and is now under
consideration as an industry standard. We introduced DAFS
capable product in April 2002. In November 2000, we completed the acquisition of
WebManage, a Chelmsford, Massachusetts-based software developer
of content management, distribution, and analysis solutions.
WebManage develops software that intelligently distributes
content between various points on the Internet and enables
organizations to plan, manage and deliver Internet/intranet
services. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. Under
terms of the agreement, we acquired WebManage for $59,371 in
common stock, assumed options, and cash. We also had an
obligation to provide shares of common stock to be valued at
$3,000 if WebManage achieved certain performance criteria.
WebManage met these performance criteria in March 2001 and as
such, the contingent consideration was recorded as stock
compensation in the fourth quarter of 2001. We also paid certain
transaction costs and assumed certain operating assets and
liabilities. In fiscal 2003, we reached a final settlement of
the escrow fund arrangement under the WebManage acquisition
agreement. We have determined the total amount of our losses
under the settlement arrangement and 11 restricted shares were
released from the escrow and delivered to Network Appliance,
valued in the aggregate at $1,210 based on the fair market value
of our common stock as of the date of the acquisition.
Accordingly, an adjustment was made to the cost of the WebManage
acquisition. The balance of the escrow shares has been
distributed to former shareholders of WebManage in proportion to
their share ownership in WebManage, as provided in the original
merger agreement. 66 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

In accordance with FASB interpretation
No44, Accounting for Certain Transactions
involving Stock Compensation, we recorded the
intrinsic value, measured as the difference between the grant
price and fair market value on the acquisition consummation
date, of unvested options assumed in the WebManage acquisition
as deferred stock compensation. Such deferred stock
compensation, which aggregated to $12,304, is recorded as a
separate component of stockholders equity in the
accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet and will be
amortized over the vesting term of the related options. The operating results of Orca and WebManage have
been included in the condensed consolidated statements of

to certain adjustments, including amortization of purchased
intangibles, goodwill, contingently issuable shares, common
stock, and assumed options in connection with the acquisitions.
The $26,688 charge for purchased in-process research and
development has been excluded from the pro-forma results, as it
is a material nonrecurring charge. 12.Restructuring
Charges   
Fiscal 2002 Second Quarter Restructuring
Plan In August 2001, we implemented a restructuring
plan, which included a reduction in workforce by approximately
200 employees and a consolidation of facilities. The action was
required to properly align and manage the business commensurate
with our then current revenue levels. All functional areas of
the Company were affected by the reduction. We completed our
actions during the second quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result of
this restructuring, we incurred a charge of $7,980. The
restructuring charge included $4,796 of severance-related
amounts, $2,656 of committed excess facilities and facility
closure expenses, and $528 in fixed assets write-offs. The
reserve balance of $807 at April30, 2003 was included in
other accrued liabilities. During fiscal 2002, we purchased our Sunnyvale
headquarters site and terminated the operating leases. As a
result, an adjustment was made to reduce the previously recorded
estimated facilities lease losses by $1,509. During fiscal 2003,
we recorded a net restructuring adjustment of $334 due to
changes in the estimated costs of certain actions and final
resolution of certain restructuring activities. In the event
that the foreign facilities are not subleased, we will be
obligated for additional total lease payments of approximately
$659 to be payable through January 2006. 68 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Fiscal 2002 Fourth Quarter Restructuring
Plan In April 2002, we announced and substantially
completed a restructuring related to the closure of an
engineering facility and consolidation of resources to the
Sunnyvale headquarters, which included a headcount reduction of
34employees. As a result of this restructuring, we
incurred a charge of $5,850. The restructuring charge included
$813 of severance-related amounts, $4,564 of committed excess
facilities and facility closure expenses, and $473 in fixed
assets write-off. Of the reserve balance at April30, 2003 1,485 was included in other accrued liabilities and the
remaining $3,086 was classified as long-term obligations. In January 2003, we updated our assumptions and
estimates based on certain triggering events, which resulted in
an additional net charge of $923, primarily relating to our
engineering facility lease. Our estimates are reviewed and
revised periodically and may result in a substantial charge to
restructuring expense, should different conditions prevail than
were anticipated in original management estimates. Such
estimates included various assumptions such as the time period
over which the facilities will be vacant, expected sublease
terms, and expected sublease rates. In the event that the
engineering facility is not subleased, we will be obligated for
additional total lease payments of $3,385 to be payable through
November 2010. The following analysis sets forth the significant
components of the restructuring reserve at April30, 2003

STATEMENTSContinued Of the reserve balances at April30, 2003
and 2002, $1,485 and $1,061, respectively, were included in
other accrued liabilities and the remaining $3,086 and $3,655,
respectively, were classified as long-term obligations. 13.Goodwill and
Purchased Intangible Assets We adopted SFASNo142
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
effective May1, 2002. Upon adoption of
SFASNo142, we discontinued the amortization of our
recorded goodwill of $49,422 as of that date, identified our
reporting units based on our current segment reporting structure
and allocated all recorded goodwill, as well as other assets and
liabilities, to the reporting units. We concluded that our
reporting units are the same as our operating segments. Under
SFASNo142, goodwill attributable to each of our
reporting units is required to be tested for impairment by
comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its
carrying value. As of May1, 2002, this evaluation
indicated that the fair value for each of our reporting units
exceeded the reporting units carrying amount and no
impairment was recognized. On an ongoing basis, goodwill is
reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if
indicators of impairment arise. As of April30, 2003,
there had been no impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.
There can be no assurance that future impairment tests will not
result in a charge to earnings. In connection with the adoption of
SFASNo142, we also reassessed the useful lives and
the classification of our purchased intangible assets and
determined that they continued to be appropriate except for
acquired workforce net of deferred tax liabilities of $502,
which was reclassified into goodwill. A reconciliation of our previously reported net
income and net income per share to amounts for the exclusion of
goodwill amortization net of the related income tax effect

respectively and such amounts were included in cost of product
revenue. For fiscal 2004, estimated future amortization expense
is $2,954 and none thereafter. 70 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued 14.Guarantees As of April30, 2003, our financial
guarantees consisted of standby letters of credit outstanding,
bank guarantee, and restricted cash, which were related to
facility lease requirements, product performance guarantees,
customs and duties guarantees, VAT requirements, and
workers compensation plans. The maximum amount of
potential future payments under these arrangements was $2,630 as
of April30, 2003. Of this maximum exposure, $1,142 of
restricted cash was classified under Other Assets on our balance
sheet at April30, 2003. We have not recorded any liability
at April30, 2003 related to these guarantees. We provide both recourse and non-recourse lease
financing options to our customers. Under the terms of recourse
leases, which are generally 3years or less, we remain
liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments. We
defer 100% of the recourse lease obligation and recognize
revenue over the term of the lease as the lease payments become
due. As of April30, 2003 the maximum recourse exposure
totaled approximately $4,940. Under the terms of the
non-recourse leases, we do not have any continuing obligations
or liabilities. To date, we have not experienced significant
losses under this lease financing program. We do not maintain a general warranty reserve for
estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue is
recognized due to our extensive product quality program and
processes and because our customer service inventories utilized
to correct product failures are carried at zero cost. We defend and indemnify our customers for damages
and reasonable costs incurred in any suit or claim brought
against them alleging that our products sold to our customers
infringe any U.S.patent, copyright, trade secret or
similar right. If a product becomes the subject of an
infringement claim, we may, at our option: ireplace the
product with another non-infringing product that provides
substantially similar performance; iimodify the
infringing product so that it no longer infringes but remains
functionally equivalent; iiiobtain the right for the
customer to continue using the product at our expense and for
the reseller to continue selling the product; ivtake
back the infringing product and refund to customer the purchase
price paid less depreciation amortized on a straight line basis.
We have not been required to make material payments pursuant to
these provisions historically. We have not identified any losses
that are probable under these provisions and, accordingly, we
have not recorded a liability related to these indemnification
provisions. 15.Subsequent
Events On May13, 2003, we announced that the Board
of Directors has approved a $150,000 stock repurchase program to
purchase shares of our outstanding common stock. The duration of
the repurchase program is open-ended. Under the program, Network
Appliance, Inc. could purchase shares of common stock through
open market transactions at prices deemed appropriate by
management. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions
under this program will depend on market conditions and
corporate and regulatory considerations. The purchases will be
funded from available working capital. The stock repurchase
program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 16.Selected
