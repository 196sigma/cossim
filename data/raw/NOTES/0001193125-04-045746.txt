Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA  
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS  To the Board of

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Captaris, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Captaris, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.  As discussed in Note
1Goodwill, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective January 1, 2002.  As discussed in Note 1Stock-Based Compensation, the Company has restated its 2002 and 2001 pro forma net

CAPTARIS, INC.  NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Years ended December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001  1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Accounting Principles  The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  Principles of Consolidation  The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Captaris, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries the Company. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are used in accounting for the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, useful lives of intangible assets, equipment and leasehold improvements, inventory
valuation allowances, revenue recognition, and the estimated allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Reclassifications  As described in Note 4, on September 1, 2003, the Company sold its MediaLinq division. As such, in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, results of operations have been reclassified to reflect MediaLinqs operating results, net of income taxes, as Discontinued Operations. Further, certain prior-period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period
presentation.  Business Combinations  The Company includes the results of operations of acquired businesses from
the date of acquisition. Net assets of the companies acquired are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is included in goodwill in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. In certain circumstances, the Company has pushed down the goodwill to the acquiring foreign subsidiary resulting in foreign currency exchange differences upon consolidation.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Restricted Cash  Restricted cash consists of
cash collateralized for a letter of credit that serves as collateral pursuant to a lease agreement. 
39 Table of Contents CAPTARIS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Investments  The Company has classified its investments as available for sale and recorded them at market value. Investments with maturities of one year or
less are classified as short-term. Investment purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis and market value at period end is based on quoted market prices for each security. Realized gains and losses are determined on the specific
identification method. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of any tax effect, are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Interest income is recorded using an effective interest rate, with the associated premium or discount
amortized to interest income over the term of the investment. The Companys current investment policy only permits investing in government agency issues, certain adjustable rate mortgages that are government backed, and money market funds. With
the exception of the mortgages, the maximum maturity allowable is 36 months. Prior to July 2003, the Companys investment policy permitted investments in investment-grade corporate bonds. The Company currently has an investment of $562,000 in
one corporate bond that it acquired prior to July 2003. This bond matures in May 2004.  Concentration of Credit Risk  The Company
extends credit to customers and is therefore subject to credit risk. The Company performs initial and ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and does not require collateral. Estimates are used in determining the
allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on our historical bad debt experience, the aging of customer accounts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns.
Inventories  Inventories consist primarily of fax boards, which the company resells, as
well as computer assemblies, components and related equipment. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market as determined by the first-in, first out method. Due to rapid changes in technology, it is possible that older products in
inventories may become obsolete or the Company may sell these products below cost. When the Company determines that the carrying value of inventory is not recoverable, the Company writes down inventories to market value.  Equipment and Leasehold Improvements  Equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the
term of the lease.  Intangible and Long-lived Assets  Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their
estimated period of benefit, ranging from 1 to 12 years. All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets and takes into account events or circumstances that warrant
revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists.  In the second quarter of 2002, the Company engaged an independent valuation firm to provide an estimated fair value of each of its intangible, long-lived assets using a discounted cash flow model. The determination of
fair value is a critical and complex consideration when assessing impairment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, that involves
significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates were based on the Companys best judgments. As a result, the Company determined that certain intangible assets acquired from Infinite Technologies in January 2001 were
impaired. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $55 million for the mobile delivery product line in the second quarter of 2002. This impairment charge consisted of a write-down of core technology of approximately $24 million, a
write-down of customer base and marketing channel of approximately $22 million and a write-down of tradenames of approximately $849,000. No impairment charges were recognized in 2003 or 2001. 
40 Table of Contents CAPTARIS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Goodwill  Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired as of the acquisition date. The Company has adopted the
requirements of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangibles Assets. SFAS No. 142 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances. If impairment exists, goodwill is written
down to its fair value.  In January 2002, after completion of
an independent valuation primarily based on discounted cash flows, management determined that goodwill associated with the Companys mobile delivery product line was impaired. Accordingly, a non-cash charge of $27 million was recorded as a
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective January 1, 2002. There was no impairment of goodwill in 2003. See Note 8.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  For certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, recorded amounts
approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. Short-term and long-term investments are recorded at fair value as the underlying securities are classified as available for sale and marked to market at each reporting period.
The change in market value is recorded in other comprehensive income.  Foreign Currency  The financial statements of
our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries have been translated to U.S. dollars in accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates and
all revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period presented. Translation gains and losses are reported as other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of shareholders equity. In addition, the
Company has made a U.S. dollar denominated, long-term loan to one of its subsidiaries which it does not intend to require repayment for the foreseeable future. The translation gains and losses recognized by the foreign subsidiary related to this
loan are also recorded in other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated financial statements.  Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the
functional currency, including U.S. dollars. Gains and losses on those foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense for the period of exchange. Foreign currency transaction gains were $461,000 in 2003 and foreign currency
transaction losses were $58,000 in 2002. Foreign currency transaction gains in 2001 were not significant.  Segment Reporting  Historically, the Company classified its business into two major segments: software products and e-document services. In September 2003, the Company sold it e-document services operating segment see Note 4. As a result of the sale, the
Company now operates in only one operating segment.  Stock-Based
Compensation  During the second quarter of 2001, the
Company offered a limited non-compulsory exchange of employee stock options on a less than one-for-one basis. The exchange which closed on July 10, 2001 resulted in the voluntary cancellation of employee stock options to purchase 3,135,720 shares
of common stock with varying exercise prices greater than $1000 per share in exchange for 1,286,790 employee stock options with an exercise price of $211 per share. The option exchange offer resulted in variable accounting treatment for a total of
1,993,250 options, representing the 1,286,790 new options granted in the exchange, as well as all employee options modified during the year. Variable accounting will continue until all options subject to variable accounting treatment are exercised,
cancelled or expired. Variable accounting treatment will result in charges or credits, recorded to stock compensation expense benefit, dependent on unpredictable fluctuations in quoted prices for the Companys common stock. At December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company had 266,342, 1,370,779 and 1,783,132 options, respectively, to purchase common shares subject to variable accounting. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded an expense of $31
million, a benefit of $12 million, and an expense of $14 million, respectively, for variable stock compensation.

After filing our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, we discovered a computational error in the calculation of pro forma net loss and pro forma net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, which caused the amounts
of pro forma net loss and pro forma net loss per share to be understated in 2002 and 2001. Accordingly, we have restated this disclosure to reflect the proper amounts of pro forma net loss and pro forma net loss per share for 2002 and 2001.

Revenue Recognition 
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the guidelines of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA Statement of Position SOP No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP No. 98-9, Emerging Issues Task Force EITF No. 03-5,
Applicability of AICPA SOP No. 97-2 to Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return
Exists, and Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. These guidelines require that 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2 delivery
has occurred; 3 the selling price is fixed or determinable; and 4 collection is reasonably assured before revenue can be recognized. 
42 Table of Contents CAPTARIS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
The Company sells products through resellers, original equipment manufacturers OEMs,
and other channel partners, as well as directly to end users and recognizes product revenue upon shipment, net of estimated returns, provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain. All software licenses
are bundled with 30 days of telephone support. Revenue associated with this telephone support is not significant. Therefore revenue related to this telephone support is not deferred. The cost of providing this telephone support is accrued at the
time the related revenue is recognized. Whenever a software license, hardware, installation and post-contract customer support or PCS elements are combined into a package with a single bundled price, a portion of the sales price is
allocated to each element of the bundled elements based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately. Revenue from the license of software is recognized when the software has been shipped and the
customer is obligated to pay for the software. Revenue for PCS is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service contract term, generally one to five years. PCS includes rights to unspecified upgrades and updates, when and if available, and
bug fixes. Installation revenue is recognized when the product has been installed at the customers site and accepted by the customer. Recognition of revenue from software sold with installation services is recognized either when the software
is shipped or when the installation services are completed, depending on the Companys agreement with the customer and whether the installation services are integral to the functionality of the software. Consulting services are customarily
billed at fixed rates, plus out-of-pocket expenses, and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed. However, if it is determined that a consulting engagement will be unprofitable, a loss is recognized at that time. Training
revenue is recognized when the training is completed. Costs related to insignificant customer support obligations, which include telephone support, are accrued at the time the related revenue is recognized. Prior to our sale of the MediaLinq
division, the Company recognized revenue from document delivery services when services were provided. Revenue related to the OEM agreement with Cisco Systems, Inc. Cisco was recognized when cash payments were received and all services
had been performed.  In general, customers are granted a 30-day
right of return for product sales. The Company accrues estimated future product returns primarily based on historical experience. The allowance for sales returns was $536,000 and $1,178,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively and is netted
against accounts receivable. When rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns, we recognize revenue when customer acceptance occurs.  Research and Development Costs  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The Company has not capitalized any software development costs, as technological feasibility is
not generally established until substantially all development is complete.  Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income
taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. These deferred taxes are measured
using tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. The Company will establish a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than not that it will generate sufficient taxable income to allow for the realization of our
deferred net tax asset.  Income Loss Per Share  Basic net income loss per common share is computed by dividing net income
loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted income loss per common share is computed by dividing net income by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding

New Accounting Pronouncements  In July 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a
consensus on EITF No. 03-5, Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position SOP No. 97-2 to Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software. This EITF addresses the application of the provisions
of SOP No. 97-2 to arrangements containing software and non-software deliverables where the software is more than incidental to the products and services as a whole. The adoption of EITF No. 03-5 did not have a material impact on the Companys
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments With Characteristics of Both Liabilities
and Equity. SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how the Company would classify and measure financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and requires the Company to classify a financial instrument that is within
the scope of SFAS No. 150 as a liability or an asset in some circumstances. SFAS No. 150 also revises the definition of a liability to encompass obligations that the Company can or must settle by issuing equity shares, depending on the nature of
the relationship established between the Company and a holder of its stock. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material impact on the
Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and hedging
activities under SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149 is effective for certain contracts entered into or modified by the Company after June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results
of operations or cash flows. 
44 Table of Contents CAPTARIS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation FIN No. 46, Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, and in December 2003, issued a revision to that interpretation, FIN No. 46R. FIN No. 46R replaces FIN No. 46 and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain
characteristics. A variable interest entity VIE is defined as a an ownership, contractual or monetary interest in an entity where the ability to influence financial decisions is not proportional to the investment interest, or b an
entity lacking the invested capital sufficient to fund future activities without the support of a third party. FIN No. 46R establishes standards for determining under what circumstances VIEs should be consolidated with their primary beneficiary,
including those to which the usual condition for consolidation does not apply. Certain of the disclosure requirements prescribed by FIN No. 46R apply in all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest
entity was established. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.  In November 2002, the EITF published its consensus on EITF No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF No. 00-21 provides
guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF No. 00-21 apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning
after June 15, 2003. The Company adopted EITF No. 00-21 on July 1, 2003. The adoption of EITF No. 00-21 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN No. 45, Guarantors Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN No. 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under
guarantees issued. FIN No. 45 also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken. In addition, FIN No. 45 also requires a guarantor to make significant
new disclosures, even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote. In general, FIN No. 45 applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed
party based on changes in an underlying obligation that is related to an asset, liability or an equity security of the guaranteed party. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN No. 45 are applicable to guarantees issued or modified
after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements were effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The adoption of FIN No. 45 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  3. Businesses
Acquired  On October 20, 2003, the Company acquired
certain distribution rights from Axient Pty Limited Axient, a distributor of computer-based fax and e-document delivery solutions for the Australian and New Zealand markets. The Company paid $235,000 in cash and recorded goodwill of
$235,000.  On September 30, 2003, Captaris and its indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary, 3082012 Nova Scotia Company, a Nova Scotia, Canada unlimited liability company, acquired Teamplate, Inc. Teamplate, an Alberta, Canada corporation. Teamplates product is a business process automation
product built on the Microsoft.NET framework for Web services. This acquisition enhances the Captaris business strategy in business information delivery solutions for enterprise customers worldwide, and provides resources to further penetrate the
business process automation market. Teamplates technology extends the Captaris business information delivery solutions with streamlined enterprise application integration, rapid solution deployment, sophisticated business rules processing and
integrated process monitoring and metrics. The Company believes that combining the technologies of both companies will allow customers to achieve new levels of collaboration, accountability and business agility while reducing overall operational
costs. Since the transaction occurred on September 30, 2003, the Companys results of operations include Teamplates results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2003.  Under the terms of the agreement, Captaris acquired all of the stock of
Teamplate for $81 million in cash, issued 574,727 shares of Captaris common stock valued at approximately $30 million that were issued on October 3, 2003 Note 11, and assumed liabilities of approximately $837,000, all resulting in an aggregate
purchase price of $124 million, including transaction costs of approximately $325,000. The value of the common stock issued was determined using the closing price of Captaris stock on the Nasdaq National Market on September 30, 2003; the date
the acquisition was announced and consummated. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Company deposited $500,000 in escrow as security for a post closing adjustment, as 
45 Table of Contents CAPTARIS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
defined, to be determined on December 31, 2003. The Company recorded this deposit in prepaid expenses and other.
Subsequent to December 31, 2003, the Company and the former Teamplate shareholders agreed that the post closing purchase price adjustment, as defined, would not be paid. As a result, the Company expects the deposit, in escrow, to be returned to it
in 2004. In addition, pursuant to the agreement, the purchase price is subject to a separate post closing adjustment equal to certain accounts receivable, if the amount is not collected by September 30, 2004.  The common stock issued in connection with this acquisition will be held in a
third-party escrow account for one year as security for certain post closing obligations of the Teamplate shareholders, including indemnification provisions whereby the Teamplate shareholders agreed to indemnify the Company against claims resulting
from various representations and warranties made by the former Teamplate shareholders. In addition, the Company agreed to indemnify the Teamplate shareholders against claims resulting from various representations and warranties made by the Company.
At December 31, 2003, the former Teamplate shareholders have made no indemnification claims.  As part of an incentive program to the management team of Teamplate, if the business plan for the combination achieves certain performance targets, the management team may earn a minimum of $28 million up to a
maximum of $83 million over the thirteen quarter period following the closing. The Companys obligation to pay this incentive compensation is also based on continued employment. Any incentive compensation earned under this program will be
recorded as compensation expense in the period earned. For the three months ended December 31, 2003, compensation expense related to this incentive program was $300,000.  In accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, all identifiable assets and liabilities were assigned a
portion of the cost of the acquisition based on their respective fair values. The Company engaged an independent valuation firm to provide an estimated fair value for all identifiable intangibles including workflow server technology, tradename,
customer relationships and reseller agreements, using a discounted cash flow model. The determination of fair value is a critical and complex consideration that involves significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates were
based on the Companys best judgments and resulted in the allocation of purchase price for this acquisition as detailed below. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired was allocated to goodwill.  Teamplate Purchase Price Allocation inthousands

Equipment 102
Current assets 1,478 Total purchase price 12,410  The purchase price
allocation set forth above is subject to additional adjustments related to the payment of a certain liability and the ultimate collection of certain accounts receivable. All such adjustments identified during the allocation period, expected to
expire on September 30, 2004, would change the carrying amount of the goodwill generated as a result of the acquisition. On December 31, 2003, the Company increased the carrying value of goodwill related to this acquisition by $151,000 primarily for
additional legal fees incurred in connection with the acquisition and for an additional payment made for the repayment of a note payable assumed in the acquisition at September 30, 2003.  All identified amortizable intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives,
ranging from fifteen months to seven years. The weighted-average useful life of these assets is approximately 69 years. The Company expects to recognize amortization expense for these intangible assets of approximately $755,000 for the year ending
December 31, 2004 and $683,000 during each of the years ending December 31, 2005 through September 30, 2010. All of the $60 million allocated to goodwill was assigned to the fax and messaging reporting unit and is expected to be deductible for tax
purposes.

In August 2002, the
Company acquired the distribution activities, assets and fifteen employees of its longtime distributor in the Netherlands, OfficeCom B.V. OfficeCom. The Company paid $416,000 in cash, assumed net liabilities of $146,000 and recorded
goodwill of $562,000 in the fax and messaging reporting unit. Pro forma information as if the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2001, is not material.  On January 3, 2001, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Infinite Technologies Infinite, a privately held global supplier of
wireless applications and wireless infrastructure solutions for a total consideration of up to $241 million. At closing, the Company paid approximately $91 million in cash and issued 1,631,600 shares of the Companys common stock valued at
$81 million. At the time of closing, the Company was obligated to pay approximately $29 million in a combination of cash and the Companys common stock over the next three years; this obligation was recorded at the time of closing as a note
payable of $14 million net of imputed interest, and stock to be issued totaling $15 million. Additionally, the Company could have paid up to an additional $39 million to the founder of Infinite who became an employee of the Company, in a
combination of cash and the Companys common stock under an earn-out arrangement over a period of three years from the date of closing which the Company would have expensed as compensation expense. The Company accounted for the business
combination as a purchase. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded a one-time charge in the first quarter of 2001 related to purchased in-process research and development in the amount of $19 million.  In April 2002, the employee resigned and signed a separation agreement under
which the Company paid approximately $15 million in cash in full satisfaction of all outstanding payments due under the agreement. The remainder of the accrued amounts of the purchase price, $14 million, was recorded as a reduction of goodwill.
The Company also reversed a 2001 accrual for the employees performance incentive of approximately $700,000, which is reported as a reduction of 2002 research and development expenses.

Discontinued Operations  On September 15, 2003, Captaris and its wholly-owned subsidiary, MediaTel Corporation Delaware MediaTel, entered into an asset purchase agreement, effective as of September 1, 2003, to sell the assets of MediaLinq, an
outsourced division of Captaris operated by MediaTel, to PTEK Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Xpedite Systems, Inc. Xpedite. MediaLinq provides outsourced e-document delivery services. Under the terms of the agreement,
Xpedite paid Captaris $149 million in cash and assumed certain liabilities. The purchase price is subject to a post-closing net working capital adjustment, which will be determined in 2004. At December 31, 2003, Xpedite has made an indemnification
claim to the Company related to amounts billed by Qwest Communications. The Company believes the claim is unfounded. The ultimate outcome of this claim cannot presently be determined. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution could have a material
adverse effect on the Companys financial position, cash flow and results of operations. In addition, the Company is contingently obligated to indemnify Xpedite against claims resulting from various representations and warranties made by the
Company. Concurrent with the sale transaction, the Company and Xpedite also entered into license and reseller agreements under which the Company will license its fax-to-mail technology to Xpedite in return for minimum compensation of $20 million
over a three year period, and the parties will cooperate in providing mutual resale opportunities for each others products and services. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of MediaLinq of approximately $58 million, net of income taxes
of $38 million, in the year ended December 31, 2003.

On September 29, 2003, Captaris announced the sale of its
CallXpress product line, which primarily includes the Captaris voice and unified messaging assets, to Sound Advantage, LLC Sound Advantage, a California limited liability company.  Under the terms of the agreement, Sound Advantage acquired the CallXpress
product line for $25 million in cash and will pay up to an additional $10 million per year over a three year period beginning January 1, 2004 pursuant to an earn out arrangement, which is based on achievement of specified revenue targets for the
CallXpress business. In addition, Captaris was issued a 10 percent equity interest in Applied Voice and Speech Technologies, Inc. AVST, a newly formed company established by Sound Advantage to acquire and operate the combined
CallXpress and Sound Advantage businesses. RightFax will continue to be a part of AVSTs Unified Messaging offering, based on an ongoing OEM agreement. Also, the Company agreed to indemnify AVST against claims resulting from various
representations and warranties made by the Company. At December 31, 2003 no indemnification claims have been made by AVST. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of CallXpress of approximately $22 million in 2003.  Components of the CallXpress product line reflected in the Companys

Goodwill  Upon adopting SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangibles Assets,
management determined that the Company had three reporting units: E-document services and two reportable units within the products segment mobile delivery and the combination of fax and messaging products. After completion of an independent
valuation primarily based on discounted cash flows, management determined that goodwill associated with the mobile delivery reporting unit was impaired. Accordingly, a non-cash charge of $27 million was recorded as a cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle effective January 1, 2002. In 2002, the Company closed its separate operations acquired in the Infinite acquisition. The operations of Infinite were consolidated with the fax and messaging reporting unit and the goodwill
remaining was transferred accordingly.

Intangible and Other Assets
On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 prescribes accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. In the second quarter of 2002, the Company engaged an independent valuation firm to
provide an estimated fair value of each of its intangible, long-lived assets using a discounted cash flow model. The determination of fair value is a critical and complex consideration when assessing impairment under SFAS No. 144 that involves
significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates were based on the Companys best judgments. As a result, the Company determined that certain intangible assets acquired from Infinite Technologies in January 2001 were
impaired. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $55 million for the mobile delivery reporting unit in the second quarter of 2002. This impairment charge consisted of a write-down of core technology of approximately $24 million,
a write-down of customer base and marketing channel of approximately $22 million and a write-down of tradenames of approximately $849,000.

being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life ranging from 15 months to twelve years. Amortization expense for certain technology and license agreements is recorded in cost of revenue and was $377,000, $260,000 and
$210,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Amortization expense for intangible assets excluding certain technology and license agreements is recorded in operating expenses and was $275,000, $942,000 and $4,951,000 for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Based on the current amount of intangible assets subject to amortization, the estimated amortization expense for 2004 through 2008 is as follows: $12 million for 2004, $11 million in each of
the years 2005 through 2007, and $773,000 for 2008.  In April
2002, the Company entered into a nonexclusive license agreement with AudioFax IP LLC, settling a patent infringement suit filed by AudioFax on November 30, 2001. The Company paid a one-time fee to license the technology until the patents expire in
2008 and 2011. In the first quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a charge of $875,000, reflecting managements assessment of the fair value of the portion of the license fee that relates to prior years. The remaining balance of the license fee
was capitalized and is being amortized over the remaining life of the licensors patents. Included in total amortization expense discussed above, amortization expense related to this license was $90,000 and $67,000 for the years ended December
31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and is recorded in cost of revenue.  In July 1996, the Company agreed to purchase a license to sell products using certain additional patented technology. The Company recorded an intangible asset as a result of this agreement in the amount of $446,000. This intangible asset
was amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining average lives of the related patents and was fully amortized as of September 30, 2002. This intangible was written off in September 2003, in connection with the sale of CallXpress. See Note
5. Included in the total amortization expense discussed above, amortization expense recorded in cost of revenue for this license was $49,000 in 2002 and $66,000 in 2001.  In September 1995, the Company agreed to purchase a license to sell products using certain patented technology. The Company
recorded an intangible asset as a result of this agreement in the amount of $17 million. This intangible asset is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining average lives of the related patents approximately 12 years. Included in
the total amortization expense discussed above, amortization expense recorded in cost of revenue for this license was $144,000 in each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.  10.

covenants and restrictions as to various matters, including restrictions on the Companys ability to pay cash
dividends without the banks prior approval. The Company is currently in compliance with such financial covenants and restrictions. Borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the banks prime rate or, at the Companys
option, the one, two, three or six month LIBOR rate plus 15%.  11.
Redeemable Common Stock  On October 3, 2003, in connection
with the acquisition of Teamplate on September 30, 2003 Note 3, the Company issued 574,727 shares of common stock valued at approximately $30 million. On the first anniversary of the closing, each Teamplate shareholder will have the option to
require Captaris to purchase all of the shareholders portion of the Captaris common stock issued in the transaction at a price per share of $522 if a the average of the last sale prices of the common stock for the 20 trading days prior to
September 30, 2004 is less than $522 per share; and b the last sale price of the common stock on September 30, 2004 is less than $522 per share. As a result of this buyback clause, the Company has recorded the issuance of this common stock as
Redeemable Common Stock on the balance sheet.  12. Shareholders Equity
Stock Option Plans  The Company has stock option plans under which employees, directors,
officers and other agents may be granted options to purchase common stock. The Company has reserved approximately 13,900,000 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to these plans upon exercise of outstanding options and upon exercise of
options to be granted in the future. Options generally vest over three to four years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. The options are exercisable at prices generally equal to fair market value or at the discretion of the Board of
Directors.  At December 31, 2003, the Company has reserved the
following number of common stock shares for future grant under the Companys stock option plans:  1989 Plan

Pursuant to a stock repurchase plan approved by the
Companys Board of Directors, the Company repurchased $31 million, $34 million and $12 million of its common stock in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, pursuant to this and previously approved plans. As of December 31, 2003, approximately
$120 million remains available to repurchase shares. The Company may repurchase shares in the future subject to open trading windows, overall market conditions, stock prices, and the Companys cash position and requirements going forward. See
Note 23.  13. Loans to Non-Officer Employees  Non-officer employee loans were made under a program to allow non-officer
employees to purchase the Companys common stock in the open market in 2000. The unsecured loans bear interest at the lowest rate allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. No loans issued under this program were outstanding at December 31, 2003.
Loans from non-officer employees were $218,000 as of December 31, 2002. During 2003 and 2002, the Company wrote down the value of these loans approximately $7,000 and $476,000, respectively, to reflect their expected net realizable value. In 2003,
the Company canceled 13,368 shares of common stock in connection with these loans.  14. OEM Agreement  In January 2002, the
Company entered into an original equipment manufacturing OEM agreement with Cisco Systems, Inc. Cisco, under which the Company granted Cisco an exclusive third-party license to certain enabling technology. The agreement
generally provided for quarterly payments to be made by Cisco to the Company through mid-2005. However, the timing and amount of these payments were subject to a number of conditions, some of which were beyond the control of the Company, including
Ciscos ability to successfully implement the technology. The Company received a payment of $833,000 in 2001 and received payments of $25 million in 2002. The Company recognized $33 million in revenue from this agreement in 2002. The Company
did not recognize revenue from Cisco in 2001.  On October 30,
2003, the Company reached an agreement with Cisco Systems to accelerate the conclusion of its OEM contract. Pursuant to the agreement, Cisco agreed to pay the Company $120 million as payment in full of all remaining unpaid aggregate license fees.
In return, the Company agreed to provide a maximum of 320 hours of support and training services for a period not to exceed twelve months. As a result of this agreement, the Company recognized revenue of $119 million during the quarter ending
December 31, 2003. The Company deferred revenue of $100,000 related to support and training services that will be recognized as revenue as support and training services are provided by the Company over the next nine months.

15. Commitments and Contingencies  Leases  The Company leases its office space and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire between March 2004 and February 2008. Rent
expense under the non-cancelable leases amounted to $23 million, $31 million and $30 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:  inthousands

2005 1,206
2006 1,086
2007 852
2008 127 4,614  Guarantees  The Company guarantees certain operating leases of its wholly owned
subsidiaries, which commitments are reflected above.  Intellectual Property
The Company periodically receives letters and other
communications from third parties asserting patent rights and requesting royalty payments, and will probably receive additional claims in the future. For example, over the past six years, the Company has been involved in intermittent communications
with Avaya, which was spun off from Lucent Technologies in 2001. Over this period of time, Lucent/Avaya asserted that the Company was infringing on their patents or technology, eventually identifying 10 patents as including claims that allegedly
cover the Companys current or former products and/or services. Several communications and meetings between the Company and Lucent/Avaya have occurred. The Company has also been in communication with BellSouth since December of 2001, at which
time BellSouth asserted that the Company was infringing on two of its patents. Analysis of both patents in light of the Companys current and former products/services is still underway. The last communication with representatives of BellSouth
was on June 19, 2003. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, cash flow and results of
operations.  Indemnifications  In the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its products, the
Company indemnifies other parties, including customers, resellers, distributors, OEMs, and parties to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. The Company has agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses
arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made by certain parties. The Company evaluates estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for
Contingencies, as interpreted by FIN No. 45. The Company considers such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the loss. To date, the Company has not
encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.

16. Restructuring Charges, Severance and Voluntary Layoff Program  Severance expense unrelated to a restructuring charge and severance expenses
for voluntary layoff programs were recorded in cost of revenue, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses as follows:  In September 2003, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $624,000 in selling, general and administrative expenses for severance expense. These costs were paid as of
December 31, 2003.  In October 2002, the Company announced to its employees a voluntary layoff program, which subsequently resulted in a reduction of approximately 40 employees or 9% of its workforce,
at a cost of $670,000. Approximately $561,000 of the total charge was paid in 2003 and the remainder was paid in 2002. Allocation of the costs of this program to operating expenses is as follows:  Year Ended December31,2002 inthousands

Selling, general and administrative 359 Total charge 670  Restructuring charges
were recorded separately on the statement of operations as follows:  In September 2003, in conjunction with the sale of its CallXpress product line, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $423,000 for severance and related
benefits for terminated employees associated with CallXpress. All of these expenses were paid as of December 31, 2003.  In January 2002, the Company announced a reduction of our workforce, affecting approximately 90 employees, or 18% of the total Company workforce. This reduction in force resulted in
the recognition of a restructuring charge recorded in continuing operations of $20 million related to severance, impairment of certain assets and non-cancelable lease obligations; and a restructuring charge recorded in discontinued operations of
$100,000 related to severance. All costs associated with this reduction in force were paid as of December 31, 2002.  On March 15, 2001, the Company announced the consolidation of its two primary product groups, the Computer Telephony Software Group and the Document Exchange Software Group,
resulting in a 14% reduction of its workforce and a one-time charge of $10 million which consisted primarily of severance and other employee benefits and consulting services, and was fully paid by the end of 2001.  17.

19. Legal Proceedings  One of the services provided by MediaTel Corporation MediaTel, a wholly owned subsidiary of Captaris, was the
transmission of facsimile advertisements to travel industry participants on behalf of travel service providers. MediaTel held a license to use a database supplied by Northstar Travel Media that lists recipients for these facsimile advertisements.
All of the assets of MediaTel were sold to a subsidiary of PTEK Holdings, Inc. PTEK on September 1, 2003. On or about July 29, 2003, Travel 100 Group, Inc. Travel 100 filed two lawsuits in Circuit Court in Cook County,
Illinois, one against Mediterranean Shipping Company Mediterranean and another against The Melrose Hotel Company Melrose. The complaints are substantially identical in form and allege violations of the Telephone Consumer
Protection Act in connection with the receipt of facsimile advertisements that were transmitted by MediaTel. Each complaint seeks injunctive relief and unspecified damages, and certification as a class action on behalf of Travel 100 and others
similarly situated that received the facsimile advertisements.  MediaTel contracted with a third party to provide facsimile advertising services for Mediterranean. The third party, in turn, contracted with Mediterranean. Melrose contracted directly with MediaTel for transmission of the facsimile
advertisements. In its answer filed on September 23, 2003, Mediterranean named Captaris as a third-party defendant and asserted that to the extent that Mediterranean is liable, Captaris should be liable under theories of indemnification or
contribution for any damages suffered by Mediterranean. Similarly, in its answer filed on October 14, 2003, Melrose named Captaris, as well as PTEK, as third-party defendants based on allegations of breach of contract and claims for contribution. In
response to Mediterraneans third-party complaint, Captaris filed its answer on November 3, 2003, denying the allegations filed by Mediterranean and further answering by way of affirmative defenses that to the extent Captaris is found liable
for any damages allegedly suffered by plaintiffs or any third-party plaintiffs in this action, Captaris is entitled to indemnification and/or contribution from other non-parties to this action. Captaris filed a similar answer to Melroses
complaint on November 20, 2003. The outcome of these matters, including the plaintiffs success in achieving class certification, is uncertain.  The ultimate outcome of these matters, discussed above, cannot presently be determined. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a
material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, cash flow and results of operations.  On September 25, 2002, Lan-Aces, Inc. filed a complaint in the District Court of Harris County, Texas against the Company seeking damages of $600,000 plus
attorneys fees for breach of contract. The Company removed the action to Federal Court in the Southern District of Texas on October 18, 2002. On January 23, 2003, Lan-Aces, Inc. filed an amended complaint adding unspecified statutory damages
under the Copyright Act. The amended complaint alleged that the Company either breached an alleged agreement between the plaintiff and Infinite Technologies, Inc., or infringed plaintiffs copyright, with respect to software incorporated in the
MailandNews.com website, a free Internet service acquired as part of the Infinite Technologies acquisition and subsequently transferred to an unrelated third party. In July 2003, the matter was resolved by settlement between the parties,
pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay an immaterial amount to the plaintiff. Pursuant to settlement, the case has been dismissed.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  In connection with the completion of its audit for the two years ended December 31, 2002, our independent auditors, Deloitte and Touche LLP DT, formally advised our management and the Audit Committee of our Board of
Directors of certain deficiencies that exist in the design or operation of our internal accounting controls. These deficiencies were discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and resulted in the restatement of the financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2001. Our independent accountants issued a material weakness letter under standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA.  In the current year, these deficiencies contributed to a computational error
in the calculation of compensation expense for options subject to variable accounting, resulting in a restatement of our 2003 quarterly financial results. Our independent auditors advised our management and the Audit Committee of our Board of
Directors of certain deficiencies in the internal control structure for the year ended December 31, 2003, which, although not as significant as a material weakness, constitute a reportable condition in our internal control structure under standards
established by the AICPA.  Under the supervision and with the
participation of the Companys management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer the CEO and Chief Financial Officer the CFO, the Company has evaluated the internal control deficiencies and the
effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-153 as of the end of the period covered by this report the Evaluation. During the course of the Evaluation, the CEO and CFO
took note of, and considered as part of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures, the additional procedures performed and controls instituted by the Company to supplement its internal controls in order to mitigate the effect of the
deficiencies and to prevent misstatements or omissions in its consolidated financial statements. Based on the Evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded, that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures, including the additional procedures,
were effective as of the end of the quarter to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the appropriate time periods.  The Company has made, and will continue to make, improvements to its
