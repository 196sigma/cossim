8X8, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 -- THE COMPANY AND ITS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES THE COMPANY
8x8, Inc. the Company or 8x8 was incorporated in California in
February 1987. In December 1996, the Company was reincorporated in Delaware.
The Company develops, manufactures and markets telecommunication equipment
focused on multimedia Internet protocol IP applications. The Company
products are highly integrated, leverage its proprietary technology and are
comprised of multimedia communication semiconductors, multimedia compression
algorithms, network protocols and embedded system design. These products are
used in applications including voice-over-IP, video monitoring and streaming,
and videoconferencing. The Company markets its products mainly to original
equipment manufacturers OEMs, but also to end users for its Video Monitoring
system products.
In an effort to expand the available market for its multimedia
communication products, the Company began developing low-cost consumer
videophones and marketing these products to consumers under the ViaTV brand name
in 1997. However in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company determined
that due to a combination of factors including the high cost of maintaining a
consumer distribution channel, the slower than expected growth rate of the
consumer videophone market, and the low gross margins typical of a consumer
electronics product made it unlikely that the consumer videophone business would
be profitable in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the Company announced in
April 1999 that it would cease production of the ViaTV product line and withdraw
from its distribution channels over the subsequent several quarters. The Company
does not expect to be able to generate revenues from its other products to
compensate for the loss of ViaTV revenues for at least the next twelve months,
if at all. If the Company can not adequately compensate for lower revenues with
decreased manufacturing overhead expenses and with lower operating expenses, it
could have a material adverse effect on the Company business and operating
results. See also Note 9.
FISCAL YEAR
The Company fiscal year ends on the last Thursday on or before March 31.
For purposes of these consolidated financial statements, the Company has
indicated its fiscal year as ending on March 31.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenues from product sales to OEMs and other end users are recognized upon
shipment. License revenues are generally recognized upon the delivery of the
licensed technology provided no significant future obligations exist and
collection is probable. For financial reporting purposes, revenues generated by
sales to distributors and retailers under agreements allowing certain rights of
return are deferred until the product is
40
43
8X8, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
sold by the distributor or retailer. When no rights of return exist, revenues
generated by product sales are recognized upon shipment.
CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Management determines
the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of
purchase and reevaluates the classification at each reporting date. At March 31,
1999 and 1998, the Company classified its investments either as
available-for-sale or as trading. The cost of the Company investments is
determined based upon specific identification. Investments classified as
available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses,
net of related tax, if any, recorded as a separate component of stockholders'
equity. At March 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company investments classified as
available-for-sale totaled $141 million and $260 million, respectively, and
were primarily comprised of money market funds with an effective maturity of
three months or less. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale investments were
$193,000 and $45,000 at March 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The investments
classified as trading are reported at fair value with realized and unrealized
gains and losses being reported in the statement of operations. The Company did
not have any investments classified as trading at March 31, 1999 and the cost
and fair value of investments classified as trading at March 31, 1998 were not
significant. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on the Company
investments classified as trading were also not significant for the years ended
March 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997.
INVENTORY
Inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates
actual cost, using the first-in, first-out method or market.
NONMARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS
Nonmarketable equity investments, included in other assets, of less than
20% of the investee outstanding voting stock are accounted for using the cost
method, because the Company does not have an ability to significantly influence
the operating and financial policies of the investees. Loss resulting from
impairment in the value of investments which is other than a temporary decline
is recorded in the period in which such loss occurs.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line
method, based upon the shorter of the estimated useful lives, ranging from three
to five years, or the lease term of the respective assets as follows                     
Machinery and computer equipment. 3 years
Furniture and fixtures. 5 years
Licensed  3 years
Leasehold  Shorter of lease term or useful life of the asset WARRANTY EXPENSE
The Company provides for the estimated cost which may be incurred under its
product warranties upon revenue recognition.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
RESEARCH AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred.
Software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological
feasibility are included in research and development and are expensed as
incurred. The Company defines establishment of technological feasibility as the
completion of a working model. Software development costs incurred subsequent to
the establishment of technological feasibility through the period of general
market availability of the product are capitalized, if material. To date, all
software development costs have been expensed as incurred.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of the Company foreign
subsidiary. Exchange gains and losses resulting from transactions denominated in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in the results of operations
for the year. To date, such amounts have not been significant. Total assets of
the Company foreign subsidiary were $656,000, $620,000 and $429,000, as of
March 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The Company does not undertake any
foreign currency hedging activities.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach.
Under the asset and liability approach, a current tax liability or asset is
recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the
current year. A deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated
future tax effects attributed to temporary differences and carryforwards. If
necessary, the deferred tax assets are reduced by the amount of benefits that,
based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments and trade accounts receivable. The Company places its
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments primarily in market rate
accounts with reputable financial institutions. Cash equivalents present risk of
changes in value because of interest rate changes. The Company has not
experienced any material losses relating to any investment instruments. The
Company sells its products to OEMs and distributors throughout the world. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial
condition and maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based
upon the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. At March 31, 1999,
two customers accounted for 20% and 10% of accounts receivable, respectively. At
March 31, 1998, one customer accounted for 30% of accounts receivable.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amount of the Company financial instruments, including cash
equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and nonmarketable
equity investments, approximate fair values.
ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
In fiscal 1999, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. Comprehensive income, as
defined, includes all changes in equity net assets during a period from
non-owner sources. The primary difference between net income and comprehensive
income, for the Company, is due to unrealized losses on short-term investments
classified as available-for-sale. Comprehensive income is being shown in the
consolidated statements of stockholders' equity.
SEGMENT INFORMATION
In fiscal 1999, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 131 FAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information. This statement establishes standards for the way companies
report information about operating segments in annual financial statements. It
also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services,
geographical areas and major customers. In accordance with the provisions of FAS
131, the Company determined that it has one reportable operating segment.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform with the
fiscal 1999 presentation.
NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE
Basic net income loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss
available to common stockholders numerator by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period denominator. Diluted net income
loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares
and potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common
shares result from the assumed exercise, using the treasury stock method, of
outstanding convertible noncumulative preferred stock Preferred Stock, common
stock options and unvested restricted common stock having a dilutive effect.
The numerators for each period presented are equal to the reported net
income loss. The reconciliation of the denominators used in computing basic
and diluted per share amounts is as follows in thousands                                YEAR ENDED MARCH 31,

for issuance to participating employees who meet certain eligibility
requirements. At the start of each fiscal year, the number of shares of common
stock subject to the Purchase Plan increases so that 500,000 shares remain
available for issuance. This provision resulted in an increase of 70,560 shares
issuable under the Purchase Plan during the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999.
During fiscal 1999 and 1998, 187,491 and 70,560 shares were issued under the

the common stock at the beginning of each two year offering period or the end of
a six month purchase period, whichever is lower. The contribution amount may not
exceed ten percent of an employee base compensation, including commissions but
not including bonuses and overtime, In the event of a merger of the Company with

quarterly income before income taxes. In July 1997, the Board of Directors
amended the profit sharing plan such that future profit sharing amounts are
calculated as a percentage of net income. Charges related to this plan were
approximately $685,000 in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998, and were not
significant for the fiscal years ended March 31, 1999 or 1997.

approximately 13% of total revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1997.
NOTE 9 -- RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND INVENTORY CHARGES   In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company determined that due to a
combination of factors including the high cost of maintaining a consumer
distribution channel, the slower than expected growth rate of the consumer
videophone market, and the low gross margins typical of a consumer electronics
product made it unlikely that the consumer videophone business would be
profitable in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the Company announced in April
1999 that it would cease production of the ViaTV product line and withdraw from
its distribution channels over the subsequent several quarters. In conjunction
with this decision the Company recorded a $57 million charge associated with
the write off of ViaTV videophone inventories.
During fiscal 1997, the Company recorded a charge for restructuring its
operations by reducing its workforce by approximately 25%. Additionally, the
Company recorded a charge of $40 million related to its MPEG semiconductor
inventories. In September 1996, the Company sold its remaining MPEG inventory.
As of March 31, 1997, the Company restructuring actions were fully completed.
NOTE 10 -- SUBSEQUENT EVENT   On May 13, 1999, the Company and Odesei S.A. Odesei announced an
agreement for the Company to acquire Odesei in a transaction where Odesei
shareholders will receive approximately 3603 shares of the Company common
stock for each share of Odesei common stock subject to certain adjustments. The
total number of shares of the Company to be exchanged is approximately 29
million shares. The transaction is expected to be accounted for using the
purchase method. The acquisition is subject to certain closing conditions. The
Company anticipates completing the acquisition during its first fiscal quarter
ending June 30, 1999.
