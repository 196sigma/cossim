Firm
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Ezenia! Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Ezenia! Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2005 and 2004
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity,
and cash flows for the three year period ended December31, 2005. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at
a. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the auditing
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to
perform, an audit of its internal controls over financial reporting. Our audits
included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis
for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Ezenia! Inc. and subsidiaries at December31, 2005
and 2004 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
See Note 6 for a
discussion regarding restatement of previously filed disclosures regarding the
components of the Companys deferred tax assets. The restatement has no effect
on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of
the Company.

1. Nature
of Business and Basis of Presentation
Ezenia! Inc. Ezenia or the Company operates in
one business segment, which is the design, development, manufacturing,
marketing and sale of conferencing and real-time collaboration solutions for
corporate and governmental networks and eBusiness. Founded in 1991, Ezenia! develops and markets
products that enable organizations to provide high-quality group communication
and collaboration capabilities to commercial, governmental, consumer and
institutional users. Ezenias products allow individuals and groups, regardless
of proximity constraints, to interact and share information in a natural,
spontaneous wayvoice-to-voice, face-to-face, mouse-to-mouse,
keyboard-to-keyboard, flexibly, securely and in real-time. Using our products, individuals can interact
through a natural meeting experience, allowing groups to work together
effectively and disseminate vital information quickly in a secure environment.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of Ezenia and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company
transactions and balances have been eliminated. All assets and liabilities of
Ezenias foreign subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange at the end
of the year, while sales and expense are translated at the average rate in
effect during the year. The net effect of these translation adjustments has
been immaterial.
Certain amounts in 2003
have been reclassified to permit comparison with 2005 and 2004 classifications.
2. Managements
Plans
Ezenias
success in achieving its goal of showing consistent quarterly top line and
bottom line growth is largely dependent on whether it can continue to grow its
future order bookings, and related revenue targets. Prior to 2004, Ezenia incurred substantial
recurring operating losses and negative cash flow from operations and incurred
an accumulated deficit of approximately $603 million at December31, 2003.
During 2005 and 2004, Ezenia achieved income from operations of $35 million and
$18 million, net income of $38 million and $32 million, and generated cash
from operations of $38 million and $32million respectively, and has
$94 million of cash and cash equivalents as of December31, 2005. Accordingly, largely as a result of its
successive quarters of profitability, management believes, although there can
be no assurances, that its existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund
its anticipated working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the
next twelve months. We anticipate that we will continue to generate positive
cash flow from operations for 2006 and that existing cash reserves will
therefore be sufficient to meet our working and capital requirement needs
during this period.
3. Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, if any, at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 30  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
Revenue recognition
Product revenue consists of sales of InfoWorkSpace IWS
software licenses and maintenance agreements, IWS product related training,
installation, and consulting, and video products. Revenue from sales of IWS
software licenses and maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the
subscription software license contract periods, which are generally one year,
pursuant to the guidance provided by Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2, issued by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA. Revenue from
IWS training, installation, and consulting services are recognized as the
services are performed provided there is vendor specific objective evidence
VSOE of fair value which is the price charged when the services are sold
separately. Revenue from video product sales is recognized upon shipment to the
customer and the fulfillment of all contractual terms and conditions, pursuant
to the guidance provided by Staff Accounting Bulletin No104, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements SAB 104,
issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Product development revenue relates to contracts
involving customization of the IWS product according to customer
specifications. Revenue associated with contracts for product development
revenue with milestone-based deliverables requiring a customers acceptance is
recognized upon the customers acceptance in accordance with terms of the
contract, in conformity with the guidance provided by SOP 81-1, Accounting For Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production
Type Contracts issued by the AICPA. The associated cost recognition
with these deliverables or milestones is deferred until the terms of acceptance
are satisfied and revenue is recognized.
Service revenue represents sales of service contracts
related to the maintenance of video products. Maintenance revenue is deferred
and recognized ratably over the term of the applicable agreement.
Products and software licenses are sold without any
contractual right of return by the customer. Deferred revenue represents
amounts received from customers under subscription software licenses,
maintenance agreements, or for product sales in advance of revenue recognition.
Judgments are required in evaluating the creditworthiness of our customers. In
all instances, revenue is not recognized until we have determined, at the
outset of the arrangement that collectibility is reasonably assured. Amounts
billed to customers related to shipping and handling charges are recorded as
revenue upon shipment and the related costs are included in cost of goods sold.
Product Warranties
Our products are sold with warranty provisions that
require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of our products
over a period of 90 days, at no cost to our customers. Our policy is to
establish warranty reserves at the time of sale when our estimates of the costs
that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements become material.
At December31, 2005, we believe that our future cost of materials, labor
and overhead for the servicing of our products sold through that date are not
material and no reserve is warranted. If actual product failures or material or
service delivery costs differ from our estimates, our warranty liability would
need to be revised accordingly.
Third Party
Technology
Ezenias IWS product incorporates third party
technology in the form of software licenses, which we purchase from other
software vendors. Software licenses purchased from vendors are reported as
prepaid licenses and amortized to cost of revenue over the subscription period,
which is generally one year. 31  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
Advertising
Advertising
costs are included in sales and marketing expense. Ezenia uses its website as
its main form of advertising along with participating in various industry
related trade shows and currently does not incur material advertising costs.
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense approximated
$49 thousand in fiscal 2005 and $39 thousand in fiscal 2004. Ezenia did not
incur advertising expense for fiscal 2003.
Cash equivalents
Ezenia considers all
liquid investments with a maturity of 90 days or less at the date of purchase
to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of
highly rated U.S. and state government securities, commercial paper and
short-term money market funds.
Financial
instruments and concentrations of credit risk
Ezenias financial instruments consist primarily of
cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, accounts payable and accrued
expenses. The carrying value of these financial instruments approximates fair
value due to their short term to maturity. Financial instruments, which
potentially subject Ezenia to concentrations of credit risk, are cash
equivalents and accounts receivable.
Major financial institutions maintain all the Companys
cash equivalents. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts
receivable is limited to certain customers to whom Ezenia makes substantial
sales. To reduce risk, we routinely assess the financial strength of our customers.
Ezenia maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on accounts past due
according to contractual terms and historical collection experience. Actual
losses when incurred are charged to the allowance. Write-offs related to
accounts receivable have been within managements expectations.
Revenue from one customer
accounted for approximately 20% of total revenues in 2005, 33% of total
revenues in 2004, and 38% of total revenues in 2003. Accounts receivable from
this customer amounted to approximately $18 million, $18 million and $19
million at December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Revenue from
international markets was approximately $362 thousand, $391 thousand and $11
million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Equipment and
improvements
Equipment
and improvements are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line
method over the following estimated useful lives 
Computer software and
equipment
3 years
Office equipment
5 years
Furniture and fixtures
5 years
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of lease term or estimated useful life
Repairs and maintenance
costs are expensed as incurred. 32  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
Research and
development costs
Research and development
costs are charged to expense as incurred. Internally developed software costs
are expensed as incurred until it is determined that the technology needed to
achieve performance requirements exists. To date, internally developed software
has been available for release concurrent with the establishment of
technological feasibility and, accordingly, costs eligible for capitalization
have been insignificant and expensed as incurred.
Income taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined at
the end of each year based on the future tax consequences that can be
attributed to net operating loss and credit carryovers as well as the
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax
benefits will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets is
dependant upon the generation of future taxable income. In determining the
valuation allowance, we consider past performance, expected future taxable
income, and qualitative factors which we consider to be appropriate to be
considered in estimating future taxable income. The Companys forecast of
expected future taxable income is for future periods that can be reasonably
estimated. Results that differ materially from our current expectations may cause
us to change our judgment on future taxable income. These changes, if any, may
require us to adjust our existing tax valuation allowance higher or lower than
the amount we have recorded.
In the fourth quarter of 2005, as a result of our
assessment of future taxable income, we released approximately $138 thousand of
valuation allowance against deferred tax assets resulting in a net tax benefit
of approximately $91 thousand. The calculation of tax liabilities involves
significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the
application of complex tax laws.
Net income loss
per share
The Company reports net income loss per share in
accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No128,
Earnings per Share. Diluted earnings
per share include the effect of dilutive stock options.

Accounting for
stock-based compensation
Ezenia has elected to account for its stock-based
compensation plans pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,
APB 25 and related interpretations rather than the alternative fair value
accounting provided under SFAS No123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No123. Ezenia has
recognized no compensation expense related to its stock option plans and its
stock purchase plan. 33  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
Pro-forma information regarding net income loss and
income loss per share, as if we had used the fair value method pursuant to SFAS
No123 to account for stock options issued under our various stock option
plans, and shares purchased under the 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as
amended, is presented below. The fair
value of stock activity under these plans was estimated at the date of grant
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions as of
the date of grant: risk-free interest rates equal to the then available rate
for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the
expected life of the options; no dividend yields; an average volatility factor
of the expected market price of Ezenias common stock over the expected life of
the option of 150 in 2005, 124 in 2004 and 182 in 2003; and a
weighted-average expected life of the option of
68 years in 2005, 64 years in 2004 and 74 years in 2003.
For
purposes of pro-forma disclosures, the estimated weighted average grant date
fair value of options granted during the year of $144, $053 and $019 in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, is amortized to expense over the related
vesting period. Pro-forma information is as follows

Recent Accounting
pronouncements
In December2004, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment SFAS
123R. This Statement is a revision of SFAS 123 and supersedes APB 25 and its related
implementation guidance. SFAS 123R establishes standards for transactions in
which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. This
standard requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services
received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date
fair value of the award. This eliminates the exception to account for such
awards using the intrinsic method previously allowable under APB Opinion No. 25.
In March2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC released Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB 107, Share-Based Payment, which expresses views of
the SEC Staff about the application of SFAS No123R. SFAS No. 123R was to
be effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning on or after June15,
2005, but in April2005 the SEC issued a rulethat SFAS No123R
will be effective only for annual reporting periods beginning on or after June15,
2005.
The Company is required to
adopt SFAS 123R on January1, 2006 and under the modified-prospective
transition method, the adoption is expected to materially increase stock
compensation expense and decrease earnings. Accordingly, in fiscal 2006, total
stock-based compensation expense from stock options using the fair value provisions
of SFAS 123R, is estimated to be approximately $800  34  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
thousand.
In order to develop the fiscal 2006 stock-based compensation expense estimate,
we utilized assumptions on items such as projected option grants and expected
life and volatility, which were similar to the amounts in fiscal 2005. In
addition, SFAS 123R requires that the excess tax benefits related to stock
compensation be reported as a cash inflow from financing activities rather than
as a reduction of taxes paid in cash from operations.
4. Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of finished goods
relating to legacy video conferencing hardware equipment Historically, as a
designer, developer and manufacturer of videoconferencing hardware solutions,
Ezenia was exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could
result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of
anticipated usage. Our policy is to establish inventory reserves when
conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated
demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our
products and market conditions. When recorded, our reserves are intended to
reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value.
Ezenia has previously provided for excess and
obsolescence reserve for 100% of its inventory due to the continued decline in
demand relating to the legacy videoconferencing product line. During each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2005 Ezenia was able to
realize sales of its legacy videoconferencing hardware products. The cost of
these product sales was offset by adjustments to reduce the related inventory
reserves. At December31, 2005 and 2004, our net inventory reserves are
approximately $45million.
5. Equipment and
Improvements
Property
and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over
the useful lives of the respective assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized
over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the
remaining lease term. Ezenia made no purchases of equipment or improvements in
the year ended December31, 2003. For the years ended December31,
2005 and December31, 2004, we had the following activity net of

The amount reported as current income tax benefit in
2005 is comprised of current income tax expense of approximately $47 thousand
in estimated federal alternative minimum tax expense and state income tax
expense and, a deferred tax benefit of approximately $138 thousand associated
with the release of a portion of the Companys valuation allowance. The amount
reported as income tax benefit in 2004 is the result of an $819 thousand net
settlement reached with the ITC and a $608 thousand refund received in
connection with the 2002 carry back of net operating losses incurred in 2001.
The amount reported as income tax benefit in 2003 is the result of the reversal
of tax reserves recorded in prior years.
A
reconciliation of the expected income tax benefit computed using the federal
statutory income tax rate to the Companys effective income tax rate at December31
for the years ended 2005, 2004, and 2003 is as follows

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act was
signed into law on October22, 2004. The Act contains numerous amendments
and additions to the U.S. corporate income tax rules. None of these changes,
either individually or in the aggregate, is expected to have a significant
effect on Ezenias income tax liability. The Company is continuing to evaluate
the Act and does not expect to complete this evaluation until after Congress
and the Treasury Department provide guidance clarifying certain provisions.

At December31, 2005, Ezenia had domestic federal
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $531 million available to
reduce future taxable income, which expire at various dates beginning in 2020
through 2025. Ezenia also has federal research and development tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $24 million available to reduce future tax
liabilities. Ezenia has state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$532 million as of December31, 2005 available to reduce state future
taxable income, which expire at various dates beginning in 2005 through 2010.
Ezenia also has state research and development tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $918 thousand as of December31, 2005.
Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code,
certain substantial changes in the Companys ownership may result in a
limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and research and
development credit carryforwards which may be utilized annually to offset
future taxable income and taxes payable.
As required by SFAS No109,
management of the Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence
bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets, which are comprised
principally of NOL carryforwards, research and experimentation credit
carryforwards, capitalized start up expenditures, purchased intangibles, and
research and development expenditures amortizable over sixty months. Management
has determined at this time that it is more likely than not that the Company
will recognize a portion of the benefits of its federal and state deferred tax
assets. Accordingly, in 2005 a provision for current income tax of
approximately $47 thousand relating primarily to federal alternative minimum
taxes was recorded, which was offset by the release of a valuation allowance of
approximately $138 thousand in the fourth quarter. As a result, a valuation
allowance of approximately $319 million has been established at December31,
2005, resulting in a net deferred tax asset of approximately $138 thousand. The
amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be reduced or
increased in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the
carryforward period change. 37  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 6. Income taxes Continued
Restatement of 2004
and 2003 deferred tax items In connection with the Companys review of income tax
returns previously filed in relation to our disclosures relative to certain
temporary differences we have restated certain of the deferred tax asset
amounts and corresponding valuation allowance from our previously filed Form
10-Ks for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. While the adjustments individually are
material to our tax disclosures there was no impact to our balance sheet,
statement of operations, stockholders equity or cash flows. Accordingly, the following represents the
restated amounts as compared to amounts previously disclosed in our prior Form
10-K.

The restatements in 2003 were primarily related to a
$2,851 thousand understatement of state net operating loss carryforwards, an
understatement of cumulative temporary differences related to purchased
intangibles of $259 thousand and of various reserves, accruals and allowances
of $1,713 thousand offset by an overstatement of tax credit carryforwards of
$1,448 thousand. The 2004 restatements
relate primarily to a $527 thousand understatement of federal net operating
losses offset by a $376 thousand overstatement of tax credit carryforwards.
As a result of these
restatements to the aforementioned deferred tax items a restated reconciliation
of the expected income tax benefit computed using the federal statutory
income tax rate to the Companys effective income tax rate for the years 2004
and 2003 is as follows

Ezenia had previously
settled a patent infringement suit against Accord in the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts. The settlement agreement, provided,
among other things, that Ezenia receive $65 million in return for a covenant
not to sue with respect to the patents that were the subject of the litigation.
Ezenia received the payment in 2000, net of foreign tax withholding of $975housand,
pending a resolution of certain tax matters related to the settlement with the
tax authorities in Israel. In April2004, Ezenia reached a settlement
agreement with the Israel Tax Commission ITC, resulting in the receipt by
Ezenia of cash proceeds related to the disputed amount, net of interest earned,
tax withholding, and settlement fees of approximately $179 thousand.
8. Commitments
and Contingencies
Ezenias contractual
obligations relate primarily to its facilities leases and a contractual
purchase commitment. In 2005, Ezenia moved its headquarters facility from
Burlington, Massachusetts to Nashua, New Hampshire and incurred a $170 thousand
lease termination fee. The primary facility in Nashua, New Hampshire is leased under
an operating lease, which expires in June2010. We also have three other
leases for office space in the United States, located in Colorado Springs,
Colorado, Sterling, Virginia, and Alexandria, Virginia for sales, development
and technical support operations. On February28, 2005 we entered into a
new five year operating lease to move our Alexandria, Virginia sales and
service office to a new facility in Sterling, Virginia. At the same time, we
entered into a sublease agreement to lease our Alexandria, Virginia facility
for the remaining 14 months of our lease term. As a result of the move, we will
lower our overall facility costs in Virginia. These leases expire at various
dates through November2011. Rent expense was approximately $199 thousand 278thousand, and $361 thousand in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

represent obligations under agreements, which are not unilaterally cancelable
by us, are legally enforceable and specify fixed or minimum amounts of goods or
services at fixed or minimum prices. If order bookings are less than expected
in 2006, it is possible that we will be unable to meet our minimum purchase
commitment resulting in a possible material adjustment later in the year.
Ezenia is subject to a
variety of claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course
of its business. Currently
we are not a defendant in any claims or suits. As of December31, 2004, Ezenia
had reserved approximately $160 thousand for potential liabilities that we
expected to incur as a result of lawsuits filed during the fourth quarter of
2004. During the quarter ended June30, 2005, we resolved these suits for
approximately $15 thousand and therefore reversed the excess accrual of
approximately $145thousand, which is included as a credit in general and
administrative expense as a change in estimate. 39 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued
9. Stockholders
Equity
The Company has authorized 2,000,000 shares of
undesignated Preferred Stock. Each series of Preferred Stock shall have such
rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights,
dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation
preferences as determined by the Board of Directors.
In connection with the
Companys prior acquisition of the IWS business unit we issued
400,000shares of our common stock of which 290,000 of those shares were
subject to a put right by the seller of the IWS business unit. Such common
stock subject to the put right was reported as temporary equity. In July 2003,
in connection with an amendment to a software development agreement, the seller
agreed to estimate its put right and, accordingly, the $29million value
associated with the 290,000 shares of common stock that was no longer subject
to the put option, was credited to stockholders equity.

12. Subsequent
events
On February7, 2006, Ezenia entered into an
agreement amending its operating lease for its sales and service facility
located in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Under the agreement, an additional 2,010
square feet of space was added to the premises and the term of the lease was
extended an additional five years.
On February17, 2006,
Ezenia received a favorable ruling on its Motion for Summary Judgment on two
claims brought against Datacraft Mexico, S.A. Datacraft for breach of
contract. The claims stem from a balance due of approximately $276 thousand for
the delivery of goods to Datacraft in 2002 and 2003. The Company expects, as a
result of this ruling, to have these claims settled in 2006. 42
