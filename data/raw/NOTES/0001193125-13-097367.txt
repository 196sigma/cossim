Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies 
Description of Business Deltic Timber Corporation
Deltic or the Company is a natural resources company engaged primarily in the growing and harvesting of timber and the manufacture and marketing of lumber. Deltic owns approximately 453,200 acres of timberland, primarily in
Arkansas and north Louisiana. The Companys sawmill operations are located at Ola in central Arkansas and at Waldo in south Arkansas. In addition to its timber and lumber operations, the Company is engaged in real estate development in central
Arkansas. The Company also holds a 50 percent interest in Del-Tin Fiber, LLC Del-Tin Fiber, a joint venture to manufacture and market medium density fiberboard MDF. 
Business Environment The Company is primarily a wood
products producer operating in a commodity-based business environment with a major diversification in real estate development. This environment is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions, interest rates, credit
availability, imports, foreign exchange rates, housing starts, new and existing housing inventory, foreclosures, residential repair and remodeling, commercial construction, industry capacity and production levels, the availability of contractors for
logging, hauling, and shipping, the availability of raw materials, costs of fuel, and weather conditions. 
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial
statements of Deltic Timber Corporation include the accounts of Deltic, all majority-owned subsidiaries, and any variable interest entities of which it is the primary beneficiary. Equity investments and joint ventures are accounted for under the
equity method if it is determined that the Company does not have control of the entity. Significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 
Use of Estimates In the preparation of the Companys financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management has made a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 
Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents include
investments that have a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase. 
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Bad Debt
The Company records trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to
the provision for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based upon review of specific receivables outstanding and considers factors such as current overall economic conditions, industry-specific economic conditions, historical customer performance,
and anticipated customer performance. In the consolidated statements of income, bad debt expense is included in cost of sales. Charges to bad debt expense were $133,000, $63,000, and $56,000 in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. At
December31, 2012 and 2011, the balance in the allowance account was $127,000 and $65,000, respectively. 
Inventories Inventories of logs, lumber, and supplies are stated at
the lower of cost or market within Deltics operating areas, primarily using the average cost method. Log costs include harvest and transportation cost as appropriate. Lumber costs include materials, labor, and production overhead. For
additional information, see Note 2 Inventories. 
Investment in Real Estate Held for Development
and Sale Real estate held for development and sale includes direct costs of land and land development and indirect costs, including amenities. Indirect and amenity costs are allocated to individual lots or acreage sold based on relative
retail sales value. Direct costs are allocated to a specific neighborhood or commercial real estate tract, while indirect costs for the Companys three development area Chenal Valley, Chenal Downs, and Red Oak Ridge are allocated
to neighborhoods over the entire respective development area based on relative retail sales values.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2012 
Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies cont.  Investment in Del-Tin Fiber Investment in Del-Tin
Fiber, a 50 percent-owned limited liability company, is accounted for using the equity method and evaluated for possible impairment, as applicable under the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards
Codification ASC 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures. Management has determined there is no control by either 50 percent owner and therefore, accounts for Del-Tin Fiber under the equity method. Cash advances to the
joint venture are recorded as increases in the Companys investment carrying value, while cash repayments received from the joint venture result in reductions in investment carrying value. For additional information, see Note 4 
Investment in Del-Tin Fiber. 
Timber and Timberlands Timber and timberlands, which
includes timberland, fee timber, purchased stumpage inventory, and logging facilities, are stated at cost, less the cost of fee timber harvested and accumulated depreciation of logging facilities, and include no estimated future reforestation cost.
The cost of timber consists of fee timber acquired and reforestation costs, which includes site preparation, seedlings, and labor. The cost of fee timber harvested is based on the volume of timber harvested in relation to the estimated volume of
timber recoverable. Logging facilities, which consist primarily of roads constructed and other land improvements, are depreciated using the straight-line method over a ten-year estimated life. The Company estimates its fee timber inventory using
statistical information and data obtained from physical measurements and other information gathering techniques. Fee timber carrying costs, commercial thinning, silviculture, and timberland management costs are expensed as incurred. 
The Company classifies its timberlands and fee timber as either strategic or non-strategic. Strategic timberland, including pine forest
and pine plantations, is prime pine sawtimber growing platforms located within or immediately adjacent to the Company sawmills operating regions. Deltic manages these acres using modern silviculture methods to achieve optimal volume and
quality of its pine sawtimber. The Company harvests sawtimber and pulpwood in accordance with its harvest plans and generally converts sawtimber into lumber in its own sawmills and sells pulpwood in the market. Upon harvest, strategic timberlands
are reforested. The Companys timberland acquisition program is focused on the acquisition of pine-growing timberland in its current operating regions. The Company considers the acquisition and the occasional sale of strategic timberlands as
investing activities. The Company has legacy hardwood and other acreage which cannot be either harvested for conversion in Company sawmills, reforested as pine plantations, managed efficiently using modern silviculture methods due to the size of the
tract or proximity to other Deltic fee timberlands, or all three. These timberlands have been identified as non-strategic and/or higher and better use timberlands and are expected to be sold over time. The Woodlands segment manages an annual program
to sell a portion of these non-strategic timberlands and/or harvest hardwoods for the sale to third parties. The Company considers this program as an operating activity of its Woodlands segment. 
In order to acquire and sell assets, primarily timberlands, in a tax efficient manner, the Company enters into like-kind exchange
LKE tax-deferred transactions when possible. The Company generally enters into forward transactions, in which property is sold and the proceeds are reinvested by acquiring similar property; and reverse transactions, in which property
is acquired and similar property is subsequently sold. A qualified LKE intermediary is used to facilitate LKE transactions. Proceeds from forward LKE transactions are held by the intermediary and are classified as restricted cash because the funds
must be reinvested in similar properties. If the acquisition of suitable LKE 
49 Table of Contents DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION 
AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2012 
Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies cont. 
properties is not completed within 180 days of the sale of the company-owned property, the proceeds are distributed to Deltic by the intermediary and are reclassified as available cash, and
applicable income taxes are determined. Amounts deposited with a third party towards the potential future purchase of property are included in other investments and non-current receivables in the consolidated balance sheets and as an investing
activity as changes in funds held by trustee in the consolidated statements of cash flows. At December31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had $7,000 and $567,000, respectively, of proceeds from land sales deposited with a LKE intermediary. An
exchange accommodation titleholder, a type of variable interest entity, is used to facilitate reverse like-kind exchanges. The acquired assets are held by the exchange accommodation titleholder until the exchange transactions are complete. If the
Company determines that it is the primary beneficiary of the exchange accommodation titleholder, Deltic includes the assets held by the exchange accommodation titleholder in timber and timberlands assets on the consolidated balance sheets and
recognizes any income or expense attributed to the property in the consolidated income statements. 
Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant,
and equipment assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of buildings, equipment, and other depreciable assets is primarily determined using the straight-line method. Expenditures that substantially improve and/or increase
the useful life of facilities or equipment are capitalized. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Gains and losses on disposals or retirements are recognized in the period they occur. 
Property, plant, and equipment assets are evaluated for possible impairment on a specific asset basis or in groups of similar assets, as
applicable, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated
undiscounted future net cash flows to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair
value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and depreciation ceases. 
Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when
the following criteria are met: 1 persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, 2delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, 3the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable, and 4collectability is reasonably
assured. Delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Revenue from the sale of lumber and wood by-products is recorded at the time of shipment due to terms of such sale
being designated free on board f.o.b. shipping point. Revenue from the sale of timber-cutting rights to third parties is recorded when legal title passes to the purchaser, which is generally upon delivery of a legally executed timber
deed and receipt of payment for the timber. Revenue from intersegment timber sales is recorded when the timber is harvested; such intersegment sales, which are made at prices which generally approximate market within Deltics operating area,
are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Revenue from the leasing of land for hunting purposes is deferred
when received and subsequently recognized over the one-year lease term, which begins September1. At December31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had deferred hunting lease revenue totaling $1,562,000 and $1,491,000, respectively, reflected in
the consolidated balance sheets in deferred revenues and other accrued liabilities. Revenue from mineral lease rental payments is deferred when received and recognized ratably over the lease term. At December31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had
deferred mineral lease revenue of $3,721,000 and $5,339,000, respectively, of which $2,064,000 and $3,284,000 is 
50 Table of Contents DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION

Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies cont. 
included in other noncurrent liabilities for 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $1,657,000 and $2,055,000 is included in other current liabilities, respectively. Mineral royalty payments are
recognized when received. Revenue from sales of timberland and real estate is recorded when the sale is closed and legal title is transferred and the buyers initial and continuing investment is adequate, which is generally at the time the
purchaser executes the real estate closing documents and makes payment to the title company handling the closing. 
Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of
accounting for income taxes. Under this method, the provision for income taxes includes amounts currently payable and amounts deferred as tax assets and liabilities, based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax
bases of existing assets and liabilities, and is measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance which is established when it is
more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The
Company continuously reviews state and federal tax returns for uncertain tax provisions. Tax benefits are recorded if it is more-likely-than-not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, and liabilities are
recorded if it is deemed less likely that the position taken would prevail. These liabilities are adjusted in the period in which it is determined that the issue is settled with the relevant taxing authority, the expiration of statute of limitation
for a tax year in question, a change in tax laws, or other facts become known. 
Property Taxes Property taxes applicable to the Companys
assets are estimated and accrued in the period of assessment. At December31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had accrued property tax expense totaling $1,783,000 and $1,782,000, respectively, reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in accrued
taxes other than income taxes. 
Share-Based Compensation 
The Company applies a fair value-based measurement method in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees, recognizing the cost as the services are performed. For additional information, see Note 16 Incentive Plans. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits
The Company sponsors both qualified and nonqualified, noncontributory, defined benefit retirement plans that cover substantially all employees. Benefits are based on years of service and final career-average-pay formulas as defined by the
plans. The qualified plan is funded to accumulate sufficient assets to provide for accrued benefits. The nonqualified plan, a supplemental executive plan, is not funded; payments to retirees due under this plan are made on a monthly basis.
The Company also sponsors a defined benefit health care plan and a life insurance benefit plan for substantially all retired
employees. The Company measures the costs of its obligations for these plans based on its health care cost trends and actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, mortality rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, and turnover
rates. The Company reviews its assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so. The effect of modifications to those assumptions is recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income/loss and amortized to net periodic cost over future periods using the corridor method. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its
experience and market conditions. Net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn these
post retirement benefits. For additional information, see Note 15 Employee and Retiree Benefit Plans.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2012 
Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies cont.  Advertising Costs Advertising costs, primarily related to
marketing efforts for the Companys real estate developments, are expensed as incurred. These costs amounted to $732,000 in 2012, $768,000 in 2011, and $982,000 in 2010, and are reflected in the consolidated statements of income. 
Capitalized Interest The Company capitalizes
interest for qualifying assets during construction by applying the Companys capitalization rate to the average amount of accumulated expenditures for the asset during the period. Interest is most often capitalized as an indirect cost for real
estate development in the Companys real estate operations. For additional information, see Note 17 Supplemental Cash Flows Disclosures. 
Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures include
additions to investment in real estate held for development and sale; timber and timberlands; and property, plant, and equipment. 
Net Change in Purchased Stumpage Inventory 
Purchased stumpage inventory consists of timber-cutting rights purchased from third parties specifically for use in the Companys sawmills. Depending on the timing of acquisition and usage of this acquired stumpage inventory, the net change in
this inventory can either be a source or use of cash in the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows. 
Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per share is
computed using the two-class method and is based on earnings available to common shareholders less accrued preferred dividends, if any, and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The diluted earnings per share amounts are computed
based on earnings available to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, including shares assumed to be issued under the Companys stock incentive plans using the treasury-stock method, unless
anti-dilutive. For a reconciliation of amounts used in per share computations, see Note 18 Earnings per Share. 
Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling
costs, such as freight to our customers destinations, are included in cost of sales in the Companys consolidated statements of income. These costs, when included in the amount invoiced to customers, are also recognized in net sales. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The
Company evaluates its transactions to determine if any variable interest entities exist. If it is determined that Deltic is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, that entity is consolidated into Deltics financial statements. Effect of Recently Issued Authoritative Accounting
Guidance Financial Accounting Standards Update No2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS Topic
820, became effective January1, 2012, for the Company. The guidance resulted in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS standards. The adoption of this guidance had little impact on the
Companys consolidated financial statements.

Note 4 Investment in Del-Tin Fiber 
Deltic owns 50 percent of the membership of Del-Tin Fiber, which operates a medium density fiberboard plant near El
Dorado, Arkansas. At December31, 2012 and 2011, the Companys share of the underlying net assets of Del-Tin Fiber
exceeded its investment by $14,162,000 and $14,958,000, respectively. The difference relates primarily to the Companys write-off of its carrying amount for its investment in Del-Tin Fiber as of
53 Table of Contents DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION 
AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2012 
Note 4 Investment in Del-Tin Fiber cont. 
December31, 2002, which was not recorded by Del-Tin Fiber. The equity in earnings of Del-Tin Fiber recognized by the Company exceeds its ownership percentage of Del-Tin Fibers
earnings because the difference in basis between the Company and Del-Tin Fiber is being adjusted to account for Del-Tin Fibers operating results as if it were a consolidated subsidiary. 
Cumulative net losses for Del-Tin Fiber have amounted to $75,541,000, of which $37,770,000 is the Companys share. As of
December31, 2012, the Companys total contributions to Del-Tin Fiber, net of repayments, are $58,225,000. During 2012, 2011, and 2010, net repayments of $1,780,000, $1,453,000, and $4,913,000, respectively, were received from Del-Tin
Fiber. On August26, 2004, the Company executed a guarantee agreement in connection with the refinancing of the debt of
Del-Tin Fibers long-term bond obligation. Del-Tin Fiber has issued a letter of credit in support of the bond obligation, and both Deltic and the other joint venture partner agreed to guarantee Del-Tin Fibers performance under the letter
of credit since inception. The Companys guarantee under the letter of credit expires on August31, 2016. In connection with the issuance of Deltics original guarantee of the letter of credit, the fair value of the guarantee of the
bonds was determined to be immaterial. In reviewing the payment and performance risk associated with this guarantee, Deltic continues to consider the risk minimal based on Del-Tins balance sheet, past performance, and length of time remaining
on the guarantee. On February13, 2012, International Paper Company completed its acquisition of Temple-Inland, Inc.,
Deltics joint venture partner in Del-Tin Fiber. Temple-Inland, Inc. is now a wholly owned subsidiary of International Paper Company. The acquisition did not change the operating agreement of Del-Tin Fiber. 
Under the operating agreement, Del-Tin Fibers employees operate the plant. Deltic negotiates annually to provide a portion of the
plants fiber and wood fuel supply at market prices. During 2012, 2011, and 2010, Deltic sold to Del-Tin Fiber approximately $3,652,000, $3,654,000, and $4,449,000, respectively, of these lumber manufacturing by-products. As of
December31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had receivables from Del-Tin Fiber of $119,000 and $54,000, respectively. Del-Tin

In 1999, the Company initiated a program to identify and sell non-strategic timberlands and use the sales proceeds to
purchase pine timberlands that are strategic to its operations. In 2008, Deltic identified approximately 10,000 acres of non-strategic timberlands that existed within its timberland base to be sold. Other non-strategic acreage exists within the
Companys land base, but Deltic has not completely identified the number of acres that fit within this category. As the Company identifies these acres and determines they are either smaller tracts of pine timberland that cannot be strategically
managed or tracts of hardwood bottomland that cannot be converted into pine growing acreage, they will be sold. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, approximately 700 acres and 2,500 acres, respectively were available for sale. Included in the
Woodlands operating income are gains from sales of non-strategic timberland of $1,910,000, $2,797,000, and $4,782,000 in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Occasionally Deltic engages in land-for-land exchanges that are recorded as sales due to the
nature of the land involved. No gains were recognized from non-monetary land exchanges in 2012, but $47,000 and $71,000 were recognized in 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Note 9 Credit Facilities 
The Company has an agreement with SunTrust Bank together with other banks, which provides an unsecured and committed
revolving credit facility totaling $297,500,000 and includes an option to request an increase in the amount of aggregate revolving commitments by $50,000,000. The most recent amendment of this credit facility occurred on February4, 2011, and
expires on September9, 2015. To facilitate the amendment, $1,094,000 in fees were incurred and are being amortized as additional interest over the term of the agreement, together with the remaining unamortized prior costs of $266,000. At
December31, 2012 and 2011, $23,000,000 and $24,000,000, respectively, were outstanding and included in long-term debt. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, $274,500,000 and $273,500,000, respectively, were available in excess of all
borrowings outstanding under or supported by the respective facilities. Borrowings under the current agreement bear interest at a base rate or an adjusted Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin, depending upon the type of loan the Company
executes. The applicable margin component of the interest rate varies with the type of loan and the Companys total debt to capital ratio. The agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants, including a leverage ratio of no greater
than 65 to 10, minimum timber market value greater than 175 percent of outstanding total senior indebtedness, and limitations on the incurrence of debt. Fees associated with the current revolving credit facility include a commitment fee of 25 to.40 percent per annum on the unused portion of the committed amount. The Company may also borrow up to $1,000,000 under a
short-term credit facility with BancorpSouth. The agreement expires December31, 2013, with annual renewal. The amount available to the Company under this facility is reduced by any borrowings by the Company. As of December31, 2012 and
2011, Deltic had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit, resulting in $1,000,000 available to the Company. Borrowings bear interest based upon the New York Prime rate. Deltic also has an agreement with BancorpSouth to provide letters of
credit. New letters of credit are requested by the Company and are approved and issued by BancorpSouth on a case-by-case basis. Outstanding letters of credit as of December31, 2012 and 2011 were $719,000 and $654,000, respectively.

Notes. No installment payments are required, but the terms allow for prepayments at the option of the Company. The agreement contains 
57 Table of Contents DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2012 
Note 10 Indebtedness cont. 
certain restrictive financial covenants, including a minimum consolidated net worth of the sum of $175,567,000, plus 50 percent of net income accrued during each quarter thereafter commencing
after December31, 2006, plus 100 percent of the net proceeds from any public or private offering of common or preferred stock of the Company, a maximum funded debt to capitalization ratio of 6 to 1, a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less
than 25 to 1, and a requirement to maintain a timber market value greater than 200 percent of outstanding total senior indebtedness. As of December31, 2012, the scheduled maturities of long-term debt for the next four years are none in 2013 and 2014, $23,000,000 in 2015, and $40,000,000 in 2016. For additional information
regarding financial instruments, see Note 9 Credit Facilities and Note 13 Fair Value of Financial Instruments. 
Some covenant requirements of the Senior Notes are the same as for the revolving credit facility, some are more restrictive, and some
apply only to the Senior Notes. The table below sets forth the most restrictive ratio requirements of the covenants for the
credit facility and Senior Notes Payable and the status with respect to these covenants as of December31, 2012 and 2011.  Covenants ActualRatiosat ActualRatiosat Requirements Dec. 31, 2012 Dec. 31, 2011 Leverage ratio should be less than:1 60to1 253to1 262to1 Total outstanding debt as a percentage of total debt allowed based on the minimum timber market value covenant:2 2 4415 4347 Fixed charge coverage ratio should be greater than:3 250to1 539 to 1 389 to 1

The leverage ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total capital. Total debt includes indebtedness for borrowed money, secured liabilities,
obligations in respect of letters of credit, and guarantees. Total capital is the sum of total debt and net worth. Net worth is calculated as total assets minus total liabilities, as reflected on the balance sheet. This covenant is applied at the
end of each quarter. The revolving credit facility requirement is for the leverage ratio to be less than 65 to 1.  2
Timber market value must be greater than 200 percent of total debt as defined in 1above. The timber market value is calculated by multiplying
the average price received for sales of timber for the preceding four quarters by the current quarters ending inventory of timber. This covenant is applied at the end of the quarter on a rolling four-quarter basis. The revolving credit
facility requirement is for the timber market value to be greater than 175 percent of total debt as defined in 1above.

Note 10 Indebtedness cont.  3
The fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated as EBITDA earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, and amortization increased by
non-cash compensation expense and other non-cash expenses and decreased by dividends paid and income tax paid, divided by the sum of interest expense and scheduled principal payments made on debt during the period. This covenant is applied at the
end of the quarter on a rolling four-quarter basis. This covenant only applies to the Senior Notes Payable. 
Based on managements current operating projections, the Company believes it will remain in compliance with the
debt covenants and have sufficient liquidity to finance operations and pay all obligations. However, depending on market conditions and the return of economic uncertainties, in future periods the Company could request amendments, or waivers for
covenants, or obtain refinancing in future periods. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain amendments or waivers or negotiate agreeable refinancing terms should it become necessary.

Net deferred tax assets 4,440 969 
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, Deltics management considers whether it is
more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the Companys total deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical
taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are anticipated to reverse, management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will realize the benefits of its deferred tax
assets at December31, 2012, as reductions of future taxable income or by utilizing available tax planning strategies. However, the amount of the net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of
taxable income are revised. Unrecognized tax benefits represent potential future obligations to taxing authorities if
uncertain tax positions the Company has taken, primarily on previously filed state income tax returns, are not sustained. Liabilities established for unrecognized tax benefits may not be combined with deferred tax assets or liabilities; however,
when the unrecognized tax benefit is directly associated with a tax position taken in a tax year that results or resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset for a Net Operating Loss NOL for that year and such NOL has not yet
been utilized, net presentation is appropriate.

If the Company were to prevail on all unrecognized tax benefits recorded on the balance sheet, approximately $780,000,
as of December31, 2012, would benefit the effective tax rate. The Companys policy is to recognize interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in other expenses. During 2012, the Company
recognized $166,000 in interest expense for these items. The Company had approximately $451,000 and $205,000 accrued in deferred revenue and other accrued liabilities for interest and penalties at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The
Company is no longer subject to federal and state income tax examination by tax authorities for years before 2009. 
Note 12 Stockholders Rights Plan 
The Company has a Stockholders Rights Plan Rights Plan, which provides for each eligible common
shareholder to receive a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right Right for each outstanding share of the Companys common stock held. On October19, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors amended the Rights Plan
to, among other items, extend its term to December31, 2016, and to increase the exercise price of the rights to $200 per share. The Rights will detach from the common stock and become exercisable: 1following a specified period of time
after the date of the first public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons Acquiring Person, has become the beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of the Companys common stock or 2following
a specified amount of time of the commencement of a tender or exchange offer by any Acquiring Person, which would, if consummated, result in such persons becoming the beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of the Companys common stock. In
either case, the detachment of the Rights from the common stock is subject to extension by a majority of the directors of the Company. The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects and will cause substantial dilution to any Acquiring Person that
attempts to acquire the Company without conditioning the offer on a substantial number of Rights being acquired. Other terms of the Rights are set forth in, and the foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by, the Rights Agreement between
the Company and Harris N.A. formerly known as Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as Rights Agent. 
Note 13 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Fair value measurement accounting establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure
fair value, with Level 1 being the highest quality and Level 3 being the lowest quality. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets on identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included in
Level 1. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect assumptions about pricing by market participants.

Information pertaining to the fair value of the pension plan assets is found in Note 15
Employee and Retiree Benefit Plans. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for liabilities
measured at fair value. Nonqualified Employee Savings Plan Consists of mutual funds, which are valued at the net
asset value of shares held by the plan at year-end, at quoted market prices. The fair value measurements for the
Companys financial liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis at December31, 2012 are presented in the following table:   December31 Quoted Prices  Inputs SignificantObservableInputs SignificantUnobservableInputs Thousands of dollars

following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments held by the Company at December31, 2012 and 2011. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be
exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. The table excludes financial instruments included in current assets and liabilities, except current maturities of long-term debt, all of which have fair values approximating carrying

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to credit risk are trade accounts receivable. These
receivables normally arise from the sale of wood products and real estate. Concentration of credit with respect to these trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large

number of customers comprising the Companys customer base. No single recurring customer accounted for a significant amount of the Companys sales of wood products or real estate in
2012, 2011, or 2010. At December31, 2012 and 2011, there was no significant accounts receivable from a single customer. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral to support
accounts receivable. 
Note 15 Employee and Retiree Benefit Plans 
The Company has a funded, qualified defined benefit retirement plan Retirement Plan that covers each
employee who completes 1,000 hours of service for a twelve-month period, once employment has commenced, and continues to meet both the 1,000 hours requirement and the employment requirement for each twelve-month period. An unfunded, nonqualified
supplemental executive retirement plan is maintained for certain current and former employees. All contributions to both plans are made by the Company. The plans provide defined benefits based on years of benefit service and average monthly
compensation as defined by the Companys Retirement Plan. The Company determines the vested benefit obligation on the actuarial present value based on the employees expected date of retirement. The Company also sponsors a plan for retired
employees that provides comprehensive healthcare benefits supplementing Medicare benefits for those eligible and life insurance benefits. Costs are accrued for this plan during the service lives of covered employees. Retirees contribute a portion
of the self-funded cost of healthcare benefits and the Company contributes the remainder. The Company pays premiums for life insurance coverage arranged through an insurance company. The health care plan is funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. The
Company retains the right to modify or terminate the benefits and/or cost-sharing provisions. United States health care legislation enacted in 2010 is expected to affect companies that offer postemployment benefits to employees. Based on
managements understanding of this legislation and the types of benefits currently offered by the Companys benefit plan, it is estimated that the financial impact to the Company will be immaterial.

will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $1,433,000 and $7,400, respectively. The plan amendment for the other defined benefit postretirement plans that will be
amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year is $199,000. 
The amount of projected expense of the qualified retirement plan is expected to be $2,644,000 for 2013. The Company expects to make
contributions during 2013 of approximately $1,200,000 to the qualified retirement plan, $236,000 to fund benefits paid from its nonqualified retirement plan, and approximately $410,000 to fund postretirement benefit plans. 
The discount rate assumption used by the Company to measure benefit obligations and net periodic expenses is based on the estimated
interest rate at which the benefit obligations of its plans can be settled. For 2012 and 2011, the Company used a discount rate durational study of Other Postretirement Employee Benefit OPEB liabilities to determine an appropriate
discount rate. To develop the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption, the Company considered the rates of
return of assets the Companys pension plan invested in and compared them to the historical rates of return on investments in similar assets. Further, these returns were compared to plans of other companies which had similar investment
philosophies. After a review of the rate of inflation and its impact, management made the selection of the 750 percent assumption. In determining the benefit obligation for health care at December31, 2012, health care inflation cost was assumed to increase at an annual rate of five percent in 2012. Assumed health care cost
trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plan. A one percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase the aggregate service and interest cost components of periodic benefit
cost for 2012 by $173,000 and the benefit obligation by $1,916,000, while a one percentage-point decrease in the assumed rate would decrease the 2012 cost components by $136,000 and the benefit obligation by $1,604,000.

Funded Plan The assets of the defined benefit plan, the
Plan, are contained in a trust, sponsored by Deltic, and administered by a trustee appointed by the Companys Pension Investment and Employees Benefits Committee. 
The investment policy of the Plan is to achieve growth with the preservation of principal. To achieve the goal of growth of plan assets
excluding contributions and withdrawals at a rate that exceeds inflation, a balanced portfolio consisting of equities, fixed income, and cash equivalents is maintained. The components of the portfolio must be securities that have readily available
prices and can be sold easily without significantly impacting the price of the securities. The minimum and maximum asset allocation levels, at market, for large cap equity is 40 to 60 percent, small cap equity is 5 to 15 percent, international
equity is zero to 20 percent, fixed income is 30 to 55 percent, and up to 5 percent in cash equivalents. The following types
of securities are permitted in the Plan.  Equities Common stocks, preferred stocks, convertible preferred stocks, convertible bonds, American depository receipts, proprietary funds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded
funds. Fixedincome U.S. government securities, corporate debt obligations, U.S. government agency securities, and mortgage-backed security issues. Cashequivalents U.S. government securities.
Not more than 25 percent of the market value of Plan assets may be held in the securities of any single
issuer with the exception of the U.S. government or its agencies. As of December31, 2012, less than three percent of the
total market value of the Plan assets were invested in mortgage-backed securities issues. Fair Value Measurement 
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for retirement plan assets measured at fair value. Common
stock, preferred securities, and exchange-traded funds: Valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded. Mutual funds and proprietary funds: Valued at the net asset value NAV of shares held by the Plan at year-end, at quoted market prices. 
Corporate debt obligations and U.S. government and agency securities: Valued using quoted prices for similar assets in active
markets; pricing models that utilize trade, bid, and other market information; or benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing. Money market funds: Valued at par, which approximates fair value. The
methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other
market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

Fair value measurement accounting establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the
quality of inputs used to measure fair value, with Level 1 being the highest quality and Level 3 being the lowest quality. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets on identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are observable inputs
other than quoted prices included in Level 1. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect assumptions about pricing by market participants. The following tables set forth by level within the fair value hierarchy, the Plans investments at fair value as of December31, 2012 and 2011.

to a specific percentage of their base pay. The Company matches contributions at a stated percentage of each employees allotment. Company contributions to this plan were $521,000 in 2012, $547,000 in 2011, and $551,000 in 2010. 
Note 16 Incentive Plans 
Stock Incentive Plan On April26, 2012, the Companys shareholders approved an amendment to extend the Deltic Timber Corporation 2002 Stock Incentive Plan the 2002 Plan for ten years to April26,
2022 and change the maximum number of shares which may be awarded in any calendar year as restricted stock and restricted stock units or other stock-based awards to 75,000 shares. The 2002 Plan replaced the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan the 1996
Plan, which was terminated. The 2002 Plan permits annual awards of shares of the Companys common stock to executives, other key employees, and nonemployee directors. Under the plan, the Executive Compensation Committee the
Committee is authorized to grant: 1stock options; 2restricted stock and restricted stock units; 3performance units; and 4other stock-based awards, including stock appreciation rights and rights to dividends and
dividend equivalents. The number of shares originally registered for issuance under the 2002 Plan was 1,800,000 shares. Additional shares maybe issued if an adjustment is determined necessary by the

committee as the result of dividend or other distribution, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase
or exchange of common stock, or other corporate transaction in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available. At December31, 2012, 949,396 of these 1,800,000 shares were available for
award under the 2002 Plan. No participant in the 2002 Plan may receive options and stock appreciation rights in any calendar year that relates to more than 50,000 shares, and the maximum number of shares, which may be awarded as restricted stock and
restricted stock units or other stock-based awards are 75,000 shares. The Company has a policy of issuing treasury stock to satisfy all share-based incentive plans. Under the fair value recognition provisions for share-based payments, share-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over
the requisite service period of the award. The fair value of stock options granted is determined using a binomial model. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined by reference to the fair market value of the Companys common stock
on the date of grant. Restricted stock performance units are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The benefits of tax deductions in excess of
recognized compensation cost is to be reported as a financing cash flow. Deltic issues restricted stock performance units
whose vesting is contingent upon meeting certain financial performance goals based upon the Companys total stockholder return compared to the total return of a Paper and Forest Products Index selected by the Committee and calculated by
Standard and Poors. Determining the appropriate amount to expense is based on likelihood of achievement of the stated goals and requires judgment, including forecasting future financial results. 
The Company uses historical volatility over a ten-year trading life to determine volatility assumptions. Risk-free interest rates are
based on historical rates and forward-looking factors. The expected dividend yield is based on the Companys average dividend yield from 2008 to 2011. The pre-vesting forfeiture rate is based on historical rates and forward-looking factors. The
expected option term is based on the term of the option and historical exercise and expiration experience. Assumptions for the
2012, 2011, and 2010 valuation of stock options and restricted stock performance units consisted of the following:  2012 2011 2010 Expected term of options in years 627 627 627 Weighted expected volatility 3878 3670 3457 Dividend yield 061 062 061 Risk-free interest rate - performance restricted shares 60 209 213 Risk-free interest rate - stock options 200 379 392 Stock price as of valuation date 6767 6354 4484 Restricted performance share valuation 9061 8556 5866 Grant date fair value - stock options 2492 2089 1449  70 Table of Contents DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION

The Companys four reporting segments consist of Deltics three operating business units and its corporate
function. Each reporting entity has a separate management team and infrastructure that offers different products and/or services. Woodlands operations manage the Companys Southern Pine timberlands located primarily in Arkansas and northern Louisiana and derive revenue from the harvest of timber from the timberlands in
accordance with its harvest plans, and either sells timber to third parties in the domestic market or to the Companys Mills segment for conversion into lumber. In addition, this segment may, from time to time, identify and sell a portion of
its timberland holdings that are either non-strategic to future timberland management activities or that have appreciated, due primarily to location, to a level that exceeds its value as a timber-growing asset. This segment also generates revenue
from oil and gas royalties and the leasing of hunting, oil and gas, and other rights on its timberlands. The Mills segment
consists of Deltics two sawmills which convert timber, either purchased from third parties or the Companys Woodlands segment, into lumber. These mills produce a variety of products, including dimension lumber, boards, and timbers. These
products are sold primarily to wholesale distributors, large retailers, lumber treaters, industrial accounts, and truss manufacturers in the South and Midwest and are used in residential construction, roof trusses, remanufactured products, and
laminated beams. Real Estate operations, which include real estate developments, add value to former legacy timberland by
developing it into upscale, planned residential and commercial developments. These developments, which are generally centered on a core amenity, are being developed in stages. Historically, real estate sales have consisted primarily of residential
lots sold to builders or individuals, commercial site sales, and sales of undeveloped acreage. In addition, this segment currently leases retail and office space to third parties in a retail center constructed by the Company, and held for sale, in
one of its developments. This segment also manages: 1a real estate brokerage subsidiary which generates commission revenue by reselling existing homes and 2a country club operation, Chenal Country Club, Inc., around which the
Companys Chenal Valley development is centered. This club operation derives its revenues from membership services, food and beverage sales, and membership dues. Corporate operations consist primarily of senior management, accounting, information systems, human resources, purchasing, treasury, income tax, and legal staff functions that provide support services to
the operating business units. The Company currently does not allocate the cost of maintaining these support functions to its operating units.

Company as of December31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income/loss, cash flows, and stockholders equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31,
2012. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders Deltic
Timber Corporation: We have audited Deltic Timber Corporations the Company internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2012 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Deltic Timber
Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Deltic Timber Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December31, 2012 and 2011 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income/loss, cash flows, and
stockholders equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2012, and our report dated March8, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. s/ KPMG LLP KPMG LLP Shreveport,
