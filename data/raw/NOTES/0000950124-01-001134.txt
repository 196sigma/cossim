To the Boards of Directors and Shareholders of
DTE Energy Company and
The Detroit Edison Company
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of DTE Energy Company and subsidiaries and of The Detroit Edison
Company and subsidiaries together, the Companies as of December31, 2000 and 1999, and the related
consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and changes in shareholders equity for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2000. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the
Index at Item8. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the
Companies management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedules based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of DTE Energy Company and subsidiaries and of The Detroit Edison Company and
subsidiaries at December31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements of the Companies taken as a whole, present fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Corporate Structure and Principles of Consolidation
DTE Energy Company Company, a Michigan corporation incorporated in 1995, is
an exempt holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act. The
Company has no significant operations of its own, holding instead the stock of
its principal operating subsidiary, The Detroit Edison Company Detroit
Edison, an electric public utility regulated by the Michigan Public Service
Commission MPSCand the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC, and
other energy-related businesses.
All majority-owned subsidiaries are consolidated. Non-majority owned
investments, including investments in limited liability companies, partnerships
and joint ventures, are accounted for using the equity method. All significant
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
In October1999, the Companys investee, Plug Power Inc., completed its initial
public offering IPOof shares of common stock at $15 per share. After the
IPO, the Company owned approximately 32% of Plug Powers outstanding common
stock. As a result of Plug Powers IPO, the Company recognized its
proportionate share of Plug Powers net assets immediately after the IPO and
recorded an increase of $44million in its investment and an after-tax increase
of $28million to retained earnings with no earnings impact in 1999. The
balance of the Plug Power investment at December31, 2000, is approximately $37
million.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
Regulation and Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
Detroit Edisons transmission and distribution business meets the criteria of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFASNo71, Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. This accounting standard recognizes
the cost-based ratemaking process, which results in differences in the
application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and
non-regulated businesses. SFAS No71 requires the recording of regulatory
assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as
revenue and expense in non-regulated businesses. Continued applicability of
SFAS No71 requires that rates be designed to recover specific costs of
providing regulated services and products, and that it be reasonable to assume
that rates are set at
41 levels that will recover a utilitys costs and can be charged to and collected
from customers.
MPSC orders issued in 1997 and 1998 altered the regulatory process in Michigan
and provided a plan for transition to competition for the generation business
of Detroit Edison. Therefore, effective December31, 1998, Detroit Edisons
generation business no longer met the criteria of SFAS No71. See the
following table of regulatory assets and liabilities, and Note 3 for further
details.
June2000 Michigan restructuring legislation provided for securitization, a
mechanism for Detroit Edison to refinance specific assets and costs at lower
interest rates through the issuance of securitization bonds. The MPSC, in an
order issued on January4, 2001, clarifying a November2, 2000 order,
authorized Detroit Edison to securitize up to $1774billion of qualified
costs, including most of the regulatory assets currently recorded. The MPSC
denied Detroit Edisons request to include the residential rate reduction
commencing June5, 2000, until the date of the order and proposed 2000 Electric
Choice implementation costs in the amount securitized. Detroit Edison will
continue to defer the 2000 and future Electric Choice implementation costs $30
million in 2000 and an estimated $25million in 2001 as regulatory assets,
whose recovery will be determined in annual true-ups of stranded cost
proceedings. The MPSC also clarified that recovery of incurred costs, equal to
the impact of the 5% residential rate reduction from the date of the November
order until the securitization bonds are issued approximately $10million in
2000 and approximately $15million for the first quarter of 2001 will occur
before any rate reductions are provided to the commercial and industrial
customers and before the low income energy efficiency fund is initiated.
Securitization bonds are expected to be issued in the first quarter of 2001.

Unamortized loss on reacquired debt
In accordance with MPSC regulations applicable to Detroit Edison, the discount,
premium and expense related to debt redeemed with a refinancing are amortized
over the life of the replacement issue. If related to the generation business,
the unamortized amounts will be securitized. See Note 3. Discount, premium
and expense on early redemptions of debt subsequent to December31, 1998, are
charged to earnings if they relate to the generation business of Detroit Edison
or other non-regulated operations of the Company.
Recoverable income taxes
In 1993, the Company was required to adopt SFAS No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. SFAS No109 requires that deferred income taxes be recorded at the
current income tax rate for all temporary differences between the book and tax
basis of assets and liabilities. Prior to 1993, only those deferred taxes that
were authorized by the MPSC were recorded. On adoption of SFAS No109, the
MPSC authorized the Company to record a regulatory asset providing assurance of
future revenue recovery from customers for all deferred income taxes.
Power supply cost recovery PSCR
As a result of the June2000 Michigan restructuring legislation, the MPSC
determined that adjusting rates for changes in fuel and purchased power
expenses, through continuance of the PSCR clause, would be inconsistent with
the legislation. See Note 3 for further discussion. Beginning in June2000,
actual fuel and purchased power costs are recorded in the period incurred.
Electric Choice implementation costs
Costs incurred to implement the Electric Choice program, which will allow
customers to purchase electricity from a supplier other than Detroit Edison.
Unamortized deferred investment tax credits
Investment tax credits utilized, which relate to utility property, were
deferred and are amortized over the estimated composite service life of the
related property.
Fermi 2 capacity factor performance standard
As a result of the June2000 Michigan restructuring legislation and the
corresponding MPSC orders regarding the PSCR clause, the MPSC mechanism that
provided for the disallowance of net incremental replacement power cost when
Fermi 2 did not perform to certain operating criteria, is no longer in effect. 43 Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Company considers
investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash

Utility properties are stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances
and impairment losses. In general, the cost of properties retired in the
normal course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation. Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and the cost of
new property installed, which replaces property retired, is charged to property
accounts. Detroit Edison recognizes a provision, in current liabilities, for
incremental costs of Fermi 2 refueling outages, including maintenance
activities, anticipated to be incurred during the next scheduled Fermi 2
refueling outage. The annual provision for utility property depreciation is
calculated on the straight-line remaining life method by applying annual rates
approved by the MPSC to the average of year-beginning and year-ending balances
of depreciable property by primary plant accounts. Provision for depreciation
of utility plant, as a percent of average depreciable property, was 338 333% and 332% for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Effective January2001, the transmission assets of Detroit Edison were
transferred to International Transmission Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Detroit Edison. This transfer began the process of establishing the
transmission business as a fully independent company pursuant to FERC orders.
Non-utility property is stated at original cost. Depreciation is computed over
the estimated useful lives using straight-line and declining-balance methods.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment
based on market factors and operational considerations whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable.
Software Costs
The Company capitalizes the cost of software developed for internal use. These
costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over a five-year period beginning
with the projects completion.
Debt Issue Costs
The costs related to the issuance of long-term debt are amortized over the life
of each issue.
45 Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value
method. Compensation expense is not recorded for stock options granted with an
exercise price
equal to the fair market value at the date of grant. For grants of restricted
stock, compensation equal to the market value of the shares at the date of
grant is deferred and amortized to expense over the vesting period. During the
restriction period, recipients of restricted stock grants have the right to be
paid an amount equal to the dividend equivalent of such shares as dividends are
paid. The Company recognizes these amounts as compensation expense.
Accounting for Risk Management Activities
Trading activities of DTE Energy Trading Inc. DTE ET, an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company, are accounted for using the mark-to-market
method of accounting. Under such method, DTE ETs energy trading contracts,
including both transactions for physical delivery and financial instruments,
are recorded at market value. The resulting unrealized gains and losses from
changes in market value of open positions are recorded as other current assets
or liabilities. Current period changes in the trading assets or liabilities
are recognized as net gains or losses in operating revenues. The market prices
used to value these transactions reflect managements best estimate considering
various factors, including closing exchange and over-the-counter quotations,
time value and volatility factors underlying the commitments. Realized gains
and losses from transactions settled with cash are also recognized in operating
revenues. Transactions settled by physical delivery of the underlying
commodity are recorded gross in operating revenues and fuel and purchased power
expense.
Detroit Edison accounts for its forward purchase and sale commitments and
over-the-counter options on a settlement basis.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
The Company adopted SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities, as of January1, 2001. See Note 11 for further
discussion.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the 2000
presentation.
NOTE 2 MERGER AGREEMENT In October1999, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement with
MCN. MCN, a Michigan corporation, is primarily involved in natural gas
production, gathering, processing, transmission, storage and distribution and
energy marketing. MCNs largest subsidiary is Michigan Consolidated Gas
Company, a natural gas utility serving 12million customers in more than 500
communities throughout Michigan. The merger
46 agreement provides that the
Company will acquire all outstanding shares of MCN for $2850 per share in cash
or 0775 shares of Company common stock for each share of MCN common stock,
subject to certain allocation procedures requiring that the aggregate number of
shares of MCN common stock that will be converted into cash and the Companys
common stock will be equal to 55% and 45%, respectively, of the total
number of shares of MCN common stock outstanding immediately prior to the
proposed merger. The transaction was preliminarily valued at $46billion,
which includes the assumption of approximately $2billion of MCNs debt. The
Company expects to continue as an exempt public utility holding company after
the completion of the proposed merger. Shareholders of the Company have
approved the issuance of the necessary shares of common stock to complete the
proposed merger and shareholders of MCN have approved the Agreement and Plan of
Merger.
The proposed merger is being reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission FTC
pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. The FTC staff has focused primarily on
possible competition between the Company and MCN for cogeneration load and
other gas/electric displacement technologies in the companies coincident
retail distribution areas. The Company and MCN are taking action to address
issues raised by the FTC staff, including an agreement for the proposed
transfer to a unit of Exelon Corp. previously Unicom Corp. of a property
interest allowing for the utilization of up to 20billion cubic feet of natural
gas transportation capacity annually on the Michigan Consolidated Gas Company
system in the applicable distribution area. The MPSC approved the agreement in
February2001. The agreement is subject to regulatory approvals and
consummation of the merger. The Company cannot predict the timing or outcome
of the regulatory review process and, therefore, a projected completion date
for the proposed merger cannot be predicted.
NOTE 3 REGULATORY MATTERS Detroit Edison is subject to the primary regulatory jurisdiction of the MPSC,
which, from time to time, issues its orders pertaining to Detroit Edisons
conditions of service, rates and recovery of certain costs including the costs
of generating facilities, regulatory assets and certain other revenue,
accounting and operating-related matters.
Electric Industry Restructuring
There are ongoing proceedings for the restructuring of the Michigan electric
public utility industry and the implementation of Electric Choice.
In a December28, 1998 order, as clarified March8, 1999, the MPSC authorized
the accelerated amortization of the remaining net book balances as of December
31, 1998 of Fermi 2 and its associated regulatory assets in a manner that
provided an opportunity for full recovery under rates from bundled customers
and through transition surcharges from future retail access customers, taking
into account the related tax consequences of those assets, by December31,
2007.
On June3, 2000, Michigan Governor John Engler signed Enrolled Senate Bill No.
937, Public Act 141 of 2000 PA 141, which provides Detroit Edison with the
right to recover
47 stranded costs, codifies and establishes January1, 2002, as
the date for full implementation of the MPSCs existing Electric Choice
program, and requires the MPSC to reduce electric residential rates by 5%.
On that same date, the Governor signed Enrolled Senate Bill No1253, Public
Act 142 of 2000 PA 142. PA 142 provides for the recovery through
securitization of qualified costs, which consist of an electric utilitys
regulatory assets plus various costs associated with, or resulting from, the
establishment of a competitive electric market, and the issuance of
securitization bonds.
In an order issued on November2, 2000, and clarified on January4, 2001, the
MPSC approved the issuance of securitization bonds, which may not exceed 15
years in term, the proceeds of which will be used to recover up to $1774
billion compared to approximately $1850billion requested by Detroit Edison
of qualified costs. The qualified costs approved by the MPSC include Fermi 2
costs, costs of certain other regulatory assets, Electric Choice implementation
costs, the initial and periodic costs of issuance associated with
securitization bonds, and the costs of retiring and refunding securities with
the proceeds of securitization. Detroit Edison will use the proceeds of
securitization bonds to retire debt and equity as required. The issuance of
securitization bonds will result in an overall revenue requirement reduction
for Detroit Edison.
Acting pursuant to PA 141, in an order issued June5, 2000, the MPSC reduced
Detroit Edisons residential electric rates by 5%, or approximately $65million
on an annual basis, and imposed a rate freeze for all classes of customers
through 2003.
The legislation also contains provisions preventing rate increases for
residential customers through 2005, for small business customers through 2004
and remaining business customers through 2003. Certain costs may be deferred
after 2003 and during the period that rate increases are impermissible. This
rate cap may be lifted when certain market test provisions are met, namely, an
electric utility has no more than 30% of generation capacity in its relevant
market, with allowance for capacity needed to meet a utilitys responsibility
to serve its customers. Statewide, multi-utility transmission system
improvements also are required. If these market conditions and transmission
improvements conditions are not met, the rate cap may continue until such
conditions are met or through 2013.
In addition, as a result of the legislation the Company must     
File an application by June5, 2001, to unbundle its commercial and industrial rates.         
Join a FERC-approved Regional Transmission Organization RTOor divest its interest in transmission by December15, 2001.         
Continue to provide service to customers who wish to take service from Detroit Edison.         
Establish a worker transition program for workers that might be displaced. As a result of the legislation discussed above, in several orders issued on
June19, 2000, the MPSC determined that adjusting rates for changes in fuel and
purchased
48 power expenses, through continuance of the PSCR clause, would be
inconsistent with the new statutes. Detroit Edison was not permitted to collect
the 1998 PSCR underrecovery of $86million, plus accrued interest of $30
million. Detroit Edison reversed approximately $55million of liabilities
associated with the PSCR clause as of
the effective date of the legislation. Parties have filed Claims of Appeal
regarding the PSCR issues with the Michigan Court of Appeals. The Company is
not able to determine the timing or outcome of these proceedings.
Detroit Edison is unable to predict the outcome of the matters discussed
herein. Resolution of these matters is dependent upon future MPSC orders which
may impact the financial position of Detroit Edison.
Accounting Implications
Due to 1997 and 1998 restructuring orders which provided sufficient details
regarding the transition to competition for its electric generation business,
at December31, 1998, Detroit Edison performed an impairment test of its Fermi
2 nuclear generation plant and related regulatory assets. The impairment test
for Fermi 2 indicated that it was fully impaired. Therefore, the Fermi 2 plant
asset and its related regulatory assets were written off. At December31,
1998, the accumulation of future regulatory recovery for Fermi 2 assets from
bundled customers and transition surcharges from future retail access customers
was calculated. Since the December28, 1998 MPSC order provided for full
recovery of Fermi 2 through the regulated transmission and distribution
business, a regulatory asset was established which was planned to be amortized
through December31, 2007. There was no impact on income from the write-off of
the Fermi 2 plant assets and subsequent recording of the regulatory asset for
unamortized nuclear costs. The regulatory asset is included in the amounts
planned to be securitized as provided for in the 2000 Michigan restructuring
legislation and MPSC orders.
Other
In accordance with a November1997 MPSC order, Detroit Edison reduced revenues
by $53million to reflect the scheduled reduction in the revenue requirement
for Fermi 2, in accordance with the 1988 settlement agreement. The $53million
decrease is included in the $94million decrease effective January1, 1999. In
addition, the November1997 MPSC order authorized the deferral of $30million
of 1997 storm damage costs and amortization and recovery of the costs over a
24-month period commencing January1998. In December1997, ABATE and the
Residential Ratepayer Consortium filed a lawsuit in Ingham County Circuit Court
contending that Detroit Edison and the MPSC breached the December1988 MPSC
order, but the lawsuit was subsequently dismissed. The Michigan Attorney
General has filed an appeal of the November1997 order in the Michigan Court of
Appeals. In June1999, in an unpublished opinion, the Michigan Court of
Appeals remanded back to the MPSC for hearing the November1997 order. Detroit
Edison filed a motion for rehearing with the Michigan Court of Appeals in July
1999, but the motion was subsequently dismissed. In December2000, the MPSC
issued an order reopening the case for hearing. Detroit Edison is unable to
determine the timing or the outcome of the remand.
49 NOTE 4 FERMI 2 General
Fermi 2, a nuclear generating unit, began commercial operation in January1988.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRCmaintains jurisdiction over the
licensing and operation of Fermi 2. Fermi 2 has a design electrical rating
netof 1,150 megawatts MW. This unit represents approximately 11% of total
operation and maintenance expenses and 10% of summer net rated capability of
Detroit Edison. The net book balance of the Fermi 2 plant was written off at
December31, 1998, and an equivalent regulatory asset was established. See
Note 3.
Ownership of an operating nuclear generating unit subjects Detroit Edison to
significant additional risks. Fermi 2 is regulated by a number of different
governmental agencies concerned with public health, safety and environmental
protection. Consequently, Fermi 2 is subjected to greater scrutiny than a
conventional fossil-fuel plant.
Insurance
Detroit Edison insures Fermi 2 with property damage insurance provided by
Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited NEIL. The NEIL insurance policies provide
$500million of composite primary coverage with a $1million deductible and
$225billion of excess coverage, respectively, for stabilization,
decontamination and debris removal costs, repair and/or replacement of property
and decommissioning. The combined limits provide total property damage
insurance of $275billion.
Detroit Edison maintains insurance policies with NEIL providing for extra
expenses, including certain replacement power costs necessitated by Fermi 2s
unavailability due to an insured event. These policies have a 12-week waiting
period and provide for three years of coverage.
Under the NEIL policies, Detroit Edison could be liable for maximum
retrospective assessments of up to approximately $15million per loss if any
one loss should exceed the accumulated funds available to NEIL.
As required by federal law, Detroit Edison maintains $200million of public
liability insurance for a nuclear incident. Further, under the Price-Anderson
Amendments Act of 1988 Act, deferred premium charges of $84million could be
levied against each licensed nuclear facility, but not more than $10million
per year per facility. On December31, 2000, there were 106 licensed nuclear
facilities in the United States. Thus, deferred premium charges in the
aggregate amount of approximately $889billion could be levied against all
owners of licensed nuclear facilities in the event of a nuclear incident at any
of these facilities. The Act will expire on August1, 2002. It is unknown
whether this statute will be renewed or modified.
50 Decommissioning
The NRC has jurisdiction over the decommissioning of nuclear power plants and
requires decommissioning funding based upon a formula. The MPSC and FERC
regulate the recovery of costs of decommissioning nuclear power plants and both
require the use of
external trust funds to finance the decommissioning of Fermi 2. Rates approved
by the MPSC provide for the decommissioning costs of Fermi 2. Detroit Edison
is continuing to fund FERC jurisdictional amounts for decommissioning even
though explicit provisions are not included in FERC rates. Detroit Edison
believes that the MPSC and FERC collections will be adequate to fund the
estimated cost of decommissioning using the NRC formula.
Detroit Edison has established external trust funds to hold decommissioning and
low-level radioactive waste disposal funds collected from customers. During
2000, 1999 and 1998, Detroit Edison collected $38million, $38million and $36
million, respectively, from customers for decommissioning and low-level
radioactive waste disposal. Such amounts were recorded as components of
depreciation and amortization expense and in other liabilities. A net
unrealized loss of $18million and a net unrealized gain of $4million in 2000
and 1999, respectively, were recorded as adjustments to the nuclear
decommissioning trust funds and other liabilities. Investments in debt and
equity securities held within the external trust funds are classified as
available for sale.
At December31, 2000, Detroit Edison had a reserve of $351million for the
future decommissioning of Fermi 2, $15million for low-level radioactive waste
disposal costs, and $32million for the decommissioning of Fermi 1, an
experimental nuclear unit on the Fermi 2 site that has been shut down since
1972. These reserves are included in other liabilities, with a like amount
deposited in external trust funds. It is estimated that the cost of
decommissioning Fermi 2, when its license expires in the year 2025, will be
$912million in 2000 dollars and $37billion in 2025 dollars using a 6%
inflation rate. The cost of decommissioning Fermi 1 is approximately $30-35
million. During 2000, Detroit Edison decided to proceed with the
decommissioning of Fermi 1, with the goal of removing the radioactive material
and terminating the Fermi 1 license. The full project is expected to take
about five years.
Fermi 2 Phase-In Plan
Based on a MPSC-authorized phase-in plan, Detroit Edison recorded a receivable
totaling $507million from 1988 through 1992. Beginning in 1993 and ending in
1998, these amounts were amortized to operating expense as they were included
in rates. Amortization of these amounts totaled $84million in 1998.
Capacity Factor Performance Standard
At December31, 1999, Detroit Edison had an accrual of $63million for the
Fermi 2 capacity factor performance standard disallowances that were expected
to be imposed
51 by the MPSC. As a result of the June2000 Michigan restructuring
legislation, this liability was reversed.
Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs
In accordance with the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, Detroit Edison
has a contract with the U.S. Department of Energy DOEfor the future storage
and disposal of spent nuclear fuel from Fermi 2. Detroit Edison is obligated
to pay DOE a fee of one mill
per net kilowatthour of Fermi 2 electricity generated and sold. The fee is a
component of nuclear fuel expense. Delays have occurred in the DOEs program
for the acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel at a permanent
repository. Until the DOE is able to fulfill its obligation under the
contract, Detroit Edison is responsible for the spent nuclear fuel storage and
estimates that existing storage capacity will be sufficient until 2007, after
the expansion of such storage capacity in 2001.

NOTE 7 SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY At December31, 2000, the Company had 5million shares of Cumulative Preferred
Stock, without par value, authorized with no shares issued. At December31,
2000, 15million shares of preferred stock are reserved for issuance in
accordance with the
Shareholders Rights Agreement.
At December31, 2000, Detroit Edison had 30million shares of Cumulative
Preference Stock of $1 par value and 675million shares of Cumulative
Preferred Stock of $100 par value authorized, with no shares issued.
In September1997, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend
distribution of one right Right for each share of Company common stock
outstanding. Under certain circumstances, each Right entitles the shareholder
to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Company SeriesA Junior
Participating Preferred Stock at a price of $90. If the acquiring person or
group acquires 10% or more of the Company common stock, and the Company
survives, each Right other than those held by the acquirer will entitle its
holder to buy Company common stock having a value of $180 for $90. If the
acquiring person or group acquires 10% or more of the Company common stock, and
the Company does not survive, each Right other than those held by the
surviving or acquiring company will entitle its holder to buy shares of common
stock of the surviving
54 or acquiring company having a value of $180 for $90. The Rights will expire on
October6, 2007, unless redeemed by the Company at $001 per Right at any time
prior to an event that would permit the Rights to be exercised. The Company
may amend the Rights agreement without the approval of the holders of the
Rights Certificates, except that the redemption price may not be less than
$001 per Right.
During the year ended December31, 2000, the Company repurchased approximately
23million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $70million, under a
program that began in February2000.

Detroit Edisons 1924 Mortgage and Deed of Trust Mortgage, the lien of which
covers a substantial portion of Detroit Edisons properties, provides for the
issuance of additional General and Refunding Mortgage Bonds Mortgage Bonds.
At December31, 2000, approximately $42billion principal amount of Mortgage
Bonds could have been issued on the basis of property additions, combined with
an earnings test provision, assuming an interest rate of 7% on any such
additional Mortgage Bonds. An additional $21billion principal amount of
Mortgage Bonds could have been issued on the basis of bond retirements.
Unless an event of default has occurred, and is continuing, each series of
Quarterly Income Debt Securities QUIDSprovides that interest will be paid
quarterly. However,
56 Detroit Edison also has the right to extend the interest payment period on the
QUIDS for up to 20 consecutive interest payment periods. Interest would
continue to accrue during the deferral period. If this right is exercised,
Detroit Edison may not declare or pay dividends on, or redeem, purchase or
acquire, any of its capital stock during the deferral period. Detroit Edison
may redeem any series of capital stock pursuant to the terms of any sinking
fund provisions during the deferral period. Additionally, during any deferral
period, Detroit Edison may not enter into any inter-company transactions with
any affiliate of Detroit Edison, including the Company, to enable the payment
of dividends on any equity securities of the Company.
At December31, 2000, $273million of notes and bonds were subject to periodic
remarketings within one year. Remarketing agents remarket these securities at
the lowest interest rate necessary to produce a par bid. In the event that a
remarketing fails, Standby Note Purchase Agreements and/or Letters of Credit
provide that banks will purchase the securities and, after the conclusion of
all necessary proceedings, remarket the bonds. In the event the banks
obligations under the Standby Note Purchase Agreements and/or Letters of
Credit are not honored, then Detroit Edison would be required to purchase any
securities subject to a failed remarketing.
At December31, 2000, the Company had letters of credit from a bank that
allowed the Company to use approximately $45million of cash previously
classified as restricted on the Companys balance sheet. There were no
amounts drawn on these letters of credit at December31, 2000.
NOTE 9 SHORT-TERM CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS AND BORROWINGS At December31, 2000, Detroit Edison had total short-term credit arrangements
of approximately $517million, under which $245million was outstanding. At
December31, 1999, $162million was outstanding. The weighted average interest
rates for short-term borrowings at December31, 2000 and 1999 were 66% and
69%, respectively.
Detroit Edisons short-term credit arrangements included bank lines of credit
of $201million, all of which had commitment fees in lieu of compensating
balances. Detroit Edison uses bank lines of credit and other credit facilities
to support the issuance of commercial paper and bank loans. Detroit Edison had
$45million and $162million of commercial paper outstanding at December31,
2000 and 1999, respectively.
Detroit Edisons short-term credit arrangements also included a $200million
short-term financing agreement secured by its customer accounts receivable and
unbilled revenues portfolio under which $200million was outstanding at
December31, 2000 and 1999, with a weighted average interest rate of 676% and
542%, respectively.
Detroit Edison has a nuclear fuel financing arrangement with Renaissance Energy
Company Renaissance, an unaffiliated company. Renaissance may issue
commercial paper or borrow from participating banks on the basis of promissory
notes. To the extent the maximum amount of funds available to Renaissance
currently $400million is not needed by Renaissance to purchase nuclear fuel,
such funds may be loaned to Detroit Edison for general corporate purposes
pursuant to a separate Loan Agreement. At
57 December31, 2000, approximately $316million was available to Detroit Edison
under such Loan Agreement.
At December31, 2000 and 1999, DTE Capital Corporation DTE Capital, a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company, had $258million and $25million of commercial
paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 769% and 680 respectively. A $400million short-term credit arrangement, backed by a
Support Agreement from the Company, provided credit support for this commercial
paper.
During the first quarter of 2000, plans were announced to terminate DTE
Capitals operations. Subsequently, the Company assumed all of DTE Capitals
outstanding guarantees. The Company is authorized to issue up to $550million
of guarantees. At December31, 2000, the Company had assumed and/or issued
guarantees of various consolidated affiliate obligations of approximately $238
million.
NOTE 10 LEASES Future minimum lease payments under capital leases, consisting of nuclear fuel
$85million computed on a projected units of production basis, lake vessels

Detroit Edison has a contract with Renaissance which provides for the purchase
by Renaissance for Detroit Edison of up to $400million of nuclear fuel,
subject to the continued availability of funds to Renaissance to purchase such
fuel. Title to the nuclear fuel is held by Renaissance. Detroit Edison makes
quarterly payments under the contract based on the consumption of nuclear fuel
for the generation of electricity.
58 NOTE 11 FINANCIAL AND OTHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Trading Activities
DTE ET markets and trades electricity and natural gas physical products and
financial instruments, and provides risk management services utilizing energy
commodity derivative instruments, which include futures, exchange traded and
over-the-counter options, and forward purchase and sale commitments.
Notional Amounts and Terms
The notional amounts and terms of DTE ETs outstanding energy trading financial
instruments at December31, 2000 were

At December31, 2000, DTE ET also had sales and purchase commitments for
physical delivery of electricity associated with contracts based on fixed
prices totaling 810,578 net MWh purchased with terms extending up to 2years.
Notional amounts reflect the volume of transactions, but do not necessarily
represent the amounts exchanged by the parties to the energy commodity
derivative instruments. Accordingly, notional amounts do not accurately
measure DTE ETs exposure to market or credit risks. The maximum terms in
years detailed above are not indicative of likely future cash flows as these
positions may be offset in the markets at any time in response to DTE ETs risk
management needs.
Fair Values
The average fair values of DTE ETs derivative financial assets and liabilities
during 2000 were $1094million and $951million, respectively, and during
1999 $287million and $243million, respectively. At December31, 2000 and
1999, the fair values of the derivative financial assets and liabilities were
$2889million and $2799million and, $666million and $496million,
respectively. Net unrealized gains were $90million and $170million at
December31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Market Risk
DTE ET manages, on a portfolio basis, the market risks inherent in its
activities subject to parameters established by the Companys Risk Management
Committee RMC, which is authorized by its Board of Directors. Market risks
are monitored by the RMC to ensure compliance with the Companys stated risk
management policies. DTE ET marks its portfolio to market and measures its
risk on a daily basis in accordance with
59 Value at Risk VaR and other risk methodologies. The quantification of market
risk using VaR provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy
markets and products.
Credit Risk
DTE ET is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by customers or
counterparties of its contractual obligations. The concentration of customers
and/or counterparties may impact overall exposure to credit risk, either
positively or negatively, in that the counterparties may be similarly affected
by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions. However, DTE ET
maintains credit policies with regard to its customers and counterparties that
management believes significantly minimize overall credit risk. These policies
include an evaluation of potential customers and counterparties financial
condition and credit rating, collateral requirements or other credit
enhancements such as letters of credit or guarantees, and the use of
standardized agreements which allow for the netting or offsetting of positive
and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. Based on these
policies, the Company does not anticipate a materially adverse effect on
financial position or results of operations as a result of customer or
counterparty nonperformance. Those futures and option contracts which are
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange are financially guaranteed by the
Exchange and have nominal credit risk.
Non-Trading Activities
The Company has entered into a series of forward-starting interest rate swaps
and Treasury locks in order to limit its sensitivity to interest rate
fluctuations associated with its anticipated issuance of long-term debt to be
used to finance the proposed merger with MCN. The Company has designated these
instruments as hedges. The Company expects to issue this debt subsequent to
the proposed merger. The forward-starting swaps, which include notional
amounts of $250million and $450million in five- and 10-year maturities,
respectively, have a weighted average interest rate of 755% and 761 respectively. The Treasury locks, which include notional amounts of $50million
and $150million in 10- and 30-year maturities, respectively, have a weighted
average interest rate of 601% and 626%, respectively. At December31, 2000,
the fair value of these derivative financial instruments indicated an
unrealized loss of approximately $84million. The unrealized loss is not
reflected in the financial statements at December31, 2000, but would be
recognized as a deferred item upon issuance of the anticipated long-term debt.
The deferred item would be amortized through interest expense over the life of
the associated long-term debt as a yield adjustment.
PCI Enterprises Company PCI, a wholly owned coal pulverizing subsidiary,
entered into a seven-year interest rate swap agreement beginning June30, 1997,
with the intent of reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on a
portion of its variable rate non-recourse debt. The initial notional amount
was $30million. The notional amount outstanding at December31, 2000 and
1999, was $22million and $24million, respectively, and will decline
throughout the term of the loan based on amortization of principal amounts.
PCI pays a fixed interest rate of 696% on the notional amount and receives a
variable interest rate based on LIBOR. In 2000 and 1999, the average rate
60 received was 648% and 528%, respectively. The net of interest received and
interest paid on the swap is accrued as a component of interest expense in the
current period.
New Accounting Pronouncement
In June1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASBissued SFAS No.
133. SFAS No133, as amended, requires every derivative instrument to be
recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or a liability measured at its fair
value, and that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently
in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
SFAS No133 requires that as of the date of initial adoption, the difference
between the fair market value of derivative instruments recorded on the balance
sheet and the previous carrying amount of those derivatives be reported in net
income or other comprehensive income, as appropriate, as the cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle in accordance with Accounting Principles
Board Opinion 20, Accounting Changes.
As of January1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No133, as required. The
cumulative effect of the adoption of SFAS No133 is expected to be an
after-tax increase in net income of approximately $36million, and an
after-tax decrease in other comprehensive income of approximately $415
million. The adoption will also impact assets and liabilities recorded on the
balance sheet. At January1, 2001, the Company had the following types of
derivative instruments: forward-starting swaps, Treasury locks, wholesale power
contracts and an interest rate swap.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of financial instruments is determined by reference to various
market data and other valuation techniques as appropriate. The carrying amount
of financial instruments, except for long-term debt and other instruments
disclosed herein, approximates fair value. The estimated fair value of total
long-term debt at December31, 2000 and 1999 was $42billion and $4billion,
respectively, compared to the carrying amount of $41billion and $42billion,
respectively.
NOTE 12 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments
Detroit Edison has outstanding purchase commitments of approximately $1,048
million at December31, 2000, which includes, among other things, line
construction and clearance costs and equipment purchases. The Company and
Detroit Edison have also entered into long-term fuel supply commitments of
approximately $1,005million.
Detroit Edison has an Energy Purchase Agreement Agreement for the purchase of
steam and electricity from the Detroit Resource Recovery Facility. Under the
Agreement, Detroit Edison will purchase steam through 2008 and electricity
through June2024. In 1996, a special charge to net income of $149million
$97million after-tax or $067 per
61 share was recorded. The special charge included a reserve for steam purchase
commitments from 1997 through 2008 and expenditures for closure of a portion of
the steam heating system. The reserve for steam purchase commitments was
recorded at its present value; therefore Detroit Edison is recording non-cash
accretion expense through 2008. In addition, amortization of the reserve for
steam purchase commitments is netted against losses on steam heating purchases
recorded in fuel and purchased power expense. Purchases of steam and
electricity were approximately $35million, $35million and $31million for
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Annual steam purchase commitments are
approximately $38million, $39million, $40million, $42million and $43
million for 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively.
In October1995, the MPSC issued an order approving Detroit Edisons six-year
capacity and energy purchase agreement with Ontario Hydro. Ontario Hydro
agreed to sell Detroit Edison 300 MW of capacity from mid-May through
mid-September. This purchase offsets a concurrent agreement to lease
approximately one-third of Detroit Edisons Ludington 917 MW capacity to
FirstEnergy for the same time period. The net economic effect of the Ludington
lease and the Ontario Hydro purchase is an estimated reduction in expense of
$74million over the term of the agreement.
The EPA has issued ozone transport regulations and final new air quality
standards relating to ozone and particulate air pollution. In September1998,
the EPA issued a State Implementation Plan SIPcall, giving states a year to
develop new regulations to limit nitrogen oxide emissions because of their
contribution to ozone formation. Detroit Edison has spent approximately $50
million and estimates that it will incur approximately $410million of future
capital expenditures over the next three years to comply. In March2000, the
U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit ruled in favor of the EPAs SIP call
regulations. The new air quality standards have been upheld in legal
challenges in the U.S. Court of Appeals, but the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed
to hear the appeal. Until the legal issues are resolved, it is impossible to
predict the full impact of the new air quality standards. Under the June2000
Michigan restructuring legislation, beginning January1, 2004, annual return of
and on this capital expenditure, in excess of current depreciation levels,
would be deferred, in ratemaking, until after the expiration of the rate cap
period, presently expected to end December31, 2005.
Contingencies
The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, including environmental
matters, of a nature considered normal to its business. The Company believes
that such litigation and the matters discussed above will not have a material
effect on its financial position and results of operations.
See Notes 3 and 4 for a discussion of contingencies related to Regulatory
Matters and Fermi 2. 62 NOTE 13 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Retirement Plan
Detroit Edison has a trusteed and non-contributory defined benefit retirement
plan covering all eligible employees who have completed six months of service.
The plan provides retirement benefits based on the employees years of benefit
service, average final compensation and age at retirement. Detroit Edisons
policy is to fund pension cost calculated under the projected unit credit
actuarial cost method.

There are several additional supplemental non-qualified, non-contributory,
retirement benefit plans for certain management employees.
Savings and Investment Plans
Detroit Edison has voluntary defined contribution plans qualified under Section
401 aand kof the Internal Revenue Code for all eligible employees.
Detroit Edison contributes up to 6% of base compensation for non-represented
employees and up to 4% for represented employees. Matching contributions were
$22million, $21million and $21million for 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
Other Postretirement Benefits
Detroit Edison provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance
benefits for retired employees. Substantially all of Detroit Edisons
employees will become eligible for such benefits if they reach retirement age
while working for Detroit Edison. These benefits are provided principally
through insurance companies and other organizations.

Benefit costs were calculated assuming health care cost trend rates beginning
at 92% for 2001 and decreasing to 5% in 2008 and thereafter for persons under
age 65 and decreasing from 98% to 5% for persons age 65 and over. A
one-percentage-point increase in health care cost trend rates would have
increased the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of
benefit costs by $126million and would have increased the accumulated benefit
obligation by $964million at December31, 2000. A one-percentage-point
decrease in the health care cost trend rates would have decreased the aggregate
of the service cost and interest cost components of benefit costs by $101
million and would have decreased the accumulated benefit obligation by $789
million at December31, 2000.
66 NOTE 14 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company adopted a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIPin 1995. Under the LTIP,
certain key employees may be granted restricted common stock, stock options,
stock appreciation rights, performance shares and performance units. Common
stock granted under the LTIP may not exceed 72million shares. Performance
units which have a face amount of $1 granted under the LTIP may not exceed 25
million in the aggregate. As of December31, 2000, no stock appreciation
rights or performance units have been granted under the LTIP.
Under the LTIP, shares of restricted common stock were awarded and are
restricted for a period not exceeding four years. All shares are subject to
forfeiture if specified performance measures are not met. During the
applicable restriction period, the recipient has all the voting, dividend and
other rights of a record holder except that the shares are nontransferable, and
non-cash distributions paid upon the shares would be subject to transfer
restrictions and risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the shares
themselves. The shares were recorded at the market value on the date of grant
and amortized to expense based on the award that was expected to vest and the
period during which the related employee services were to be rendered.

67 Effective February22, 2000, under the LTIP, the Companys Special Committee on
Compensation the Committee granted performance share awards. The
performance share award includes a target award established by the Committee
that when paid, can equal a multiple from zero to two times the recipients
target award, based on the Companys performance as compared against the goals
established by the Committee on February22, 2000, for the four fiscal year
cycle that began on January1, 2000. The four performance goals established by
the Committee with respect to this grant are based on: 1 the Companys
four-year total shareholder return compared to the Dow Jones Electric Utility
Industry Group; 2 the Companys four-year earnings per share growth; 3 the
Companys four-year employee satisfaction goal; and 4 the Companys four-year
Institute of Nuclear Power Operations goal. During the applicable restriction
period, the recipient of a performance share award has no rights as a
shareholder until and to the extent that the performance share award is earned
and common stock is actually distributed to the recipient. However, recipients
will be paid an amount equal to the dividend equivalent on such shares as
dividends are paid. Performance share awards are nontransferable and are
subject to risk of forfeiture. As of December31, 2000, there were 125,750
performance share awards outstanding.
Stock options were also issued under the LTIP. Usually options are exercisable
at a rate of 25% per year during the four years following the date of grant.
However in 2000, more than 97% of the 2,018,400 options granted vest 50%, 20 20% and 10% over a four-year period. The options will expire 10years after
the date of the grant. The option exercise price equals the fair market value
of the stock on the date that the option was granted. Stock option activity

The Company applies APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recorded for options granted.
As required by SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the
Company has determined the pro forma information as if it had accounted for its
employee stock
options under the fair value method. The fair value for these options was

1999 and 1998, respectively, and to reduce earnings per share by $002 and
$001 for the years ended December31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. There was
no pro forma effect on earnings per share for the year ended December31, 1998.

NOTE 17 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS UNAUDITED
As discussed in Note 2, in October 1999, the Company entered into
a definitive merger agreement with MCN. On February 28, 2001, the
Company and MCN announced a revised merger agreement that provides
that the Company will acquire all outstanding shares of MCN for
$2400 per share in cash or 0715 shares of Company common stock for
each share of MCN common stock. As provided for in the original
agreement, certain allocation and proration procedures will be used
to ensure that the aggregate number of shares of MCN common stock
that will be converted into cash and the Companys common stock will
be equal to 55% and 45%, respectively, of the total number of shares
of MCN common stock outstanding immediately prior to the proposed
merger. The value of the revised transaction is approximately $427
billion, including the assumption of approximately $2 billion of
MCNs debt.
The revised agreement extends the expiration date of the agreement
from April 15, 2001 to December 31, 2001 to allow sufficient time to
obtain the necessary approvals as well as MCN shareholder approval of
the revised agreement. The boards of directors of DTE and MCN have
approved the revised merger agreement. DTE and MCN now estimate that
all required approvals can be obtained and the merger can be
completed within four to five months.
