30        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To The Ultimate Software Group, Inc.     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The
Ultimate Software Group, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiary as of
December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity deficit and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Ultimate
Software Group, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1999 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. s/ Arthur Andersen LLP

35        THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS
The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. the Company designs, markets,
implements and supports technologically advanced, cross-industry human resource
management and payroll software solutions, marketed primarily to middle-market
organizations with 500 to 15,000 employees. The Company reaches its customer
base and target market through its direct sales force and a network of national,
regional and local strategic partners.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.
In February and March 1998, the Company acquired the businesses of five
third-party resellers of the Company products the Acquired Resellers in
exchange for an aggregate of 121,856 shares of the Company Class B Common
Stock, converted into 1,233,061 shares of the Company common stock, par value
$01 per share the Common Stock in connection with the initial public
offering discussed in Note 3. The Company accounted for these transactions
using the poolings-of-interest method of accounting. Therefore the accounts of
the Acquired Resellers have been included retroactively in the consolidated
financial statements as if the companies had operated as one entity since
inception. See Note 15.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months
or less when acquired are considered cash equivalents. The accompanying
consolidated balance sheets include $80 million and $166 million in
interest-bearing accounts as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are principally from end-users of the Company
products. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers and
has recorded allowances for estimated losses.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment is depreciated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which range
from three to five years. Leasehold improvements and assets under capital leases
are amortized over the shorter of the life of the asset or the term of the lease
over periods ranging from three to fifteen years. Maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense when incurred; betterments are capitalized. Upon the sale or
retirement of assets, the cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization are
removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized.
Revenue Recognition
The Company licenses software under noncancellable license agreements
and provides services including maintenance, implementation, training and
consulting services. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, license revenues are generally
36 recognized when a noncancellable license agreement has been signed, the product
has been shipped, no significant vendor obligations remain and collection of the
related receivable is considered probable. Revenues from maintenance agreements
for maintaining, supporting and providing periodic updates are recognized
ratably over the maintenance period, which in most instances is one year.
Revenues for training and consulting services are recognized as services are
performed.
The Company also generates revenues relating to the sale of
payroll-related forms and the printing of Form W-2 for certain customers. Such
revenues are recognized as the product is shipped or as the services are
rendered.
Until 1997, substantially all of the Company revenues were derived
from its UltiPro for Lan product and related services. The Company has shifted
its focus from a product based on DOS and local area network Lan technologies,
UltiPro for Lan, to a product based on Windows and client/ server technologies,
UltiPro HRMS/Payroll. As a result of this shift and the decrease in general
market demand for DOS-based products, the Company revenues from its UltiPro
for Lan product declined to an immaterial amount in 1998. While the Company
still derives revenues from the support, service and limited sales of the
UltiPro for Lan product line, its UltiPro HRMS/Payroll product and related
support and services are expected to continue to account for substantially all
of the Company revenues for the foreseeable future as the Company no longer
actively markets the DOS-based product. As a percentage of total license
revenues, revenues derived from UltiPro for Lan were 03%, 16%, and 414% in
1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively.
Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue is primarily comprised of deferrals for i service
revenues for which maintenance services have not yet been rendered; and, to a
lesser degree ii license revenues for which product has not yet been delivered
or obligations have not yet been fulfilled in the case of committed upgrades.
As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, $564,000 and $221,000, respectively,
of deferred revenue will be recognized in periods after the years ending
December 31, 2000 and 1999.
Associated deferred costs, relating to commissions, were $768,000 and
$619,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Commission expense is
recognized in the period the related revenue is recognized.
Cost of Revenues
The cost of revenues consists of cost of license revenues and cost of
service revenues. Cost of license revenues primarily consists of fees payable to
a third party for software products distributed by the Company and, to a lesser
degree, amortization of capitalized software. Cost of service revenues primarily
consists of costs to provide consulting, implementation, maintenance, technical
support and training to the Company customers, the cost of providing periodic
updates and costs related to sales of payroll-related forms.
Income Taxes
The Company is subject to corporate Federal and state income taxes and
accounts for income taxes under the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS
109. SFAS 109 provides for a liability approach under which deferred income
taxes are provided based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the
periods in which the taxes become payable.
Acquired Intangibles
Acquired intangibles were amortized on a straight-line basis over 30
months, the estimated useful life of such acquired assets primarily consisting
of customer lists and personnel and were fully amortized as of December 31,
1998. In accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment Of
Long-Lived Assets
37 and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, the Company continually evaluated
whether later events and circumstances occurred that would indicate the
remaining acquired intangibles warranted revision or may not have been
recoverable. When factors indicated that goodwill should be evaluated for
possible impairment, the Company used an estimate of the related business'
undiscounted cash flows from operations over the remaining life of the cost in
excess of net assets of acquired businesses, in measuring whether such cost was
recoverable. Operating results as well as projected future cash flows relating
to the resellers acquired during 1996 indicated an impairment in acquired
intangibles as of December 31, 1997 and 1996. Accordingly, the Company charged
additional amounts of $308,000 and $5,050,000 to amortization of acquired
intangibles in 1997 and 1996, respectively, to reduce acquired intangibles to
their estimated realizable value. Amortization of acquired intangibles was zero 638,000, and $1,442,000 in 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively.
Software Development Costs
SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold,
Leased or Otherwise Marketed, requires capitalization of certain software
development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility.
Based on the Company product development process, technological feasibility is
established upon completion of a working model. As of December 31, 1999 and
1998, capitalized software costs totaled $836,000 and $53,000, respectively.
Amortization of capitalized software was $68,000, $8,000 and zero in 1999, 1998
and 1997, respectively.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company financial instruments, consisting of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and borrowings approximate
fair value due to their short-term nature.
Accounting for Stock-based Compensation
As permitted by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS 123, the Company continues to account for stock-based compensation
using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and has made the pro
forma disclosures required by SFAS 123 for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1999. See Note 9.
Earnings Per Share
SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, became effective in the fourth
quarter of 1997 and requires dual presentation of earnings per share--basic
and diluted. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available
to common stockholders the numerator by the weighted average number of common
shares the denominator for the period. The computation of diluted earnings per
share is similar to basic earnings per share, except that the denominator is
increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been
outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued.
38     The following is a reconciliation of the shares used in the computation
of basic and diluted net income loss per share in thousands                         FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,
1999    1998    1997

Basic and diluted loss per share for all periods presented include the
impact of the subsequent conversion of shares of Preferred and Common Stock
outstanding as described in Notes 10 and 17, effected for the stock split
discussed in Note 3. Other common stock equivalents not included in the
computation of diluted net income loss per share as their impact is
antidilutive totaled 1,380,000, 2,105,000 and 1,749,000 for 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.
Comprehensive Income
In 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, SFAS 130 which establishes standards for the reporting and display
of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of financial
statements. The objective of SFAS 130 is to report a measure comprehensive
income of all changes in equity of an enterprise that result from transactions
and other economic events in a period other than transactions with owners. The
adoption of SFAS 130 did not have a material impact on the Company
consolidated financial statements since there are no material differences
between comprehensive income, as defined in SFAS 130, and the Company net
income loss for all periods presented.
Segment Information
The Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, SFAS 131 effective December 31, 1998.
SFAS 131 establishes standards for the way that public companies report selected
information about operating segments in annual interim financial reports to
shareholders. It also establishes standards for related disclosures about an
enterprise business segments, products, services, geographic areas and major
customers. The Company operates its business as a single segment. As a result,
no additional disclosure was required.
Recent Accounting Statements
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, SFAS 133 and SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities--Deferral of the effective date of FASB No.
133 SFAS 137 were issued in June 1998 and June 1999, respectively, and are
effective for the Company fiscal year ending December 31, 2001. These
pronouncements establish accounting and reporting standards requiring that every
derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a
liability measured at its fair value. The Company believes that the adoption of
SFAS 133 and SFAS 137 will not have a material impact on its financial
statements as it has not entered into derivative contracts or hedging activities
and has no current plans to do so in the foreseeable future.
In March 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ACSEC issued SOP 98-1,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use SOP 98-1. SOP 98-1 establishes criteria for determining which
costs of developing or obtaining internal-use computer software should be
charged to expense and which should be capitalized. The Company adopted SOP 98-1
effective January 1, 1999. The Company adoption of SOP 98-1 did not have a
material effect on the Company financial position or results of operations.
39 Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the notes to consolidated financial statements have
been reclassified to conform to the 1999 classification.
3. INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
On June 5, 1998, the Company completed the sale of 3,250,000 shares of
the Company common stock, par value $01 the Common Stock, in an initial
public offering at an offering price of $10 per share the IPO. Prior to the
closing of the IPO, the Company Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock, Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and
Class C Common Stock were converted into Common Stock. In connection with the
IPO, the Company effected a 10119-for-1 stock split of the issued and
outstanding shares of the Common Stock. All references to Common Stock amounts,
shares and per share data have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to the
stock split.

and 1997, respectively.
6. CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS
The Company leases certain equipment under noncancellable agreements
which are accounted for as capital leases and expire at various dates through
2002. Interest rates on these leases range from 48% to 63%. The annual
maturities of the capital lease obligations are as follows as of December 31,

7. LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS
In September 1996, the Company entered into a line of credit with a
bank the Working Capital Line for the lesser of $4,000,000 or 80% of
eligible receivables, as defined. The Working Capital Line was increased to the
lesser of 80% of the eligible receivables as defined or $60 million for the
period beginning April 23, 1998 and ending September 30, 1998. The Working
Capital Line was further amended, from time to time, to extend the agreement to
December 31, 2000 with available borrowings equivalent to the lesser of
$4,000,000 or 80% of eligible receivables, as defined. The Working Capital Line
bears interest at LIBOR plus 4875% per annum 11011% and 9885% at December
31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, but not less than 8000% per annum in any
month. Interest on the Working Capital Line is payable monthly. No amounts were
outstanding under the Working Capital Line as of December 31, 1999 and 1998. The
Working Capital Line is renewable for successive one-year terms, unless either
party elects to terminate the agreement. The Working Capital Line is
collateralized by substantially all of the Company assets.
8. INCOME TAXES
The provision for income taxes for 1999 represents current federal
taxes calculated under the alternative minimum tax method. No provision or
benefit for federal or state income taxes was made for 1998 and 1997 due to the
operating losses incurred in the respective periods.
41     The provision for income taxes is different from that which would be
obtained by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to income loss
before income taxes. A reconciliation from the Federal income tax provision at
the statutory rate to the effective rate is as follows in thousands                       FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

assets as realization of such amounts is not considered more likely than not.
The Company reviews the valuation allowance requirement periodically and makes
adjustments as warranted.
At December 31, 1999, the Company has approximately $25,330,000 of net
operating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax reporting purposes available
to offset future taxable income. The carryforwards expire through 2018.
Utilization of such net operating losses may be limited as a result of
cumulative ownership changes in the Company equity instruments. In addition,
the Company has alternative tax credit carryforwards of approximately $22,000
which are available to reduce future Federal regular income taxes, if any, over
an indefinite period.
42 9. STOCK OPTIONS
The Company has adopted The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. Nonqualified
Stock Option Plan the Plan under which the Company is authorized to issue
options to purchase a total of 5,059,500 shares of the Company Common Stock to
directors, officers and employees of the Company. Under the Plan, options to
purchase shares of Common Stock may be granted at prices equal to the market
value of shares of the Company Common Stock as of the date of grant, or at
such other amount as may be determined by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors appointed to administer the Plan the Committee. The
Committee has discretion under the Plan to prescribe vesting periods for options
which are granted under the Plan. In addition, options granted under the Plan
become immediately exercisable in the event of a change in control of the
Company and in certain other circumstances. The maximum term of the options
granted under the Plan is 10 years.
The Plan provides that non-employee members of the Company Board of
Directors shall receive options in lieu of any retainer or meeting fees for
serving on the Board or committees thereof. Such options vest upon the date of
grant and have an exercise price equal to 30% of fair market value of the
Company Common Stock on the date of grant. See Note 10.
A summary of the Company Plan as of December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

1997, dividend yield of 0% for all three years presented, expected volatility of
65% for each of the three years presented and an expected life of three years

44 Description of Capital Stock
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
In October 1998, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a
Stockholders Rights Plan the Rights Plan in which one preferred stock
purchase right was distributed as a dividend for each share of Common Stock held
of record as of the close of business on November 15, 1998 the Right or,
collectively, the Rights.
The Rights are exercisable only if a person or group acquires
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company outstanding Common Stock
or commences or announces a tender offer which would result in such person or
group beneficially owning 15% or more of the Company outstanding Common Stock.
Each Right entitles the holder to buy one one-hundredth of a share of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock for $45.
Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
Pursuant to Board action taken in the second calendar quarter of 1998
following the occurrence of the Release Event see Note 17 the Board
Action, each of the outstanding shares of Series A and Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock was converted into 10119 shares of the Company Common Stock
prior to the closing of the IPO.
Class A, Class B and Class C Common Stock
The shares of the Class A, Class B and Class C Common Stock were
subject to mandatory conversion into shares of Common Stock if the Board of
Directors of the Company declared a mandatory conversion following the

share of Class A, Class B and Class C Common Stock was converted into shares of
the Company Common Stock.

other classes of Common and Preferred Stock and no shares of Common Stock were
issued prior to any such conversion.
The holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share for each
share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders.
Escrow Agreements

with the Transactions were placed in escrow pursuant to an escrow agreement

held until the occurrence of a Release Event. Upon the occurrence of a Release
Event, the Class A Escrow Agreement required the Partnership to return to the
Company for cancellation any shares of Class A Common Stock that the Partnership
was not entitled to retain under a formula that generally measured i the
revenues of the Participating Resellers during a recent 12 month period
preceding the Release Event, against ii the total revenues of the Company in
the same 12 month period. In March 1998, 68,747 of the shares of Class A Common

Product Liability
Software products such as those offered by the Company frequently
contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions
are released. Testing of the Company products is particularly challenging
because it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing environments
in which the Company customers may deploy these products. Despite extensive
testing, the Company from time to time has discovered defects or errors in
products. There can be no assurance that such defects, errors or difficulties
will not cause delays in product introductions and shipments, result in
increased costs and diversion of development resources, require design
modifications or decrease market acceptance or customer satisfaction with the
Company products. In addition, there can be no assurance that, despite testing
by the Company and by current and potential customers, errors will not be found
after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of or delay in
market acceptance, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company
business, operating results and financial condition.
Litigation
From time-to-time, the Company is involved in litigation relating to
claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business. The
Company is not currently a party to any legal proceeding the adverse outcome of
which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company business, operating results and
financial condition.
