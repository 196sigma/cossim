Item8.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA    
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BioSphere Medical,Inc.: 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BioSphere Medical,Inc. as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purposes
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of BioSphere Medical,Inc. at
December31, 2007 and 2006, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
As
discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No48 Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes, and effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Share-Based Payments using the modified
prospective transition method. s/ Ernst YoungLLP Boston, Massachusetts

BIOSPHERE MEDICAL,INC.      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
1.Nature of the Business 
BioSphere Medical,Inc. the Company develops, manufactures and markets products for medical procedures that use embolotherapy. Embolotherapy is the
therapeutic introduction of various biocompatible substances into a patient circulatory system to occlude a blood vessel, either to arrest or prevent hemorrhaging or to devitalize or destroy the
structure or organ by occluding its blood supply. The Company core technologies consist of patented bioengineered polymers. These core technologies are used to produce miniature spherical embolic
particles, or microspheres, which are designed to have uniquely beneficial properties for a variety of applications. The Company principal focus is the application of its Embosphere
Microspheres for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids using a procedure called uterine fibroid embolization UFE. The Company wholly owned subsidiary, BioSphere MedicalSA
BMSA, a French socit anonyme, holds the license to the embolotherapy technology that is the main focus of the Company business. 
The
Company believes that its existing working capital as of December31, 2007, together with anticipated proceeds from sales of microspheres, delivery systems and other products
will be sufficient to fund operating and capital requirements, as currently planned through at least 2008. In the longer term, the Company expects to fund its operations and sustain capital
requirements through a combination of expected proceeds from product sales and capital equipment financing. However, cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned due to a number of
factors, including the Company failure to achieve expected revenue amounts, costs associated with changes in its UFE marketing programs, the outcome of product liability challenges, including the
current product liability lawsuit described under the heading Part1, Item3Legal Proceedings, for which an adverse judgment against the Company may not be adequately
covered by product liability insurance, unanticipated research and development expenses, the scope and results of preclinical and clinical testing, changes in the focus and direction of research and
development programs, competitive and
technological advances, the timing and results of regulatory review at the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA or comparable regulatory agencies in other countries, delays or failures
in the market acceptance of any approved products, including Embosphere Microspheres for UFE, HepaSphere Microspheres and QuadraSphere Microspheres and the need for
additional funds for possible strategic acquisitions of synergistic businesses, products and/or technologies. 
2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Principles of Consolidation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries BMSA, BioSphere Medical
Japan,Inc. and BSMD Ventures,Inc. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Translation of Foreign Currencies  The functional currency of each of the Company foreign subsidiaries is its local currency. The assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiaries are
translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect as of each balance sheet date. Revenue and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during
each reporting period. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account in stockholders' equity. Aggregate foreign exchange transaction gains and losses
resulting from euro to U.S. dollar foreign 
63 
currency
fluctuations on euro-denominated intercompany trade accounts are included in the accompanying statement of operations.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the following: 1the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 2the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and 3the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90days or less, as of the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents. As of
December31, 2007 and 2006, approximately $1484million and $839million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents held by financial institutions in the United States exceeded
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured amounts.  Concentration of Credit Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Risk  The Company has no material concentrations of credit risk, nor is it a party to any financial instruments with material off-balance sheet risk.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities and trade accounts receivable. The estimated
fair value of the Company financial instruments approximates their carrying value. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of
customers and their dispersion across many geographic areas. No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of the outstanding receivables on December31, 2007 or 2006, and no single
customer accounted for greater than 10% of revenue in 2007, 2006 or 2005. 
The
Company places its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities with high credit quality financial institutions. In accordance with the Company investment policy, surplus cash
is invested in investment-grade corporate and U.S. government debt as well as certain asset-backed securities. At December31, 2007, all marketable securities were classified as
available-for-sale, since the Company had the intent and ability to use such securities to satisfy current liabilities as needed. Available-for-sale
marketable securities are carried at their fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying balance sheet.  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company best estimate of the
amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. The Company determines the allowance based on the creditworthiness of customers, age of receivables and on historical
write-off experience and future expectations by location. The Company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the
Company feels it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. 
64  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are stated at cost. The Company provides for depreciation based upon expected useful lives using the straight-line method over
the following estimated useful lives: Office equipment
3-5years Laboratory and manufacturing equipment
3-5years Leasehold improvements
Shorter of lease term or estimated useful life Maintenance
and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of disposed assets and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to the statement of operations.  Goodwill and Other Assets  Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired net of liabilities
assumed when accounted for in accordance with the purchase method of accounting. Between February1999 and November2001, the Company recorded goodwill upon the step acquisition of BMSA. 
The
Company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.
Goodwill was derived from the step acquisition of BMSA, the consolidated subsidiary that holds the license to the embolotherapy platform device that is the main focus of the Company business. In
performing the review, the Company utilizes the two-step approach prescribed under the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Statement No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units, as defined, to the fair value
of these units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company will perform the second step of comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to its
carrying value. For purposes of performing the Goodwill impairment review, management considers itself to be one reporting unit. Based upon the Company review, the Company has not recorded any
impairment charges.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  The Company periodically evaluates the potential impairment of its long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards,
or SFAS, No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets, to determine whether events or changes in
circumstances may indicate that the carrying amount of a recorded asset may not be recoverable. Based on management assessment as of December31, 2007, the Company has determined that no
impairment of long-lived assets exists.  Revenue Recognition  The Company applies the revenue recognition guidelines summarized in Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No104, Revenue
Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when products are shipped and the customer or distributor takes ownership and assumes risk of loss, collection of the relevant
receivable is reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists a valid purchase order from an approved customer or distributor, the sales price is fixed or determinable, payment is
not contingent on resale and the Company does not have any continuing obligations to ensure resale. The Company establishes reserves for potential sales returns and evaluates the adequacy of those
reserves based upon realized experience and expectations. Any significant credit returns could have a material adverse impact on the Company revenue and operating results for the period or periods
in which such returns materialize. Shipping and handling costs are included in costs of product sales. 
65 
In
September2006, the Company entered into an agreement to license certain patent technologies to a third party in exchange for an upfront lump-sum payment of
$250,000 and an additional 4% royalty on future net sales of the licensed products. Under the agreement, the third party is required to pay a minimum royalty of $100million over the first
three years of the agreement. The Company will recognize both the lump-sum payment and the minimum royalties over the estimated useful life of the patent. The Company recognized
approximately $417,000 and $104,000, respectively, as licensing revenue during the years ending December31, 2007 and 2006.  Research and Development  Research and development costs include payroll, facility costs, administrative expenses, and third-party costs related to: developing new products, making
technological improvements to existing products and production methods. Research and development costs are expensed in the period incurred. Preclinical testing of product candidates and clinical
trials and product validation costs associated with recently released products are also included in research and development expenses.  Income Taxes  The Company uses the asset and liability accounting method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the
financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using current statutory tax rates. A valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets is recorded if, based on the available evidence,
it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management evaluates, on a quarterly basis, the ability to recover the deferred tax assets and the level of
the valuation allowance. Due to the size of the net operating loss carryforward in relation to the Company history of unprofitable operations, the Company has not recognized any of its net deferred
tax assets. However, future improvements in operational performance, if any, could result in the increased certainty of the ability to apply deferred tax assets against taxable income, which could, in
turn, result in a significant impact on the value of the Company deferred tax assets and reported operating results. Effective
January1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No48 FIN48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxesan Interpretation of FASB109 the Interpretation. The Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
enterprise financial statements in accordance with SFAS No109. The Interpretation proscribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition of an
income tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company adoption did not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position as it did not recognize any assets or liabilities
for unrecognized tax benefits relative to uncertain tax positions upon adoption of the Interpretation.  Comprehensive Income  Other comprehensive income includes certain changes in equity that are excluded from net loss; specifically, the effects of foreign currency translation
adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities, which are reflected separately in stockholders' equity in 
66 
accumulated
other comprehensive income. The components of accumulated other comprehensive income are as follows: December31 in thousands 2007
2006 Foreign exchange currency translation 703 192 Unrealized gains losses on investments 6 4 Total accumulated other comprehensive income 709 188 Net Loss Per Share  Basic net loss per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share
incorporates the dilutive effect of common stock equivalent options, warrants and other convertible securities. Shares used to compute dilutive net loss per share exclude the following common share
equivalents as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect. As of December31 in thousands 2007

5,178 Stock Options  The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment SFAS123R, beginning
January1, 2006, using the modified prospective transition method. This statement requires the Company to measure the cost of employee services in exchange for an award of equity instruments
based on the grant-date fair value of the award and to recognize cost over the requisite service period. Under the modified prospective transition method, the Company has not adjusted its
financial statements for periods prior to the date of adoption for the change in accounting. However, the Company will recognize compensation expense for aall share-based payments granted
after the effective date and ball awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date. The Company recognizes compensation expense on fixed
awards with pro rata vesting on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of such awards. 
Prior
to January1, 2006, the Company used the intrinsic value method to account for stock-based employee compensation under Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and, therefore, the Company did not recognize compensation expense in association with
employee options granted at or above the market price of the Company common stock at the date of grant. 
SFAS123R
requires the presentation of pro forma information for periods prior to adoption as if the Company had accounted for all stock-based compensation expense under the fair
value method of those statements. The following table presents a reconciliation of reported net loss and per share 
67  information
to pro forma net loss and per share information that would have been reported if the fair value method had been used to account for stock-based employee compensation for 2005: in thousands, except per share amounts 
For the Year Ended
December31,
2005 Net loss applicable to common stockholders As reported 3,296 Pro forma compensation expense 872 Pro forma net loss 4,168 Basic and diluted loss per share As reported 022 Pro forma 028 Reclassifications  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. In connection with
preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company concluded that it was appropriate to classify its support of certain international trade shows initiated by the
international sales force as marketing expenses. Previously, such trade show costs were classified as selling expenses. This revision in classification does not affect total operating costs and
expenses. In connection with preparation of the accompanying consolidated
statements of cash flows, the Company concluded that it was appropriate to classify the foreign currency loss on intercompany transactions within operating activities. This revision in classification
does not affect the net change in cash and cash equivalents.  New Accounting Pronouncements  In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements, or SFAS157.
SFAS157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair
value measurements. SFAS157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the FASB having previously concluded in those accounting
pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, SFAS157 does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS157 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier adoption permitted. The provisions of SFAS157 should be applied prospectively as of the
beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied, with limited exceptions. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS157 will have a material impact on its results of
operations, financial position or cash flows. 
In
February2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an
amendment of FASB Statement No115, or SFAS159. SFAS159 permits entities to choose to measure eligible financial assets or liabilities, which include
marketable securities available-for-sale and equity method investments, at fair value at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the
fair value option has been elected in earnings. SFAS159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The Company has not completed its evaluation of the
Interpretation, but does not currently believe the adoption of SFAS159 will have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
In
June2007, the FASB ratified Emerging Issue Task Force EITF No07-3, Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or
Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development Activities, or EITF07-3. The EITF concluded that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or
services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities should be deferred 
68  and
capitalized. The capitalized amounts should be expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. If an entity expectations change such that it does not expect it will
need the goods to be delivered or the services to be rendered, capitalized nonrefundable advance payments should be charged to expense. EITF07-3 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December15, 2007, including interim periods within those years. The Company has not completed its evaluation of the EITF, but does not currently believe the adoption will have
a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
In
December2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No141R, Business Combinations, or
SFAS141R, a replacement of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No141, Business Combinations, or SFAS141.
SFAS141R applies to all transactions and other events in which an entity obtains control over one or more other businesses. The statement changes the principles and requirements for how the
acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. The statement
also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate
the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This statement is effective prospectively, except for certain retrospective adjustments to deferred tax balances, for fiscal years
beginning after December15, 2008. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS141R will have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In
December2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements: an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No51, or SFAS160. SFAS160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for
noncontrolling interest formally referred to as minority interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically the statement requires the recognition of a
noncontrolling interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent equity. The amount of net income attributable to a noncontrolling interest will be included in
consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. SFAS160 clarifies that changes in a parent ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity
transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, SFAS160 requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated.
Such gains or losses will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date. SFAS160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding
the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. SFAS160 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December15,
2008, with early adoption prohibited. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS160 will have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 3.Goodwill 
Goodwill equaled $144million as of December31, 2007 and 2006 and was comprised entirely of the unamortized purchase price paid in excess of the

4.Marketable Securities and Cash Equivalents 
All current fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value. The Company has determined
that its investment securities are available to support current operations and, accordingly, has classified such marketable securities as current assets without regard for contractual maturities. The
unrealized gains or losses on these securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders' equity unless the decline in value is deemed to be
other-than-temporary, in which case securities are written down to fair 
69  value
and the loss is charged to income. The Company evaluates its investment securities for other-than-temporary declines based on quantitative and qualitative factors. The

Company currently has a credit facility with a bank under which it may borrow up to $300million for general working capital and corporate purposes. The credit facility
expires in June 2009. There were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement as of December31, 2007 or 2006. Each available 30-, 60-, 90- or
180- day advance will bear interest at a per annum rate, at the Company option, equal to either ia variable rate as determined by the bank or iia rate equal to the
corresponding 30-, 60-, 90- or 180-day LIBOR rate 502% as of December31, 2007 plus a LIBOR advance rate spread as determined by certain
current working capital balances at the time of the advance. In connection with the credit facility, the Company entered into a security agreement pursuant to which the Company has pledged to the bank
all of the Company U.S. assets, excluding its equity ownership of its subsidiaries including BMSA, as collateral. Letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business totaled $447,000 as of
December31, 2007, and were collateralized by the Company credit facility noted above. 
The
Company leases approximately 13,000 square feet of office and laboratory space at its Rockland, Massachusetts facility under an operating lease expiring in February 2009 for
approximately $234,000 per year, exclusive of periodic operating and maintenance expenses. BMSA leases approximately 18,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space in Roissy, France, through May
2010 for approximately 270,000 per year approximately $400,000 as of December31, 2007. The Company also has several operating leases covering certain pieces of manufacturing
and office equipment through 2010. 
72 
The
Company has entered into several capital lease agreements in connection with the acquisition of certain manufacturing, computer and communication equipment. The leases have initial
terms of 36 to 60months with interest rates of 46% to 87%. All equipment leased under these agreements serves as pledged capital. Future
minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases and capital leases in effect as of December31, 2007, are as follows: in thousands

10.Income Taxes 
The components of the Company pre-tax income loss by tax jurisdiction, net of any intercompany transactions, are as follows: FortheyearsendedDecember31 in thousands 2007

2005 United States 2,875 2,815 3,100 France 1,021 491 206 Pretax loss 1,854 2,324 2,894 For
the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, the increase in the valuation allowance relating to losses not resulting in a current period tax benefit is the primary
difference between the income tax provision benefit recorded by the Company and the amount of the income tax benefit would be at statutory income tax rates. During the years presented, the profit
earned in France was fully offset by previous net operating loss carryforwards. The 2005 income tax benefit of $93,000 primarily represents the realization of income tax benefits, as a portion of the
2001 taxes paid in France were recovered. 
As
of December31, 2007, the Company had federal net operating loss NOL carryforwards of approximately $7301million, which will expire through the year
2027, state NOL carryforwards of approximately $2400million, which will expire through the year 2017, and foreign NOL carryforwards of approximately $376million, which do not expire.
During the year ended December31, 2007 approximately $600million of state NOLs expired. The Company has $185,000 of research and development credit carryforwards to offset future
income taxes, which will expire through the year 
73  2018.
The components of the Company net deferred tax asset at December31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: December31 in thousands 2007
2006 Assets derived from the following NOL carryforwards 26,513 26,981 Tax credit carryforwards 185 186 Other 702 374 Subtotal 27,400 27,541 Valuation allowance 27,400 27,541 Net deferred tax asset Utilization
of the NOL carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 due to ownership change limitations
that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of NOL credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income
and tax, respectively. The Company has not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change has occurred, or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since its formation, due to the
significant complexity and related cost associated with such study. There also could be additional ownership changes in the future which may result in additional limitations in the utilization of the
carryforward NOLs and credits. 
As
discussed in Note2, the Company adopted SFAS123R effective January1, 2006 for stock-based compensation plans. Generally, tax return deductions are allowable on
such arrangements but may arise in different amounts and periods from compensation costs recognized on financial statements. Pursuant to SFAS123R, if the tax return deduction for an award
exceeds the cumulative compensation cost recognized on the financial statements, any excess tax benefit shall be recognized as additional paid-in-capital when the deduction
reduces taxes payable. Prior to
adoption, the Company recognized deferred tax assets, along with an offsetting valuation allowance, for net operating loss carryforwards that included deductions for excess tax benefits from
stock-based compensation. Included in the net operating loss carryforward stated above is approximately $764million of unrealized excess tax benefit. In addition, the Company also has
$238million of additional net operating losses resulting from excess tax benefits that were recognized after the adoption of FAS123R. 
The
Company has established a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of December31, 2007, as it considers the realizable value of any tax benefit against
future taxable income to be uncertain. The change in the valuation allowance from December31, 2006 to December31, 2007 is a result of the increase in NOL carryforwards from the
inclusion of the current period loss offset by a decrease in state NOL carryforwards due to expiration and the utilization of foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The
2005 income tax benefit of $93,000 primarily represents the realization of income tax benefits, as a portion of the 2001 taxes paid in France were recovered. 
In
June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of
FAS109 FIN48. This statement clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be
recognized in a company financial statements. The Company adopted FIN No48 on January1, 2007. The implementation of FIN No48 did not have a material impact on the Company
consolidated financial statements, results of operations or cash flows. At the adoption date of January1, 2007, and also at December30, 2007, the Company had no unrecognized tax
benefits. The Company has not, as yet, conducted a study of its 
74  research
and development credit carryforwards; This study may result in an adjustment to the Company research and development credit carryforwards, however, until a study is completed and any
adjustment is known, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position under FIN48. A full valuation allowance has been provided against the Company research and development
credits and, if an adjustment is required, this adjustment would be offset by an adjustment to the valuation allowance. Thus, there would be no impact to the consolidated balance sheet or statement of
operations if an adjustment were required. 
11.Segment Information 
The Company develops microspheres and other ancillary embolotherapy products for use in the treatment of uterine fibroids, other hypervascularized tumors and
arteriovenous malformations. The Company operates exclusively in the medical device business, which the Company considers as one business segment pursuant to SFAS No131,

placement. Upon payment of all offering expenses, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $1350million. The proceeds are being used to fund current operations.  Preferred Stock  Under the certificate of incorporation of the Company, the Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of $001 par value preferred stock
from time to time in one or more series with such preferences terms and rights as the Board of Directors may determine without further action by the stockholders of the Company. Accordingly, the Board
of Directors has the power to establish the provisions, if any, relating to dividends, voting rights, redemption rates, liquidation preferences and conversion rights for any series of preferred stock
issued in the future.  6% SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock  In November 2004, the Company completed a private placement of $800million of its seriesA convertible preferred stock seriesA preferred
stock and warrants to purchase common stock with 
75 
SepracorInc.
and affiliates of Cerberus Capital Management,L.P., two existing investors. These investors purchased a total of 8,000 shares of seriesA preferred stock, which are
initially convertible into 2,000,000 shares of common stock based upon a conversion price of $400 per share. In addition, the Company has the right to convert the seriesA preferred stock into
common stock, or redeem it, under specified circumstances. The seriesA preferred stock has a 6% dividend, which is payable quarterly in either cash or additional shares of seriesA
preferred stock, at the Company election. Additionally, the investors were issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 400,000 shares of common stock. These warrants expire five years from the date
of issuance and have an initial exercise price of $400 per share. These warrants were assigned a value of $850,000 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Through December31, 2007, the
Company issued 1,495 shares of seriesA preferred stock in payment of seriesA preferred stock dividends requirements. 
13.Stock Plans  Stock Incentive Plans  As of December31, 2007, the Company has granted options and/or restricted stock awards under the following three stock-based compensation plans:
ithe 2006 Stock Incentive Plan the 2006 Plan, which was adopted by the Company Board of Directors on March9, 2006 and was approved by the Company stockholders on
May10, 2006 and which authorizes the issuance of up to an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of common stock to officers, directors, advisors, consultants and employees of the Company;
iithe 1997 Stock Option Plan the 1997 Plan, which expired March 2007 and, accordingly, has no shares available for future grant; iiithe 1994 Director Option Plan the Director
Plan, which expired in January 2000 and, accordingly, has no shares available for future grant. The Company 2006 Plan and 1997 Plan each provide for the grant of Incentive Stock Options ISOs
to officers and employees and Non-Statutory Stock Options NSOs to officers, directors, advisors, consultants and employees of the Company. Options granted under such plans generally
become exercisable in five equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of the grant and have a maximum term of ten years from the date of grant. The Company Director
Plan provided for the grant of NSOs to directors of the Company who are not officers or employees of the
Company or any subsidiary of the Company. Options granted under the Director Plan vest in either two or five equal installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of the grant depending on
the nature of the grant and have a maximum term of ten years from the date of grant. At December31, 2007 there were 1,285,000 shares available for future grant under the 2006 Plan. 
The
2006 Plan and 1997 Plan also provide for the grant of restricted stock awards to officers, directors, advisors, consultants and employees of the Company. Generally, the restricted
stock awards are subject to a right of repurchase by the Company if service is terminated prior to specified dates and/or if specified performance conditions are not met, which right of repurchase
lapses over time. Ownership of restricted stock cannot be transferred, except under specified circumstances, until the foregoing repurchase restrictions have lapsed. In connection with restricted
stock grants, the Company records compensation expense based on the fair value of the shares at the time of grant, which is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods. 
On
June1, 2006, the Board of Directors awarded an aggregate of 400,000 shares of restricted common stock to the Company existing executive officers under the 2006 Plan. These
shares of restricted common stock are subject to a right of repurchase by the Company, which lapses on June1, 2010, subject to the achievement by the Company of specified gains in the market
price of its common stock. If on June1, 2010, the four-year cumulative total stockholder return on the Company common stock is equal in dollar amount to the four-year
cumulative total return for the NASDAQ Medical Equipment Index NASDAQ Index, 25% of the restricted stock award will vest and no longer be subject to the repurchase option. An additional 16304% of
the restricted stock award will vest and become free of the repurchase option for each one percentage that the four-year cumulative total 
76  stockholder
return on the Company common stock exceeds the four-year cumulative total return for the NASDAQ Index. The aggregate intrinsic value of the 400,000 shares of the Company
common stock at the date of grant underlying the restricted stock awards was $240million, based on the closing price of the Company common stock on the NASDAQ National Market on the date of
grant. The Company utilized a Monte-Carlo simulation method to estimate a range of possible future stock prices over the four-year period for the Company common stock and the NASDAQ
Index to estimate the number of restricted shares that may vest based upon such simulation. Using the Monte-Carlo simulation method, the Company calculated an aggregate compensation cost of $580,000
at the time of the grant. The Company is recognizing this compensation cost over the four-year service period whether or not the market condition is actually satisfied. However, in the
event one or more of the participants voluntarily terminates before the end of the four-year period, some amounts of the charge will be reversed. In the event that a qualifying change in
the control of the Company occurs prior to June1, 2010, the Company repurchase option will fully lapse, and the Company will then recognize a compensation change equal to the full
$240million intrinsic value less any previously recognized compensation expense. In connection with the resignation of one of the Company executive officers on July27, 2007, the
Company exercised its right to repurchase all 100,000 shares of the common stock issued to this executive at the price per share originally paid by the executive. 
Pursuant
to the Company 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Company may issue and sell to its eligible employees up to an aggregate of 100,000 shares of common stock at a purchase
price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or last day of each six-month offering period. Eligible employees may elect to have up to a maximum of 10% of their
regular compensation withheld through payroll deductions to pay the purchase price of the shares at the end of the offering period, subject to limitations specified in the plan. 
As
discussed in Note2, the Company adopted SFAS123R beginning January1, 2006. Stock-based compensation expense relates to stock options, restricted stock and
stock issued under the Company employee stock purchase plan. This statement requires the Company to measure the cost of employee services in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the
grant-date fair value of the award and to recognize cost over the requisite service period. The Company recognizes compensation expense on fixed awards with pro rata vesting on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period of such awards. 
The
fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following weighted average assumptions: FortheYears

SFAS123R requires the application of an estimated forfeiture
rate to current period expense to recognize stock-based compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest. The Company estimates forfeitures based upon historical data, adjusted for known
trends, and will adjust its estimate of forfeitures if actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ from such estimates. Subsequent changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized through
a cumulative adjustment in the period of change and will also impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense in future periods. Changes

aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding at December31, 2007 of $238million is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the
underlying stock options and the market price of the Company common stock for the 1,272,550 shares of common stock underlying stock options that had exercise prices that were lower than the $513
closing market price of the Company common stock at December31, 2007. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options vested or expected to vest at December31, 2007 is
$134million. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercisable at December31, 2007 is $218million. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $338,000 230million and $256million during the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, determined as of the date of exercise.

aggregate intrinsic value of restricted shares outstanding at December31, 2007 is $170million. 
At
December31, 2007, there was $417million and $363,000 of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to non-vested stock options
and restricted stock awards, respectively, which the Company expects to recognize over weighted-average periods of 298years and 227years, respectively. At December31, 2006,
there was $315million and $579,000 of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to non-vested stock options and restricted stock 
78  awards,
respectively, which the Company expects to recognize over weighted-average periods of 370years and 324years, respectively. However, the amount of stock compensation expense
recognized in any future period cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the future. The adoption of SFAS123R did not require any
cumulative adjustments to the Company financial statements.  Employee Stock Purchase Plan  Under the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the 2000 ESPP, an aggregate of 100,000 shares of common stock may be purchased by employees at 85% of the fair
market value on the first or last day of each six-month offering period, whichever is lower. During each offering period, the maximum number of shares that may be purchased by a
participating employee is determined on the first day of the offering period and is equal to the number of shares of common stock determined by dividing $12,500 by the last reported sale price of the
common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on the first day of the offering. An eligible employee may elect to have up to a maximum of 10% deducted through payroll deductions from his or her regular
salary. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, 18,370, 21,801 and 7,836 shares of the Company common stock were issued under the
2000 ESPP. During the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company recognized $17,000 and $43,000, respectively, of equity compensation related to the issuance of shares under the 2000
ESPP.

The Company has a 401k savings plan for all domestic employees pursuant to which eligible employees may voluntarily contribute up to $15,500 subject to
statutory limitations. In addition, the Company matches in cash 50% of the first $3,000 contributed by employees up to a $1,500 maximum
per employee per year. Employer cash matching contributions amounted to approximately $46,000, $43,000, and $36,000 for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 15.Valuation and Qualifying Accounts

On August17, 2005, a lawsuit commenced in the Circuit Court, Twenty-Second Judicial Circuit, St.Louis, Missouri, captioned Brett Pingel by next friend
Dawn LaRose vs. BioSphere Medical,Inc., Bruce Kirke Bieneman, M.D., St.Louis University Hospital, John Stith, M.D. and
St.Louis University. The lawsuit alleges, among other things, that a patient suffered permanent bilateral blindness as a result of the use of the Company EmboGold
Microspheres or the negligence of the health-care providers or both factors combined. All defendants have denied the allegations against them. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive
damages. The Company carries product liability insurance, and this case is currently being defended by the Company insurer under reservation of rights with respect to the claim of punitive damages,
for which an exclusion from coverage exists. The Company has filed an answer to this lawsuit in which it has denied the claims being made. Some pretrial discovery has been completed, but no party has
disclosed any expert opinions. The case is presently set for trial on October27, 2008. The Company intends to defend against the claims vigorously. However, the Company cannot give any
assurance that it will prevail or that all or any part of its liability, if any, would be covered by its product liability insurance. Accordingly, the Company is currently unable to predict the
financial impact of this product liability litigation.

39 Part II Item 5.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES     1.Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our
management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
December31, 2007. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act, means controls and other
procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to the company management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its
judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2007,
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, the Company disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 2.Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
aManagement Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The
management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial
reporting is defined in Rule13a-15f or 15d-15f promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
Company principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and
procedures that: pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The
Company management assessed the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007. In making this assessment, the Company
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. 
Based
on our assessment, management concluded that, as of as of December31, 2007, the Company internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. bAttestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm We
