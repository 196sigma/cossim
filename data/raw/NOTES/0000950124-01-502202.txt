INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of
TALX Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TALX Corporation
and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2000 and 2001, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2001. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TALX Corporation and
subsidiaries as of March 31, 2000 and 2001, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March
31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. s/ KPMG LLP

1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a Description of Business
TALX Corporation is the leading provider of automated employment and income
verification services and a leader in providing outsourced employee self-service
applications. We use interactive web and interactive voice response software and
other technologies to enable an organization employees, managers and other
authorized users to access, input and update payroll, benefits and other
employment-related information. Our services and software are designed to
enhance service levels, improve productivity and reduce costs by automating
historically labor-intensive, paper-based processes and enabling users to
perform self-service transactions. Our clients are typically large
organizations, including approximately 150 of the Fortune 500 and government
agencies.
b Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TALX Corporation
and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.
c Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.
d Short-term Investments
Short-term investments at March 31, 2000 and 2001, consist of U.S. government
agency debt instruments. We classify our debt and marketable equity securities
in one of two categories: available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.
Held-to-maturity securities are those securities which we have the ability and
intent to hold until maturity. All other securities are classified as
available-for-sale. All of our securities were classified as available-for-sale
at March 31, 2000 and 2001. Interest income is recognized when earned. Debt
securities classified as available-for-sale are stated at market value.
e Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost average or market. Inventories
consist primarily of hardware and spare parts.
f Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation is computed using straight-line and accelerated
methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Amortization of leasehold
improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of the
useful life of the asset or lease term.
g Product Development and Capitalized Software Development Costs
Product development costs are charged to operations as incurred. Software
development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is
achieved, after which they are capitalized on a product-by-product basis.
Amortization of capitalized software development costs is computed using the
straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product.
Amortization of capitalized software development costs starts when the product
is available for general release to clients.

MARCH 31, 2000 AND 2001
h Revenue Recognition, Work in Progress and Progress Billings
Revenues from The Work Number are recognized from fees charged to users for
verifications of employment history and income, and from maintenance and
employer conversion fees. We recognize hardware and software license revenue
upon shipment based on vendor-specific objective evidence. Revenues for
customization services are recognized by the contract method of accounting using
percentage of completion for larger, more complex systems and the completed
contract method for smaller systems. Application services revenue is recognized
as the services are provided. Revenue from maintenance contracts is deferred and
recognized ratably over the maintenance period. Deferred maintenance revenue
represents the unearned portion of maintenance fees.
i Concentration of Credit Risk
We sell our services and software in a variety of industries. No client
represented over 10% of revenues in fiscal 1999, 2000 or 2001. We perform
periodic credit evaluations of our clients' financial condition and generally do
not require collateral; however, we maintain a security interest in hardware
until payment is received. Credit losses from clients have been within
management expectations, and management believes the allowance for doubtful
accounts adequately provides for any expected losses.
j Income Taxes
We record income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date.
k Fair Value of Financial Instruments
We disclose estimated fair values for our financial instruments. A financial
instrument is defined as cash or a contract that both imposes on one entity a
contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial instrument to a
second entity and conveys to that second entity a contractual right to receive
cash or another financial instrument from the first entity.
l Stock Option Plans
We record stock-based compensation over the vesting period for the difference
between the quoted market price of an award at the date of grant and the
exercise price of the option, if any. We provide pro forma net income and pro
forma earnings per share disclosures for employee stock option grants made in
1995 and later years as if the fair-value-based method had been applied.
m Management Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ materially from those estimates.

n Net Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the
incremental increase in common shares outstanding assuming the exercise of all
employee stock options and warrants that would have had a dilutive effect on
earnings per share.
o Reclassifications
Certain balances in prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform to the
presentation adopted in the current fiscal year.
2 RESTRUCTURING CHARGE
During the quarter ended December 31, 1998, we reorganized our sales and
delivery operations and refocused our product line related to our customer
premises systems business. In conjunction with the reorganization, we reduced
our workforce by approximately 8% and closed certain regional sales offices. As
a result of these actions, we incurred restructuring charges of $318,000 related
to employee severance costs and $178,000 of other costs. These items are
reflected in the line item restructuring charge on the statement of operations
for the year ended March 31, 1999 and no amounts remain on the balance sheets at
March 31, 2000 and 2001.
3 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Effective March 31, 2000, we sold all of the assets, net of liabilities, of the
database services business to WPZ Holdings, Inc., the parent company of one of
the division largest customers. The sales price was $1,273,000, which
represented the current book value of the net assets sold. We realized pre-tax
and after-tax gains of $187,000 and $117,000, respectively. While the effective
date of the transaction was March 31, 2000, cash settlement occurred April 5,
2000. At March 31, 2000, the receivable for the sales price is included in
prepaid expenses and other current assets.
During the quarter ended September 30, 2000, we concluded all transition-related
activity for the database services business. Completing this transition ahead of
schedule resulted in a savings of $61,000 of the transition reserve. Therefore,
we realized pre-tax and after-tax gains of $61,000 and $37,000, respectively.
The results of operations for the database business for the years ended March
31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 were as follows                                MARCH 31,

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions
of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at March 31, 2000 and

In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the
scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income
and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Our taxable income for
the years ended March 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 was $624,000, $5,860,000 and
$6,400,000, respectively. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and
projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax
assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not we will
realize the benefits of these deductible differences.

No compensation cost has been recognized for the stock option plans. Had
compensation cost for the Company stock option plans been recognized for
awards in fiscal 1999, net earnings would be reduced by $235,000 or $002 per
share, based on the weighted average fair value of options granted of $337 per
option. The effect for fiscal 2000 would be to reduce net earnings by $156,000
or $002 per share, based on the weighted average fair value of options granted
of $507 per option. The effect for fiscal 2001 would be to reduce net earnings
by $394,000 or $004 per share, based on the weighted average fair value of
options granted of $936 per option.
The full impact of calculating compensation cost for stock options under SFAS
No. 123 was not reflected in the determination of the impact, because
compensation cost is reflected over the options' vesting period of six to ten
years and compensation cost for options granted prior to April 1, 1995 is not
considered. The fair value of option grants for fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001 is
estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following weighted-average assumptions: expected volatility of 65%, 86%
and 62% in fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively; risk-free interest rate of
500%, 600% and 491% in fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively; expected
life of 45, 45 and 50 years in fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively; and
an expected dividend yield of 00%, 00% and 35% in fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001,
respectively.

eligible employees the right to purchase common stock on a quarterly basis at
the lower of 85% of the market price at the beginning or end of each three-month
offering period. Of the 825,000 shares of common stock shares reserved for the
ESPP, there were 538,041 shares remaining at March 31, 2001.
12 DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
