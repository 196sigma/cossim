PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors
MAXIMUS,Inc. We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MAXIMUS,Inc. as of September30,
2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended September30, 2005. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of MAXIMUS,Inc. at September30,
2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended September30, 2005,
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States, the effectiveness of MAXIMUS,Inc.s internal control
over financial reporting as of September30, 2005, based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November22,
2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Statements
For the years ended September30,
2003, 2004 and 2005 1. Business and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies aDescription of Business MAXIMUS,Inc. the Company
or we provides consulting, systems solutions and operations program
management primarily to government. The Company conducts its operations through
three business segments: Consulting, Systems and Operations. The Consulting Segment
provides specialized financial consulting services such as assisting states, local
agencies, and schools in obtaining federal funding reimbursements for their
programs, and implementing cost reductions strategies, as well as providing technical
services and software products. The Systems Segment provides systems products
including justice and asset software solutions as well as systems development,
design and implementation to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of
program administration. The Operations Segment provides a variety of program
management services, primarily the delivery of administrative services for
government health and human service programs. The Company operates
predominantly in the United States. Revenue from foreign-based projects and
offices was less than 10% of total revenue for the years ended September30,
2003, 2004 and 2005. bPrinciples
of Consolidation The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of MAXIMUS,Inc. and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. In addition to the Companys wholly owned subsidiaries, the
financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended September30,
2005 include a majority 55% owned international subsidiary. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. cRevenue Recognition In fiscal 2005, approximately 78% of our total
revenue was derived from state and local government agencies; 7% from federal
government agencies; 8% from foreign customers; and 7% from other sources, such
as commercial customers.
Revenue is generated from contracts with various pricing arrangements,
including: 1fixed-price; 2performance-based criteria; 3costs
incurred plus a negotiated fee cost-plus; and 4time and materials.
Also, some contracts contain not-to-exceed provisions. For fiscal 2005,
revenue from fixed-price contracts was approximately 33% of total revenue;
revenue from performance-based contracts was approximately 40% of total
revenue; revenue from cost-plus contracts was approximately 15% of total
revenue; and revenue from time and materials contracts was approximately 12% of
total revenue. A majority of the contracts with state and local government
agencies have been fixed-price and performance-based, and our contracts with
the federal government generally have been cost-plus. Fixed-price and
performance-based contracts generally offer higher margins but typically
involve more risk than cost-plus or time and materials reimbursement contracts. We
recognize revenue on fixed-priced contracts when earned, as services are
provided. For certain fixed-price contracts, primarily systems design,
development and implementation, we recognize revenue based on costs incurred
using estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs to be 34 incurred.
The cumulative impact of any revisions in estimated revenue and costs is
recognized in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision
become known. For other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognized on a
straight-line basis unless evidence suggests that revenue is earned or
obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. With fixed-price contracts,
we are subject to the risk of potential cost overruns. Provisions for estimated
losses on incomplete contracts are provided in full in the period in which such
losses become known. We recognize revenue on performance-based contracts as
such revenue becomes fixed or determinable, which generally occurs when amounts
are billable to customers. For certain contracts, this may result in revenue
being recognized in irregular increments. Additionally, costs related to
contracts may be incurred in periods prior to recognizing revenue. These costs
are generally expensed. However, certain direct and incremental set-up costs
may be deferred until services are provided and revenue begins to be
recognized, when such costs are recoverable from a contractual arrangement.
Set-up costs are costs related to activities that enable us to provide
contractual services to a client. These factors may result in irregular revenue
and profit margins. Revenue
on cost-plus contracts is recognized based on costs incurred plus an estimate
of the negotiated fee earned. Revenue on time and materials contracts is
recognized based on hours worked and expenses incurred. Our
most significant expense is cost of revenue, which consists primarily of
project-related costs such as employee salaries and benefits, subcontractors,
computer equipment and travel expenses. Our management uses its judgment and
experience to estimate cost of revenue expected on projects. Our managements
ability to accurately predict personnel requirements, salaries and other costs
as well as to effectively manage a project or achieve certain levels of
performance can have a significant impact on the gross margins related to our fixed-price,
performance-based and time and materials contracts. If actual costs are higher
than our managements estimates, profitability may be adversely affected.
Service cost variability has little impact on cost-plus arrangements because
allowable costs are reimbursed by the customer. We
also license software under license agreements. License fee revenue is
recognized when a non-cancelable license agreement is in force, the product has
been delivered, the license fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is
probable. If the fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is recognized as
payments become due from the customer. In addition, when software license
contracts contain post-contract customer support as part of a multiple element
arrangement, revenue is recognized based upon the vendor-specific objective
evidence of the fair value of each element. Maintenance and post-contract
customer support revenue are recognized ratably over the term of the related
agreements, which in most cases is one year. Revenue from software-related
consulting services under time and material contracts and for training is
recognized as services are performed. Revenue from other software-related
contract services requiring significant modification or customization of software
is recognized under the percentage-of-completion method. Beginning
July1, 2003, EITF 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables, requires contracts with multiple deliverables
to be divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met.
While EITF 00-21 has not had a material impact on our financial statements, we
apply the guidance therein and recognize revenue on multiple deliverables as
separate units of accounting if the criteria are met. 35 dCash
Equivalents The Company considers all
highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less
when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are valued at cost,
which approximates market. eAccounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are
recorded at their face amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful
accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk of
collecting less than full payment on our receivables. On a regular basis
we re-evaluate our client receivables, especially receivables that are past
due, and reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific client
collection issues. fRestricted
Cash Restricted cash
represents amounts collected on behalf of certain customers and its use is
restricted to the purposes specified under our contracts with these customers. gMarketable
Securities Marketable securities are
classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair market value with
unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a separate component of
shareholders equity. Realized gains losses and declines in market value
judged to be other than temporary, of which there were none in 2003 and 2004
and $288,000 in 2005, are included in other income. Interest and dividends
are also included in other income. Marketable securities consist primarily of short-term
auction rate bonds. At September30, 2003, 2004 and 2005, accumulated unrealized
gains losses on marketable securities, net of tax, included in accumulated
other comprehensive income loss, were approximately $50,000, $90,000 and $150,000
respectively. hProperty
and Equipment Property and equipment is
stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method based on
estimated useful lives not to exceed 395years for the Companys
buildings and between three and seven years for office furniture and equipment.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over their useful life or the remaining
term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Direct costs of time and material
incurred for the application development of software for internal use are
capitalized as property and equipment. These costs are depreciated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, ranging
from three to seven years. iSoftware
Development Costs Capitalized software
development costs are capitalized in accordance with FAS No86, Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or
Otherwise Marketed. The Company capitalizes both purchased software
that is ready for resale and costs incurred internally for software development
projects from the time technological feasibility is established. Capitalized
software development costs are reported at the lower of unamortized cost or
estimated net realizable value. Upon the general release of the software to customers,
capitalized software development costs for the products are amortized over the greater
of the ratio of gross revenues to expected total revenues of the product or on
the straight-line method of amortization over the estimated economic life of
the product, which ranges 36 from three to five years. j Deferred Contract Costs Deferred contract costs
consist of contractually recoverable direct set-up costs relating to long-term service
contracts in progress. These costs include system development and facility
build-out costs that are expensed over the period services are provided under
the long-term service contract. k Goodwill and Intangible Assets The Company applies Statements
of Financial Accounting Standards No141, Business
Combinations FAS 141, and No142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets FAS 142. Under these rules, goodwill is
not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with FAS
142. Annually, the Company performs a fair value analysis of its reporting
units using valuation techniques prescribed in FAS 142. Based on the analysis
performed as of July1,2005, the Company determined that there had
been no impairment of goodwill. Intangible assets from
acquisitions, which consist primarily of customer contracts and relationships,
technology-based intangibles and non-competition agreements, are amortized over
five to ten years, based on their estimated useful lives. l Long-Lived
Assets excluding Goodwill The Company follows the
provisions of Financial Accounting Standards No144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets FAS 144. FAS
144 requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events
or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the long-term
undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the long-lived
assets being evaluated. Any write-downs are treated as permanent reductions in
the carrying amount of the assets. The Company believes that the carrying
values of its assets as of September30, 2005 are fully realizable. m
Income Taxes Deferred tax liabilities
and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected
to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized
in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A tax
benefit or expense is recognized for the net change in the deferred tax asset
or liability during the year and the current tax liability for the year. n Comprehensive income loss Comprehensive income
loss includes changes in the balances of the items that are reported directly
as separate components of shareholders equity. Comprehensive income loss
includes net income plus changes in the net unrealized gain loss on
investments, net of taxes, and changes in cumulative foreign currency translation
adjustments. o Foreign Currency The assets and
liabilities of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current
exchange 37 rates and revenue and
expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. The resulting
cumulative translation adjustment is included in accumulated other
comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheet. At September30,
2003, 2004 and 2005, accumulated foreign currency gains losses included in
accumulated other comprehensive loss were approximately $45,000, $255,000 and
$673,000, respectively. Foreign currency transaction gains losses,
including foreign currency gains losses on short-term loans with our foreign
subsidiaries, are included in other income and were approximately $511,000 and $396,000
for the years ended September30, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Foreign
currency transaction gains losses were not significant for the year ended September30,
2003. p Earnings
per Share FAS
128, Earnings Per Share, requires
dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the
Consolidated Statements of Income. Basic earnings per share exclude dilution
and are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue
common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Diluted earnings
per share include the incremental effect of stock options and restricted stock
units calculated using the treasury stock method. q Fair
Value of Financial Instruments The Company considers the
recorded value of its financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily
of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and
accounts payable, to approximate the fair value of the respective assets and
liabilities at September30, 2004 and 2005. r Stock-Based Compensation The Company currently
accounts for stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with
APB 25, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized
for the granting of stock options to our employees and directors for the years
ended September30, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively, as all stock
options granted under the plan had an exercise price equal to the market value
of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. If stock options
granted during these years had been accounted for based on their fair value as
determined under FAS 123, the pro forma net income and pro forma net income per
share would have been as follows in thousands except per share data 38

The weighted average fair
value of stock options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option pricing calculation with the following assumptions: volatility of 58%
for 2003, 55% for 2004 and 46% for 2005; risk free interest rate of 30% for
2003, 31% for 2004 and 40% for 2005; dividend yield 0%; for 2003 and 2004 and
07% for 2005 and an expected life of the option of 57years in 2003, 54
years in 2004 and 51 years in 2005. The grant-date weighted average fair value
per option of options granted was $1379 in 2003, $1820 in 2004 and $1348 in
2005. s Use
of Estimates The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Significant estimates used by the Company include
estimates of profits or loss on contracts in process, estimates of
collectibility of receivables, evaluation of asset impairment and accrual of
estimated liabilities. 2. Business Combinations No businesses were acquired by the Company in fiscal
2005. At September30, 2005, the Company recorded $13 million as
additional goodwill in connection with an earn-out payment pertaining to a
business acquired in 2002. The earn-out payment was attributable to that
business achieving certain performance objectives. In fiscal 2004, the
Company acquired the businesses described below in business combinations
accounted for as purchases. The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the results of operations of each acquired business since the date of their
respective acquisition. On May3, 2004, the Company acquired substantially all the assets
of TIECorp. for $32 million. In conjunction with the purchase, the Company
recorded intangible assets, primarily non-competition agreements and technology
related intangibles, of $34 million, and other net liabilities of
approximately $02 million, which have been assigned to the Consulting Segment.
Per the terms of the acquisition agreement, additional consideration of up to
$165 million may be paid based on achievement of certain future performance
objectives by TIECorp. This additional consideration will be expensed as
incurred. The TIECorp. business is engaged in the development and marketing of
instructional management software programs and related products and services in
the educational field. The primary reasons for the 39 acquisition were to expand the Companys presence in the educational
software field and to strategically complement the Companys current product
and service offerings in the educational market. On
June1, 2004, the Company acquired certain assets of Manatron,Inc.
for $18 million. In conjunction with the purchase, the Company recorded
goodwill of $15 million and intangible assets, primarily customer contracts
and relationships, of $08 million, and other net liabilities of approximately
$05 million, which have been assigned to the Systems Segment. The acquired
assets relate to the design, development, marketing and support of judicial
software products for county, city and township governments. The primary reason
for the acquisition was to increase the Companys market share in the justice
solutions arena. Following are the
unaudited pro forma results of operations for the Company as if the companies
identified above were acquired at the beginning of the period being reported
in thousands, except per share data

Unbilled accounts
receivable and deferred revenue relate primarily to contracts wherein the
timing of billings to customers varies based on individual contracts and often
differs from the period of revenue recognition. At September30, 2004 and
2005, there was approximately $27 million and $56 million, respectively, billed
but not paid by customers pursuant to contractual retainage provisions. Such
balances are included in billed accounts receivable in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. At September30,
2004 and 2005, approximately $44 million and $53 million of billed long-term
contract receivables, net of reserves of approximately $10 million and $11
million, respectively, are included in other assets. In evaluating the
net realizable value of accounts receivable, the Company considers such factors
as current economic trends, customer credit-worthiness, and changes in the
customer payment terms and collection trends. Changes in the assumptions used
in analyzing a specific account receivable may result in a 40 reserve being recognized
in the period in which the change occurs. Changes in the reserves
against billed accounts receivable were as follows in thousands

During 2005, the Company
wrote off approximately $11 million of fully amortized software development
costs and the related accumulated amortization. Capitalized software
amortization expense for the years ended September30, 2003, 2004 and 2005
was approximately $38 million, $45 million, and $52 million, respectively. 6. Deferred Contract Costs Deferred contract costs
consist of contractually recoverable direct set-up costs relating to long-term
service contracts in progress. These costs include system development and
facility build-out costs totaling $182 million and $290 million at September30,
2004 and 2005, respectively, of which approximately $76 million is leased
equipment at September30, 2004 and 2005. Deferred contract costs are expensed
ratably 41 as services are provided
under the contracts. For the fiscal years ended September30, 2004 and 2005,
accumulated amortization of deferred contract costs was approximately $28
million and $68 million, of which $11 million and $26 million, respectively,
is the accumulated amortization of capital lease assets included in deferred
costs. 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Changes in goodwill for

Intangible assets from
acquisitions are amortized over a period of five to ten years. The
weighted-average amortization periods for non-competition agreements,
technology-based intangibles, and customer contracts and relationships are
approximately five years, six years, and eight years, respectively. The
weighted-average amortization period for total intangible assets is
approximately seven years. The estimated amortization expense for the years
ending September30, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 is $20 million, $20
million, $16 million, $11 million, and $04 million, respectively. 8. Earnings Per Share The following table sets

connection with a long-term contract, the Company issued a standby letter of
credit facility in an initial amount of up to $200 million, which amount was reduced
to $100 million on April1, 2005. The letter of credit, which expires on March31,
2009, may be called by the customer in the event the Company defaults under the
terms of the contract. The facility contains financial covenants that establish
minimum levels of tangible net worth and earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization EBITDA and requires the maintenance of
certain cash balances. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at September30,
2005. 10. Leases The Company leases office
space under various operating leases which typically contain clauses permitting
cancellation upon certain conditions, including the early termination,
non-renewal or material alteration of the related customer contract. The terms
of these leases typically provide for certain minimum payments as well as
increases in lease payments based upon the operating cost of the facility and
the consumer price index. Rent expense for the years ended September30,
2003, 2004 and 2005 was approximately $213 million, $233 million, and $231, respectively. On July15, 2003,
the Company entered into a capital lease financing arrangement with a financial
institution, whereby the Company acquired assets pursuant to an equipment lease
agreement. Rental payments for assets leased are payable over a 60-month period
at a rate of 405% commencing in January2004. On March29, 2004, the
Company entered into a supplemental capital lease financing arrangement with
the same financial institution whereby the Company acquired additional assets
pursuant to an equipment lease agreement. Rental payments for assets leased
under the supplemental arrangement are payable over a 57-month period at a rate
of 361% commencing in April2004. At September30, 2005, capital
lease obligations of approximately $51 million were outstanding related to
these lease arrangements for new equipment. Minimum future payments
under leases in effect as of September30, 2005 are as follows in

We do not provide for
U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, as
we consider these to be permanently reinvested in the operations of such
subsidiaries. If some of these earnings were distributed, some countries may
impose withholding taxes; in addition, as foreign taxes have been previously
paid on these earnings, we would expect to be entitled to a U.S. foreign tax
credit that would reduce the U.S. taxes owed on such distributions. As such, it
is not practical to determine the net amount of the related unrecognized U.S.
deferred tax liability. Cash paid for income
taxes during the years ended September30, 2003, 2004 and 2005 was
approximately $205 million, $102 million, and $94 million respectively. Approximately 90% of the
Companys total goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 13. Shareholders Equity Employee
Stock Purchase Plan Prior to October1,
2005, the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan permitted employees to
purchase shares of the Companys common stock each quarter at 85% of the market
value on the first day of the quarter or the last day of the quarter, whichever
was lower. Effective October1, 2005, the Employee Stock Purchase Plan was
modified to permit employees to purchase shares of the Companys common stock
each quarter at 95% of the market value on the last day of the quarter. During
fiscal 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively, the Company issued approximately 115,300,
71,400 and 76,900 shares of common stock pursuant to this plan at an average
price of $1854, $2840 and $2580 per share. Stock
Repurchase Program Under resolutions adopted in May2000, July2002,
and March2003, the Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase, at
managements discretion, of up to an aggregate of $900 million of the Companys
common stock. In addition, in June2002, the Board of Directors authorized
the use of option exercise proceeds for the repurchase of the Companys common
stock. During the years ended 45 September30, 2004 and 2005, the Company
repurchased 806,800 and 488,404 shares, respectively. At September30, 2005,
approximately $295 million remained available for future stock repurchases
under the program. Stock
Option Plans The Companys Board of
Directors established stock option plans during 1997 pursuant to which the Company
may grant non-qualified stock options to officers, employees and directors of
the Company. Such plans also provide for stock awards and direct purchases of
the Companys common stock. The vesting period and
share price for awards are determined by the Companys Board of Directors at
the date of grant. Options generally vest over a period of four years.
Effective fiscal 2005, options issued expire six years after the date of grant.
Options issued prior to fiscal 2005 expire ten years after date of grant. As of
September30, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors had reserved 66 million
shares of common stock for issuance under the Companys stock option plans. At September30,
2005, approximately 08million shares remained available for grants under
the Companys option plans. The Company issued Restricted Stock Units RSUs to
certain executive officers and employees under its 1997 Equity Incentive Plan Plan.
These RSUs vest ratably over six years with full vesting upon the sixth
anniversary of the date of grant, provided, however, that the vesting will
accelerate if the Company meets certain earnings targets determined by the
Board of Directors. The fair value of the RSUs at the grant date is amortized
to expense over the vesting period. During the fiscal years ended September30,
2003, 2004 and 2005, the Company granted approximately 1,200, 101,300 and
112,550 RSUs at weighted average grant-date fair values of $2217, $3499, and
$3240 per share, respectively. Compensation expense recognized related to
these RSUs was approximately $09 million, $10 million and $14 million for
the fiscal years ended September30, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. A summary of the Companys

14. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation The Company is involved
in various legal proceedings, including contract claims, in the ordinary course
of its business. Management does not expect the ultimate outcome of any of
these legal proceedings or contract claims to have a material adverse effect on
the Companys financial condition or its results of operations. A substantial
portion of payments to the Company from United States government agencies is
subject to adjustments upon audit by the agency with which the Company has
contracted. Audits through 1999 have been completed with no material
adjustments. In the opinion of management, the audits of subsequent years are
not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial
position or results of operations. aIn
the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company learned that two former
employees, who were principals in a small business MAXIMUS acquired in 2000,
had signed fraudulent guarantees on behalf of MAXIMUS for computer equipment
leases. The equipment was leased from Solarcom LLC which, in turn, assigned
certain of the payments under the leases to Fleet Business Credit LLC Fleet
and De Lage Landen Financial Services,Inc. De Lage Landen. The
Company did not have knowledge of the leases or guarantees, and much of the
equipment appears to have been used in businesses unrelated to MAXIMUS.
Solarcom demanded approximately $310 million from MAXIMUS under the
guarantees, which amount represented the remaining payments under the leases. On
August6, 2004, DeLageLanden sued MAXIMUS and Solarcom in the
federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania seeking
recovery of damages, and Solarcom asserted a cross-claim against MAXIMUS.
Solarcom and De Lage Landen subsequently reached an agreement whereby De
Lage Landen dismissed its claims against Solarcom without prejudice and
Solarcom was realigned as a plaintiff in the lawsuit. The amount claimed
by De Lage Landen was part of the approximately $310 million originally
demanded by Solarcom. In
order to avoid the uncertainty of a jury trial and the expense of protracted
litigation, in 47 September2005
the Company settled the claim by De Lage Landen, and the Pennsylvania action
has been dismissed. The confidential settlement was entered into without
admission of fault or liability by the Company. The Solarcom claim
against the Company in the Pennsylvania action was dismissed without prejudice
with the understanding that Solarcom would amend its claim in the ongoing
Georgia action described below to include the damages it originally sought in
the Pennsylvania matter. The Company believes that the settled De Lage
Landen claim represented about 45% of the original $310 million in claims
against the Company arising out of this matter. In
connection with that settlement, MAXIMUS recorded a charge of $70 million for
the fiscal year ended September30, 2005. That amount includes the
settlement amount paid to De Lage Landen and the associated legal expenses for
the fiscal year, as well as a liability for estimated probable future defense
costs of the ongoing Georgia lawsuit. Solarcom
filed suit against MAXIMUS on August17, 2004 in state court in Gwinnett County,
Georgia. On August24, 2004, Fleet sued MAXIMUS and Solarcom in the
federal District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The Solarcom and
Fleet actions were consolidated in the federal District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia on September29, 2004. No date has been set yet
for a trial in the Georgia action. The plaintiffs in the Georgia matter
have asserted damages of approximately $170 million, which includes alleged
late fees and interest on the lease payments. The
Company believes that the circumstances related to the ongoing Georgia lawsuit
are unique and that it is not possible at this time to determine the ultimate
loss that may be incurred, if any. The Georgia suit involves a different
jurisdiction, different party Fleet, different facts including due diligence
activities, and a different procedural posture Solarcom has not been
realigned as a plaintiff in Georgia. Because the guarantees were
fraudulently signed, and because the leasing company did not perform appropriate
due diligence, the Company continues to believe that it is not liable under the
guarantees and will continue to vigorously contest the Georgia matter.
Accordingly, no provision for settlement or unfavorable outcome of the Georgia
lawsuit has been made at this time. The
Company has also reported the matter to law enforcement authorities, and has
filed claims against the former employees. Those claims have been referred to
arbitration for resolution. Although there can be no assurance of a favorable
outcome, the Company does not believe that the remaining claims in Georgia will
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of
operations. bIn October2004, MAXIMUS received a
subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Columbia. The
subpoena requested records pertaining to the Companys work for the District of
Columbia, primarily in the area of assisting in the submission and payment of
federal Medicaid reimbursement claims prepared on behalf of the District of
Columbia. The U.S. Attorneys Office appears to be investigating issues
pertaining to compliance with federal health care laws. MAXIMUS does not
believe it has violated those laws and is cooperating fully with the U.S.
Attorneys Office. Although there can be no assurance of a favorable outcome,
the Company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition or results of operations, and the Company has
not accrued for any loss related to this matter. cIn June2005,
MAXIMUS received a subpoena from the Office of the Attorney General of Illinois
in connection with a purported whistleblower investigation of potential false
claims. The subpoena requested records pertaining to the Companys work for
agencies of the Executive Branch of Illinois State Government. Discussions with
the Attorney Generals office indicate that MAXIMUS was one of nine contractors
that received such subpoenas and that the investigation is primarily focused at
this time on the procurement and contracting activities of the Illinois
Department of Central Management 48 Services. Although
there can be no assurance of a favorable outcome, the Company does not believe
that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition
or results of operations, and the Company has not accrued for any loss related
to this matter. Employment
Agreements The Company has
employment agreements with 11 of its executives and other employees with terms
of the employment obligations ending between 2006 and 2008. 15. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Major Customers Financial instruments
that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit
risk consist primarily of accounts receivable, billed and unbilled, on
uncompleted contracts. To date, these financial instruments have been derived
from contract revenue earned primarily from federal, state and local government
agencies located in the United States. For the years ended September30,
2004 and 2005, the Company derived approximately 14% and 16%, respectively, of
its consolidated revenue from contracts with a single state customer,
principally within our Operations Segment. For fiscal year 2003, there was no
revenue from transactions with a single federal, state or local customer
amounting to 10% or more of the Companys consolidated revenue. 16. Business Segments The following table

1 Certain reclassifications have been made in
the fiscal 2005 quarterly amounts to conform to the current presentation of
legal settlement expense. 18. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On
December16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of FASB Statement No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Statement 123R supersedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No95,
Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the
approach in Statement 123R is similar to the approach described in Statement
123. However, Statement 123R requires all share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income
statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosures are no longer an
alternative. Statement
123R must be adopted no later than October1, 2005 for September30,
2005 year end companies. Early adoption will be permitted in periods in which
financial statements have not yet been issued. We expect to adopt Statement
123R on October1, 2005. Statement 123R permits public companies to
adopt its requirements using one of two methods 1. A modified prospective method in which
compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date abased
on the requirements of Statement 123R for all share-based payments granted
after the effective date; and bbased on the requirements of Statement 123
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of Statement
123R that remain unvested on the effective date. 52 2. A modified retrospective method which includes
the requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also
permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under
Statement 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures for all prior periods
presented. The
Company plans to use the modified prospective method to adopt the requirements
of Statement 123R. As
permitted by Statement 123, the Company currently accounts for share-based
payments to employees using APB Opinion No25s intrinsic value method
and, as such, recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options.
Accordingly, the adoption of Statement 123Rs fair value method will have an
impact on our results of operations, although it will have no impact on our
overall financial position. The impact of adoption of Statement 123R will
depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the future; however, the
Company expects the impact of adoption to be approximately $004 per diluted
share for the quarter ended December31, 2005. Had we adopted Statement
123R in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated
the impact of Statement 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net
income and earnings per share under Stock-Based Compensation
in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. Statement
123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized
compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an
operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will
reduce the amount we report as net operating cash flows and increase the amount
we report as net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While the
Company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they
depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options, the
amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax
deductions were $18 million, $39 million and $30 million for the fiscal
years ended September30, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. 53 Item 1.

Item 5. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule13a-15eunder
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act as of the end of the
period covered by this Annual Report on Form10-K. Based on this
evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective and
designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the requisite time periods. Managements
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as defined in Rule13a-15funder the Exchange Act. Our internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of
published financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of September30, 2005. In making this assessment, management used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that as of
September30, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting was
effective based on criteria set forth by COSO in Internal
Control Integrated Framework. Managements
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as
of September30, 2005, has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, the
independent registered public accounting firm who also audited our consolidated
financial statements. Ernst Youngs attestation report on managements
assessment of our internal control over financial reporting is included following
this Item 9A. Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There was no change in our internal control
over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15fand 15d-15funder
the Exchange Act identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal
control that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter of 2005 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. 54 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The
Board of Directors
MAXIMUS,Inc. We
have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that MAXIMUS,Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September30,
2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
the COSO criteria. MAXIMUS,Inc.s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion. A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In
our opinion, managements assessment that MAXIMUS,Inc. maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of September30,
2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.
Also, in our opinion, MAXIMUS,Inc. maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of September30,
2005, based on the COSO criteria. We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of MAXIMUS,Inc.
as of September30, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements
of income, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended September30, 2005 of MAXIMUS,Inc. and our
report dated November22, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
