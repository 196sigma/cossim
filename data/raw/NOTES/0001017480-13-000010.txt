Hibbett Sports, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hibbett Sports, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' investment, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended February 2, 2013. We also have audited Hibbett Sports, Inc. internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Hibbett Sports, Inc. management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on Hibbett Sports, Inc. internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Hibbett Sports, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended February 2, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Hibbett Sports, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. s/ KPMG LLP

AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business Hibbett Sports, Inc. is an operator of sporting goods retail stores in small to mid-sized markets predominately in the South, Southwest, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the United States. References to we, our, us and the Company refer to Hibbett Sports, Inc. and its subsidiaries as well as its predecessors. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31 of each year. The consolidated statement of operations for Fiscal 2013 includes 53 weeks of operations while our consolidated statements of operations for Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 include 52 weeks of operations. Our merchandise assortment features a core selection of brand name merchandise emphasizing athletic footwear, team sports equipment, athletic and fashion apparel and related accessories. We complement this core assortment with a selection of localized apparel, footwear and accessories designed to appeal to a wide range of customers within each market. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of our Company include its accounts and the accounts of all wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Occasionally, certain reclassifications are made to conform previously reported data to the current presentation. Such reclassifications had no impact on total assets, net income or stockholders' investment in any of the years presented. Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, including inventories and property and equipment the reported amounts of certain liabilities, including legal and other accruals; and the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The assumptions used by management could change significantly in future estimates due to changes in circumstances and actual results could differ from those estimates. Reportable Segments Given the economic characteristics of the store formats, the similar nature of products offered for sale, the type of customers, the methods of distribution and how our Company is managed, our operations constitute only one reportable segment. Revenues from external customers by product category are impractical for us to report. Customers No customer accounted for more than 50% of our net sales during the fiscal years ended February 2, 2013, January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011. Vendor Arrangements We enter into arrangements with some of our vendors that entitle us to a partial refund of the cost of merchandise purchased during the year or reimbursement of certain costs we incur to advertise or otherwise promote their product. The volume-based rebates, supported by vendor agreements, are estimated throughout the year and reduce the cost of inventories and cost of goods sold during the year. This estimate is regularly monitored and adjusted for current or anticipated changes in purchase levels and for sales activity. 43 We also receive consideration from vendors through a variety of other programs, including markdown reimbursements, vendor compliance charges and defective merchandise credits. If the payment is a reimbursement for costs incurred, it is recognized as an offset against those related costs; otherwise, it is treated as a reduction to the cost of merchandise. Markdown reimbursements related to merchandise that has been sold are negotiated by our merchandising teams and are credited directly to cost of goods sold in the period received. If vendor funds are received prior to merchandise being sold, they are recorded as a reduction of merchandise cost. Vendor compliance charges and defective merchandise credits reduce the cost of inventories. Advertising We expense advertising costs when incurred. We participate in various advertising and marketing cooperative programs with our vendors, who, under these programs, reimburse us for certain costs incurred. A receivable for cooperative advertising to be reimbursed is recorded as a decrease to expense as advertisements are run. The following table presents the components of our advertising expense in thousands Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2013 January 28, 2012 January 29, 2011 Gross advertising costs 9,554 8,329 7,314 Advertising reimbursements 4,002 3,748 3,389 Net advertising costs 5,552 4,581 3,925 Cost of Goods Sold We include inbound freight charges, merchandise purchases, store occupancy costs and a portion of our distribution costs related to our retail business in cost of goods sold. Costs associated with moving merchandise to and between stores are included in store operating, selling and administrative expenses. Stock Repurchase Program In November 2012, the Board of Directors Board authorized a Stock Repurchase Program 2012 Program of $2500 million to repurchase our common stock through January 29, 2016. The 2012 Program replaced our existing plan that was adopted in November 2009 2009 Program. Stock repurchases may be made in the open market or in negotiated transactions, with the amount and timing of repurchases dependent on market conditions and at the discretion of our management. Under both the 2012 Program and 2009 Program, we repurchased 09 million shares of our common stock during Fiscal 2013 at a cost of $499 million, including 01 million shares acquired from holders of restricted stock unit awards to satisfy tax withholding requirements of $39 million. We repurchased 19 million shares of our common stock during Fiscal 2012 at a cost of $686 million, including shares acquired from holders of restricted stock unit awards to satisfy tax withholding requirements of $11 million. Under the original authorization adopted in August 2004, we had repurchased 78 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $1669 million. Under all authorizations, we had repurchased a total of 120 million shares of our common stock at an approximate cost of $3233 million as of February 2, 2013, and had approximately $2454 million remaining under the 2012 Program for stock repurchase. Shares acquired from holders of restricted stock unit awards to satisfy tax withholding requirements do not reduce the authorization. 44 Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less, including commercial paper and money market funds, to be cash equivalents. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by our financial institutions where we maintain deposits to the extent the amount recorded on the consolidated balance sheet exceeds the FDIC insurance limits per institution. Amounts due from third-party credit card processors for the settlement of debit and credit card transactions are included as cash equivalents as they are generally collected within three business days. Cash equivalents related to credit and debit card transactions at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012 were $36 million and $30 million, respectively. Investments We hold investments in trust for the Hibbett Sports, Inc. Supplemental 401k Plan Supplemental Plan and the Hibbett Sports, Inc. Executive Voluntary Deferral Plan Deferral Plan. These are trading securities and are classified as long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are included in other assets, net. At February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, we had $19 million and $14 million, respectively, of investments included in other assets, net. Net unrealized holding gains for both Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012 were $01 million. Trade and Other Accounts Receivable Trade accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from sales to educational institutions for athletic programs. We do not require collateral, and we maintain an allowance for potential uncollectible accounts based on an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements, historical losses and existing economic conditions, when relevant. The allowance for doubtful accounts at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012 was $42,000 and $49,000, respectively. Other accounts receivable consists primarily of tenant allowances due from landlords and cooperative advertising due from vendors. We analyze other accounts receivable for collectability based on aging of individual components, underlying contractual terms and economic conditions. Recorded amounts are deemed to be collectible. Inventory Valuation Inventories are valued using the lower of weighted average cost or market method. Items are removed from inventory using the weighted average cost method. Lower of Cost or Market: Market is determined based on estimated net realizable value. We regularly review inventories to determine if the carrying value exceeds realizable value, and we record an accrual to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value as necessary. We account for obsolescence as part of our lower of cost or market accrual based on historical trends and specific identification. As of February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, the accrual was $23 million and $19 million, respectively. A determination of net realizable value requires significant judgment and estimates. Shrinkage: We accrue for inventory shrinkage based on the actual historical results of physical inventories. These estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are performed and reconciled to the general ledger. Store counts are typically performed on a cyclical basis and the distribution center counts are performed quarterly. As of February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, the accrual was $15 million and $16 million, respectively. Inventory Purchase Concentration: Our business is dependent to a significant degree upon close relationships with our vendors. Our largest vendor, Nike, represented 489%, 483% and 478% of our purchases in Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, respectively. Our next largest vendor in Fiscal 2013 represented 128%, 93% and 81% of our purchases in Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, respectively. Our third largest vendor in Fiscal 2013 represented 109%, 114% and 83% of our purchases in Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, respectively. 45 Consignment Inventories: Consignment inventories, which are owned by the vendor but located in our stores, are not reported as our inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined. At February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, vendor-owned inventories held at our locations and not reported as our inventory were $16 million and $13 million, respectively. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost and include assets acquired through capital leases. Depreciation on assets is principally provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated service lives Buildings 39 years Leasehold improvements 3 10 years Furniture and fixtures 7 years Equipment 3 5 years In the case of leasehold improvements, we calculate depreciation using the shorter of the initial term of the underlying leases or the estimated economic lives of the improvements. The term of the lease includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty. We continually reassess the remaining useful life of leasehold improvements in light of store closing plans. Construction in progress has historically been comprised primarily of property and equipment related to unopened stores and costs associated with technology upgrades at period-end. At February 2, 2013, approximately 66% of the construction in progress balance was comprised of costs associated with our new corporate headquarters and wholesaling and logistics facility. Information technology costs accounted for approximately 32% and unopened stores accounted for approximately 2% of the construction in progress balance on February 2, 2013. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold, retired or otherwise disposed of are removed from property and equipment and the related gain or loss is credited or charged to net income. Deferred Rent Deferred rent primarily consists of step rent and allowances from landlords related to our leased properties. Step rent represents the difference between actual operating lease payments due and straight-line rent expense, which we record over the term of the lease, including the build-out period. This amount is recorded as deferred rent in the early years of the lease, when cash payments are generally lower than straight-line rent expense, and reduced in the later years of the lease when payments begin to exceed the straight-line rent expense. Landlord allowances are generally comprised of amounts received and/or promised to us by landlords and may be received in the form of cash or free rent. We record a receivable from the landlord in accordance with the terms of the lease and a deferred rent liability. This deferred rent is amortized into net income through lower rent expense over the term including the pre-opening build-out period of the applicable lease, and the receivable is reduced as amounts are received from the landlord. In our consolidated statements of cash flows, the current and long-term portions of landlord allowances are included as changes in cash flows from operations. The current portion is included as a change in accrued expenses and the long-term portion is included as a change in deferred rent, non-current. The liability for the current portion of unamortized landlord allowances was $29 million and $31 million at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively. The liability for the long-term portion of unamortized landlord allowances was $88 million and $82 million at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively. We estimate the non-cash portion of landlord allowances was $11 million and $09 million in Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012, respectively. 46 Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue, including gift card and layaway sales, in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Retail merchandise sales occur on-site in our retail stores. Customers have the option of paying the full purchase price of the merchandise upon sale or paying a down payment and placing the merchandise on layaway. The customer may make further payments in installments, but the entire purchase price for merchandise placed on layaway must be received by us within 30 days. The down payment and any installments are recorded by us as short-term deferred revenue until the customer pays the entire purchase price for the merchandise. We recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. Retail sales are recorded net of returns and discounts and exclude sales taxes. We offer a customer loyalty program, the MVP Rewards program, whereby customers, upon registration, can earn points in a variety of ways, including store purchases, website surveys and other activities on our website. Based on the number of points accumulated, customers receive reward certificates on a quarterly basis that can be redeemed in our stores. An estimate of the obligation related to the program, based on historical redemption rates, is recorded as a current liability and a reduction of net retail sales in the period earned by the customer. The current liability is reduced, and a corresponding amount is recognized in net retail sales, in the amount of and at the time of redemption of the reward certificate. At February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, the amount recorded in current liabilities for reward certificates issued was inconsequential. The cost of coupon sales incentives is recognized at the time the related revenue is recognized by us. Proceeds received from the issuance of gift cards are initially recorded as deferred revenue. Revenue is subsequently recognized at the time the customer redeems the gift cards and takes possession of the merchandise. Unredeemed gift cards are recorded as a current liability. Gift card breakage revenue is recognized to the extent not required to be remitted to jurisdictions as unclaimed property and is based upon historical redemption patterns and represents the balance of gift cards for which we believe the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote. Based on our analyses of redemption activity, we have determined the likelihood of redemption for gift cards 5 years after the date of initial issuance is remote. For Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, $03 million, $02 million and $02 million of breakage revenue, respectively, was recorded in net income as other income and is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as a reduction to store operating, selling and administrative expense. The net deferred revenue liability at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012 was $39 million and $35 million, respectively. Store Opening and Closing Costs New store opening costs, including pre-opening costs, are charged to expense as incurred. Store opening costs primarily include payroll expenses, training costs and straight-line rent expenses. All pre-opening costs are included in store operating, selling and administrative expenses as a part of operating expenses. We consider individual store closings to be a normal part of operations and regularly review store performance against expectations. Costs associated with store closings are recognized at the time of closing or when a liability has been incurred. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of long-lived assets may be impaired and not recoverable. Our policy is to recognize any impairment loss on long-lived assets as a charge to current income when certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment is assessed considering the estimated undiscounted cash flows over the asset remaining life. If estimated cash flows are insufficient to recover the investment, an impairment loss is recognized based on a comparison of the cost of the asset to fair value less any costs of disposition. Evaluation of asset impairment requires significant judgment and estimates. 47 Insurance Accrual We are self-insured for a significant portion of our health insurance. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are estimated, in part, by considering our historical claims experience. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be affected if future occurrences and claims differ from our assumptions. To minimize our potential exposure, we carry stop-loss insurance that reimburses us for losses over $02 million per covered person per year, limited to a lifetime maximum reimbursement of $20 million per covered person. As of February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, the accrual for these liabilities was $07 million and $08 million, respectively, and was included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. We are also self-insured for our workers' compensation, property and general liability insurance up to an established deductible with a cumulative stop-loss on workers' compensation. As of February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, the accrual for these liabilities which is not discounted was $02 million and $04 million, respectively, and was included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. Sales Returns Net sales returns were $288 million for Fiscal 2013, $257 million for Fiscal 2012 and $232 million for Fiscal 2011. The accrual for the effect of estimated returns on pre-tax income was $04 million as of February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, and was included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. Determination of the accrual for estimated returns requires significant judgment and estimates. NOTE 2. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS We continuously monitor and review all current accounting pronouncements and standards from the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB and other authoritative sources of U.S. GAAP for applicability to our operations. Proposed Amendments to Current Accounting Standards. The FASB is currently working on amendments to existing accounting standards governing a number of areas including, but not limited to, accounting for leases. In August 2010, the FASB issued an exposure draft, Leases, which would replace the existing guidance in ASC Topic 840, Leases. When and if effective, this proposed standard will likely have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, as the standard-setting process is still ongoing, we are unable to determine the impact this proposed change in accounting will have on the consolidated financial statements at this time. NOTE 3. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION At February 2, 2013, we had four stock-based compensation plans a
The Amended 2005 Equity Incentive Plan EIP provides that the Board of Directors may grant equity awards to certain employees of the Company at its discretion. The EIP was adopted effective July 1, 2005 and authorizes grants of equity awards of up to 1,983,159 authorized but unissued shares of common stock. At February 2, 2013, there were 781,459 shares available for grant under the EIP. b
The Amended 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP allows for qualified employees to participate in the purchase of up to 204,794 shares of our common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the closing price at the beginning or end of each quarterly stock purchase period. The ESPP was adopted effective July 1, 2005. At February 2, 2013, there were 85,319 shares available for purchase under the ESPP. c
The Amended 2005 Director Deferred Compensation Plan Deferred Plan allows non-employee directors an election to defer all or a portion of their fees into stock units or stock options. The Deferred Plan was adopted effective July 1, 2005 and authorizes grants of stock up to 112,500 authorized but unissued shares of common stock. At February 2, 2013, there were 54,003 shares available for grant under the Deferred Plan. 48 d
The 2012 Non-Employee Director Equity Plan DEP provides for grants of equity awards to non-employee directors. The DEP was adopted effective May 24, 2012 and authorizes grants of equity awards of up to 500,000 authorized but unissued shares of common stock. At February 2, 2013, there were 498,725 shares available for grant under the DEP. Prior to the adoption of the DEP by our stockholders, non-employee director awards were given under the Amended 2006 Non-Employee Director Equity Plan NEDEP which also provided for grants of equity awards to non-employee directors. The NEDEP was superseded by the DEP. Our plans allow for a variety of equity awards including stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights and performance awards. As of February 2, 2013, we had only granted awards in the form of stock options, restricted stock units RSUs and performance-based units PSUs to our employees. The annual grant made for Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 to employees consisted solely of RSUs. We have also awarded PSUs to our Named Executive Officers NEOs and expect the Compensation Committee of the Board will continue to grant PSUs to our NEOs in the future. As of February 2, 2013, we had only granted awards in the form of stock options to our Board members, with the exception of one RSU award to our newest director upon appointment to the Board under the DEP. Under the DEP, Board members currently receive a value of $75,000 worth of equity in the form of stock options or restricted stock units upon election to the Board and a value of $100,000 worth of equity in any form allowed within the DEP, for each full year of service, pro-rated for Directors who serve less than one full year. The terms and vesting schedules for stock-based awards vary by type of grant and generally vest upon time-based conditions. Under the DEP, Directors have the option with certain equity forms to set vest dates. Upon exercise, stock-based compensation awards are settled with authorized but unissued company stock. All of our awards are classified as equity awards. The compensation cost for these plans was as follows in thousands Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2013 January 28, 2012 January 29, 2011 Stock-based compensation expense by type Stock options 805 460 792 Restricted stock units 4,715 4,857 3,937 Employee stock purchases 93 76 67 Director deferred compensation 36 60 Total stock-based compensation expense 5,649 5,453 4,796 Income tax benefit recognized 2,082 1,987 1,666 Stock-based compensation expense, net of income tax 3,567 3,466 3,130 Stock-based and deferred stock compensation expenses are included in store operating, selling and administrative expenses. There is no capitalized stock-based compensation cost. The income tax benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements, as disclosed above, is based on the amount of compensation expense recorded for book purposes. The actual income tax benefit realized in our income tax return is based on the intrinsic value, or the excess of the market value over the exercise or purchase price, of stock options exercised and restricted stock unit awards vested during the period. The actual income tax benefit realized for the deductions considered on our income tax returns for Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 was from option exercises and restricted stock unit releases and totaled $59 million, $32 million and $45 million, respectively. 49 Stock Options Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. Vesting and expiration provisions vary between equity plans, but options granted awarded to employees under the EIP typically vest over a four or five-year period in equal installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and typically expire on the eighth or tenth anniversary of the date of grant. Grants awarded to outside directors under the DEP, NEDEP and Deferred Plan vest immediately upon grant and expire on the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. Following is the weighted average fair value of each option granted during Fiscal 2013. The fair value was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for each period Quarter Ended April 28, 2012 July 28, 2012 October 27, 2012 February 2, 2013 Grant date Mar 13 Mar 31 Jun 30 Sep 30 Dec 31 Exercise price 5203 5455 5771 5945 5270 Weighted average fair value at date of grant 1929 1988 2124 2062 1814 Expected option life years 475 475 475 471 471 Expected volatility 4245 4154 4259 4026 3973 Risk-free interest rate 094 098 069 058 067 Dividend yield None None None None None We calculate the expected term for our stock options based on the historical exercise behavior of our participants. Historically, an increase in our stock price has led to a pattern of earlier exercise by participants. Typically, grants made to our Directors have a contractual term of 10 years, while grants made to our employees have a contractual term of 8 years. We have not awarded a stock option grant to employees since 2009. With the absence of option grants to employees, we anticipate the expected term will remain relatively stable. The volatility used to value stock options is based on historical volatility. We calculate historical volatility using an average calculation methodology based on daily price intervals as measured over the expected term of the option. We have consistently applied this methodology since our adoption of the original disclosure provisions of ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation. In accordance with ASC Topic 718, we base the risk-free interest rate on the annual continuously compounded risk-free rate with a term equal to the option expected term. The dividend yield is assumed to be zero since we have no current plan to declare dividends. Activity for our option plans during Fiscal 2013 was as follows Number of

The compensation expense included in store operating, selling and administrative expenses and recognized during Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 was $08 million, $04 million and $08 million, respectively, before the recognized income tax benefit of $03 million, $02 million and $02 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 was $40 million, $53 million and $113 million, respectively. The total cash received from these stock option exercises during Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 was $27 million, $49 million and $91 million, respectively. Excess income tax proceeds from stock option exercises are included in cash flows from financing activities as required by ASC Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows. As of February 2, 2013, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options. Restricted Stock and Performance-Based Units RSUs and PSUs are granted with a fair value equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. All PSUs have been awarded in the form of restricted stock units. Compensation expense is recorded straight-line over the vesting period and, in the case of PSUs, at the estimated percent of achievement. Restricted stock unit awards to our employees generally cliff vest in four years from the date of grant for those awards that are not performance-based. If a Director chooses an RSU as the form to receive their annual equity award, he or she sets the vesting period. PSUs provide for awards based on achievement of certain predetermined corporate performance goals and cliff vest in one to five years from the date of grant after achievement of stated performance criterion and upon meeting stated service conditions.

The weighted average grant date fair value of our RSUs granted was $5226, $3131 and $2586 for Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, respectively. There were 104,417, 156,143 and 193,421 RSUs awarded during Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, respectively. The compensation expense included in store operating, selling and administrative expenses and recognized during Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 was $47 million, $49 million and $39 million, respectively, before the recognized income tax benefit of $18 million, $18 million and $14 million, respectively. During Fiscal 2013, RSU awards of 220,076 unit awards, including 89,575 awards that were PSUs, vested with an intrinsic value of $118 million. The total intrinsic value of our RSU awards outstanding and unvested at February 2, 2013, January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011 was $343 million, $369 million and $221 million, respectively. As of February 2, 2013, there was approximately $63 million of total unamortized unrecognized compensation cost related to RSU awards. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 20 years. 51 Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company ESPP allows eligible employees the right to purchase shares of our common stock, subject to certain limitations, at 85% of the lesser of the market value at the end of each calendar quarter purchase date or the beginning of each calendar quarter. Our employee purchases of common stock and the average price per share through the ESPP were as follows Fiscal Year Ended Shares

The compensation expense included in store operating, selling and administrative expenses and recognized during each of Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 was $01 million. Director Deferred Compensation Under the Deferred Plan, non-employee directors can elect to defer all or a portion of their Board and Board Committee fees into cash, stock options or deferred stock units. Those fees deferred into stock options are subject to the same provisions as provided for in the DEP and are expensed and accounted for accordingly. Director fees deferred into our common stock are calculated and expensed each calendar quarter by taking total fees earned during the calendar quarter and dividing by the closing price on the last day of the calendar quarter, rounded to the nearest whole share. The total annual retainer, Board and Board Committee fees for non-employee directors that are not deferred into stock options, but which includes amounts deferred into stock units under the Deferred Plan, are expensed as incurred in all periods presented. A total of 646 and 1,561 stock units were deferred under this plan in Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012, respectively. No stock units were deferred under this plan in Fiscal 2011. One director has elected to defer compensation into stock units in calendar 2013. The compensation expense included in store operating, selling and administrative expenses and recognized during Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012 was $36,000 and $60,000, respectively, before the recognized income tax benefit of $14,000 and $22,000, respectively. There was no compensation expense related to director deferred compensation included in store operating, selling and administrative expenses during Fiscal 2011. 52 NOTE 4. EARNINGS PER SHARE The computation of basic earnings per share EPS is based on the number of weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted EPS is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus the incremental shares that would be outstanding assuming exercise of dilutive stock options and issuance of restricted stock. The number of incremental shares is calculated by applying the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share in thousands Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2013 January 28, 2012 January 29, 2011 Net income 72,582 59,060 46,400 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding 26,132 26,978 28,426 Dilutive stock options 372 177 264 Dilutive restricted stock units 134 351 343 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive shares 26,638 27,506 29,033 Basic earnings per share 278 219 163 Diluted earnings per share 272 215 160 In calculating diluted earnings per share for Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, there were no options to purchase shares of common stock outstanding as of the end of the period that were excluded in the computations of diluted earnings per share due to their anti-dilutive effect. We excluded 42,700 nonvested stock awards granted to certain employees from the computation of diluted weighted average common shares and common share equivalents outstanding, because they are subject to performance-based annual vesting conditions which had not been achieved by the end of Fiscal 2013. Assuming the performance criteria had been achieved at target as of February 2, 2013, the incremental dilutive impact would have been 20,541 shares. NOTE 5. DEBT At February 2, 2013, we had two unsecured credit facilities, which are renewable in August and November 2013. The August facility allows for borrowings up to $300 million at a rate equal to the higher of prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 05% or LIBOR. The November facility allows for borrowings up to $500 million at a rate of prime plus 2%. Under the provisions of both facilities, we do not pay commitment fees and are not subject to covenant requirements. We did not have any borrowings against either of these facilities during Fiscal 2013, nor was there any debt outstanding under either of these facilities at February 2, 2013. At February 2, 2013, a total of $800 million was available to us from these facilities. At January 28, 2012, we had two unsecured credit facilities, which were renewable in August and November 2012. The August facility allowed for borrowings up to $300 million at a rate equal to the higher of prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 05% or LIBOR. The November facility allowed for borrowings up to $500 million at a rate of prime plus 2%. Under the provisions of both facilities, we did not pay commitment fees and were not subject to covenant requirements. We did not have any borrowings against either of these facilities during Fiscal 2012, nor was there any debt outstanding under either of these facilities at January 28, 2012. 53 NOTE 6. LEASES We have entered into capital leases for certain property and transportation equipment. At February 2, 2013, the total capital lease obligation was $28 million, of which $07 million was classified as a short-term liability and included in capital lease obligations and $21 million was classified as a long-term liability as obligations under capital leases in our consolidated balance sheet. At January 28, 2012, the total capital lease obligation was $22 million, of which $02 million was classified as a short-term liability and included in capital lease obligations and $20 million was classified as a long-term liability as obligations under capital leases in our consolidated balance sheet. The cost basis of total assets under capital leases at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012 was $32 million and $24 million, respectively, with accumulated amortization at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012 of $05 million and $03 million, respectively. Amortization expense related to assets under capital leases was $02 million, $03 million and $02 million in Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, respectively. We lease the majority of our retail sporting goods stores under non-cancelable operating leases. The leases typically provide for terms of five to ten years with options to extend at our discretion. Many of our leases contain scheduled increases in annual rent payments and the majority of our leases also require us to pay maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes. Additionally, many of the lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances, rent holidays and/or rent escalation clauses contingent rentals based on net sales for the location. For purposes of recognizing incentives and minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, we use the date of initial possession to begin amortization, which is generally when we enter the space and begin to make improvements in preparation of our intended use. Most of our retail store leases contain provisions that allow for early termination of the lease if certain pre-determined annual sales levels are not met. Generally, these provisions allow the lease to be terminated between the third and fifth year of the lease. Should the lease be terminated under these provisions, in some cases, the unamortized portion of any landlord allowances related to that property would be payable to the landlord. We also lease certain office equipment and transportation equipment under non-cancelable operating leases having initial terms of more than one year. In February 1996, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction to finance our distribution center and office facilities. In December 1999, the related operating lease was amended to include the Fiscal 2000 expansion of these facilities. The amended lease rate is $09 million per year and can increase annually with the Consumer Price Index. This lease will expire in December 2014. Future minimum lease payments under this non-cancelable lease aggregate approximately $19 million. The transaction is also subject to quarterly financial covenants based on certain ratios. During Fiscal 2013, we increased our lease commitments by a net of 41 retail stores, each having initial lease termination dates between April 2017 and May 2023 as well as various office and transportation equipment. At February 2, 2013, the future minimum lease payments under capital leases and the present value of such payments, and the future minimum lease payments under our operating leases, excluding maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes, including the net 41 operating leases added during Fiscal 2013, were as follows in thousands Capital Operating Total Fiscal 2014 874 47,549 48,423 Fiscal 2015 372 38,902 39,274 Fiscal 2016 375 28,318 28,693 Fiscal 2017 385 20,703 21,088 Fiscal 2018 385 14,160 14,545 Thereafter 1,206 23,272 24,478 Total minimum lease payments 3,597 172,904 176,501 Less amount representing interest 745 745 Present value of total minimum lease payments 2,852 172,904 175,756 54 Rental expense for all operating leases consisted of the following in thousands Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2013 January 28, 2012 January 29, 2011 Minimum rentals 40,075 37,971 36,294 Contingent rentals 6,331 5,767 5,220 46,406 43,738 41,514 NOTE 7. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION BENEFIT PLANS We maintain the Hibbett Sports, Inc. 401k Plan 401k Plan for the benefit of our employees. The 401k Plan covers all employees who have completed one year of service, worked 1,000 hours and who are at least 18 years of age. Participants of the 401k Plan may voluntarily contribute from 1% to 100% of their compensation subject to certain yearly dollar limitations as allowed by law. These elective contributions are made under the provisions of Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code which allows deferral of income taxes on the amount contributed to the 401k Plan. The Company contribution to the 401k Plan equals 1 an amount determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors plus 2 a matching contribution equal to a discretionary percentage of up to 60% of a participant compensation. For Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, we matched $075 for each dollar of compensation deferred by the employees up to 60% of compensation. Contribution expense incurred under the 401k Plan for Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 was $08 million, $08 million and $06 million, respectively. We maintain the Hibbett Sports, Inc. Supplemental 401k Plan Supplemental Plan for the purpose of supplementing the employer matching contribution and salary deferral opportunity available to highly compensated employees whose ability to receive Company matching contributions and defer salary under our existing 401k Plan has been limited because of certain restrictions applicable to qualified plans. The non-qualified deferred compensation Supplemental Plan allows participants to defer up to 40% of their compensation and receive an employer matching contribution equal to $075 for each dollar of compensation deferred, subject to a maximum of 45% of compensation and subject to Board discretion. The matching contribution for Fiscal 2014 has been set by the Board to equal no more than $075 for each dollar of compensation deferred under both the 401k Plan and the Supplemental Plan up to 60% of compensation. Contribution expense incurred under the Supplemental Plan for Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 was $01 million, $02 million and $01 million, respectively. The Supplemental Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We maintain the Hibbett Sports, Inc. Executive Voluntary Deferral Plan Voluntary Plan that provides key executives of the Company an opportunity to defer, on a pre-tax basis, up to 50% of their base salary and up to 100% of any bonus earned. Participants, at election, determine the date payout is to be made with payout options as either a lump-sum payout or installment payments over 2 to 10 years. The Voluntary Plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA and was effective February 1, 2010 and is also intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We maintain a Flexible Spending Account Plan FSA that allows employees to set aside pre-tax amounts for out-of-pocket health care and dependent care expenses. The health care FSA is subject to ERISA, whereas the dependent care FSA is not. Employees are eligible to participate in the FSA upon meeting eligibility requirements or upon a defined qualifying event, and may enroll annually during an open enrollment period. Plan amounts are determined annually by the employee in advance and are subject to IRS dollar limitations. Employee elections, in general, cannot be increased, decreased or discontinued during the election period. Unused amounts at the end of the plan year are subject to forfeiture and such forfeitures can be used to offset administrative expenses. 55 NOTE 8. RELATEDPARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company leases one store under a lease arrangement with AL Florence Realty Holdings 2010, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Books-A-Million, Inc., BAMM. One of our Directors, Terrance G. Finley is an executive officer and stockholder of BAMM and another Director, Albert C. Johnson, is a Director and stockholder of BAMM. Minimum annual lease payments are $01 million, if not in co-tenancy and the lease termination date is June 2013. In Fiscal 2012, there were no minimum annual lease payments.

The components of the deferred income taxes, net, are as follows in thousands February 2, 2013 January 28, 2012 Current Non-current Current Non-current Deferred rent 1,406 4,834 1,458 4,664 Inventories 4,439 3,994 Accruals 2,980 1,672 2,593 1,433 Stock-based compensation 1,308 4,148 989 4,125 Other 17 1 20 2 Total deferred tax assets 10,150 10,655 9,054 10,224 Accumulated depreciation and amortization 6,414 6,682 Prepaid expenses 901 805 Accruals 58 72 State taxes 423 156 375 126 Total deferred tax liabilities 1,382 6,570 1,252 6,808 Deferred income taxes, net 8,768 4,085 7,802 3,416 Deferred tax assets represent items that will be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns or are items of income that have not been recognized for financial statement purposes but were included in the current or prior tax returns for which we have already properly recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets balance will be recovered. We take into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of a realization of a deferred tax asset. To the extent recovery is not more likely than not, a valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the year such determination is made. We have determined that no such allowance is required. We apply the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-10 in accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. In accordance with ASC Subtopic 740-10, we recognize a tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. Our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified. Our effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal and various state jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have recorded a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and finally resolved. Generally, we are not subject to changes in income taxes by the U.S. federal taxing jurisdiction for years prior to Fiscal 2010 or by most state taxing jurisdictions for years prior to Fiscal 2009. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate. Favorable settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit could be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. Unfavorable settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the period of resolution. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as non-current. However, if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position, the liability is presented as current. 57 A reconciliation of the unrecognized tax benefit under ASC Topic 740 follows in thousands Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2013 January 28, 2012 January 29, 2011 Unrecognized tax benefits - beginning of year 2,604 3,887 2,351 Gross increases - tax positions in prior period 55 31 264 Gross decreases - tax positions in prior period 42 1,412 Gross increases - tax positions in current period 278 496 2,191 Settlements 230 Lapse of statute of limitations 187 168 919 Unrecognized tax benefits - end of year 2,708 2,604 3,887 We classify interest and penalties recognized on unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. We have accrued interest and penalties in the amount of $03 million as of February 2, 2013, January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011. During Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, we recorded $01 million in each year for the accrual of interest and penalties in the consolidated statement of operations. Of the unrecognized tax benefits as of February 2, 2013, January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, $11 million, $11 million and $12 million, respectively, if recognized, would affect our effective income tax rate. NOTE 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Annual Bonuses and Equity Incentive Awards Specified officers and corporate employees of our Company are entitled to annual bonuses, primarily based on measures of Company operating performance. At February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, there was $43 million and $42 million, respectively, of annual bonus-related expense included in accrued expenses. In addition, the Compensation Committee Committee of the Board of Directors places performance criteria on awards of PSUs made in the form of RSUs to our NEOs under the EIP. The performance criteria are tied to performance targets with respect to future sales and operating income over a specified period of time. These PSUs are expensed under the provisions of ASC Topic 718 and are evaluated each quarter to determine the probability that the performance conditions set within will be met. We expect the Committee to continue to place performance criteria on awards of RSUs to our NEOs in the future. Legal Proceedings and Other Contingencies We are a party to various legal proceedings incidental to our business. We do not believe that any of these matters will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on our business or financial condition. We cannot give assurance, however, that one or more of these lawsuits will not have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which they are resolved. It is reasonably possible that losses in addition to the amount accrued could be incurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters or make an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss based on the information currently available to the Company. At February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, we estimated that the liability related to these matters was approximately $03 million and accordingly, we accrued $03 million as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheets. The estimates of our liability for pending and unasserted potential claims do not include litigation costs. It is our policy to accrue legal fees when it is probable that we will have to defend against known claims or allegations and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the anticipated expense. 58 From time to time, we enter into certain types of agreements that require us to indemnify parties against third-party claims under certain circumstances. Generally, these agreements relate to: a agreements with vendors and suppliers under which we may provide customary indemnification to our vendors and suppliers in respect to actions they take at our request or otherwise on our behalf; b agreements to indemnify vendors against trademark and copyright infringement claims concerning merchandise manufactured specifically for or on behalf of the Company; c real estate leases, under which we may agree to indemnify the lessors from claims arising from our use of the property; and d agreements with our directors, officers and employees, under which we may agree to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their relationship with us. We have director and officer liability insurance, which, subject to the policy conditions, provides coverage for indemnification amounts payable by us with respect to our directors and officers up to specified limits and subject to certain deductibles. If we believe that a loss is both probable and estimable for a particular matter, the loss is accrued in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 450, Contingencies. With respect to any matter, we could change our belief as to whether a loss is probable or estimable, or its estimate of loss, at any time. NOTE 11.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows Level I Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level II Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level I. Level III Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The table below segregates all financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at least annually into the most appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to determine the fair value in thousands February 2, 2013 January 28, 2012 Level I Level II Level III Level I Level II Level III Short-term investments Long-term investments 1,912 1,382 Total investments 1,912 1,382 Long-term investments are reported in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.
