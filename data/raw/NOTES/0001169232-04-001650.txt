AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Optimal Robotics Corp. as at
December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the consolidated statements of operations,
deficit and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2003. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing
standards and generally accepted auditing standards in the United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable
assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2003
and 2002 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2003 in accordance with
Canadian generally accepted accounting principles. s/ KPMG LLP

1.  Nature of operations    Optimal Robotics Corp. the Company is engaged in the development,
marketing, installation and servicing of automated transaction products
designed for use in the retail sector. The Company principal product
focus is its U-ScanR system, a self-service checkout system for the
retail industry. The Company also provides hardware maintenance and repair
outsourcing services throughout North America.
2.  Significant accounting policies    These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in Canada. These principles
conform, in all material respects, with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States, except as described in note 20. The
principal accounting policies of the Company are summarized as follows    a  Principles of consolidation       These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated on
consolidation.
b  Cash and cash equivalents       Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and balances with
banks and highly liquid debt instruments with original terms to
maturity of three months or less.
c  Short-term investments       Short-term investments include investments with maturities greater
than three months and less than a year as well as investments with
maturities greater than a year that can be promptly liquidated.
Investments are carried at the lower of amortized cost and market
value.
d  Securitizations       Securitization transactions are recorded as sales of accounts
receivable when the control of the asset is transferred to the
purchaser. Transactions recorded in this manner result in the
removal of the accounts receivable sold from the Company balance
sheet. Discount fees on the portfolio of receivables sold are
recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.
e  Inventories       Raw material inventories are stated at the lower of landed cost or
replacement cost. Finished goods and work in process inventories are
stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is
determined on the basis of weighted average cost.                    39 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

2.  Significant accounting policies continued    e  Inventories continued       To provide maintenance and repair services to its customers, the
Company maintains significant levels of replacement parts. Parts are
stated at cost. The Company provides an allowance for obsolescence
and shrinkage. The costs of refurbishing parts are included in the
cost of sales as incurred.
Periodic revisions to allowance estimates are required, based upon
the evaluation of several factors, including changes in estimated
product life cycles, usage levels, and technology changes. Changes
in these estimates are reflected immediately in income.
f  Research and investment tax credits       Research and investment tax credits are recorded as a reduction of
the related expense or the cost of the assets acquired. Tax credits
are recorded in the accounts when reasonable assurance exists that
they will be realized.
g  Property and equipment       Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Amortization is
provided for over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the
straight-line method at the following annual rates       
Test units                            33%
Equipment                            10%
Computer equipment and software                 33%
Leasehold improvements                Over lease term
h  Goodwill and other intangible assets       Goodwill       Goodwill is the residual amount that results when the purchase price
of an acquired business exceeds the sum of the amounts allocated to
the assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, based on their fair
values. Goodwill is allocated as of the date of the business
combination to the Company reporting units that are expected to
benefit from the synergies of the business combination.                    40 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

2.  Significant accounting policies continued    h  Goodwill and other intangible assets continued       Goodwill continued       Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be
impaired. The impairment test is carried out in two steps. In the
first step, the carrying amount of the reporting unit is compared
with its fair value. When the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds
its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered
not to be impaired and the second step of the test is not required.
The second step is performed when the carrying amount of a reporting
unit exceeds its fair value, in which case the implied fair value of
the reporting unit goodwill is compared with its carrying amount
to measure the impairment loss, if any. When the carrying amount of
the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of
goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the
excess and is presented as a separate line item on the consolidated
statement of operations.
Based on the impairment tests performed as of December 31, 2003 and
2002, the Company concluded that no goodwill impairment charge was
required.
Prior to the adoption of the Canadian Institute of Chartered
Accountants CICA Handbook Section 3062 on January 1, 2002,
goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over its expected
useful life. The following information presents the impact of
goodwill amortization in fiscal 2001       
2003       2002      2001
Reported net loss earnings         $ 6,168,392  $ 5,327,230  $9,305,691

Diluted                     041      035     060
Other intangible assets       Intangible assets acquired either individually or with a group of
other assets are initially recognized and measured at cost. The cost
of a group of intangible assets, including those acquired in a
business combination that meet the specified criteria for
recognition apart from goodwill, is allocated to the individual
assets based on their relative fair values.                    41 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

2.  Significant accounting policies continued    h  Goodwill and other intangible assets continued       Other intangible assets continued       Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method at
the following annual rates       
Customer list                          20%
Patent costs                    over patent life
License                     over license term of
44 months
Customer contracts and customer relationships are presented at the
fair value assigned in the context of a business acquisition and are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of
six years.
i  Impairment and disposal of long-lived assets       In December 2002, the CICA issued Handbook Section 3063, Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets and revised Section 3475, Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets and Discontinued Operations. Together, these
two sections supersede the write-down and disposal provisions of
Section 3061, Property, Plant and Equipment as well as Section 3475,
Discontinued Operations.
Section 3063 amends existing guidance on long-lived asset impairment
measurement and establishes standards for the recognition,
measurement and disclosure of the impairment of long-lived assets
held for use by the Company. It requires that an impairment loss be
recognized for long-lived assets, consisting of property and
equipment and intangible assets with definite useful lives, when the
carrying amount of an asset to be held and used exceeds the sum of
the undiscounted cash flows expected from its use and disposal; the
impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the
carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Section 3475
provides a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be
disposed of by sale. Section 3475 provides specified criteria for
classifying an asset as held-for-sale and requires assets classified
as held-for-sale to be measured at the lower of their carrying
amounts or fair value, less costs to sell. Section 3475 also
broadens the scope of businesses that qualify for reporting as
discontinued operations to include any disposals of a component of
an entity, which comprises operations and cash flows that can be
clearly distinguished from the rest of the Company, and changes the
timing of recognizing losses on such operations.                    42 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

2.  Significant accounting policies continued    i  Impairment and disposal of long-lived assets continued       On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted Section 3063 on the
impairment of long-lived assets held for use and the revised
standards contained in Section 3475 on disposal of long-lived assets
and discontinued operations. There was no impact on the Company
financial statements as a result of adopting these recommendations.
j  Income taxes       The Company provides for income taxes using the asset and liability
method of tax allocation. Under this method, future income tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on deductible or taxable
temporary differences between financial statement values and tax
values of assets and liabilities using substantively enacted income
tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the
differences are expected to reverse.
The Company establishes a valuation allowance against future income
tax assets if, based on available information, it is more likely
than not that some or all of the future income tax assets will not
be realized.
k  Revenue recognition       Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment, delivery or
upon customer acceptance of the product, based upon the terms as
defined in the customer contract. Installation service revenue,
which is billed separately from product sales, is recognized at the
time the service has been provided to the customers. Revenue from
maintenance and repair services, which is subject to separate
contracts, is deferred and amortized ratably over the term of the
contract.
l  Foreign currency translation       Monetary assets and liabilities of the Canadian and foreign
operations denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are
translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet
dates. Other assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other
than the U.S. dollar are translated at the exchange rates prevailing
when the assets were acquired or the liabilities incurred. Revenues
and expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar
are translated at the approximate rate of exchange in effect on the
date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses are
included in the determination of net earnings.
m  Research and development expenses       Research costs, which include all costs incurred to establish
technological feasibility, are charged to operations in the year in
which they are incurred. Technological feasibility has been defined
as the completion of the product design for the computer software.                    43 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

costs.
n  Stock-based compensation       In November 2003, the CICA revised Handbook Section 3870,
Stock-based Compensation and other Stock-based Payments, with
respect to the accounting for stock-based compensation and other
stock-based payments. The revised recommendations require that
beginning January 1, 2004, the fair value-based method be used to
account for all transactions whereby goods and services are received
in exchange for stock-based compensation and other stock-based
payments. The revised standard no longer permits the use of the
settlement method for stock-based employee compensation awards.
Under the settlement method, any consideration paid by employees on
the exercise of stock options is credited to share capital and no
compensation expense is recognized. Under the fair value-based
method, compensation cost is measured at fair value at the date of
grant and is expensed over the award vesting periods.
In accordance with one of the transitional options permitted under
Section 3870, the Company has elected to early adopt the new
recommendations effective January 1, 2003 and prospectively apply
the standard for employee stock awards granted after January 1,
2003. Previously, the Company applied the settlement method of
accounting to employee stock options.                    44 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

o  Earnings per share       Basic earnings per share are determined using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings per share are calculated using the treasury stock method.
Diluted earnings per share are computed in a manner consistent with
basic earnings per share except that the weighted average shares
outstanding are increased to include additional shares from the
assumed exercise of options and warrants, if dilutive. The number of
additional shares is calculated by assuming that outstanding options
and warrants were exercised and that the proceeds from such
exercises are used to repurchase common shares at the average market
price during the reporting period.
p  Use of estimates       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Significant areas requiring the use of
management estimates include estimating the useful lives of
long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible
assets, estimating the fair value of identifiable intangibles
acquired in a business acquisition, estimating stock-based
compensation costs, as well as assessing the recoverability of
inventories, goodwill, long-lived assets, tax credits receivable and
future tax assets. The reported amounts and note disclosures are
determined to reflect the most probable set of economic conditions
and planned courses of action. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.                    46 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

2.  Significant accounting policies continued    q  Guarantees       On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the new recommendations of
the CICA, Accounting Guideline 14, Disclosure of Guarantees, which
clarifies disclosure requirements for certain guarantees. The
guideline does not provide guidance on the measurement and
recognition of a guarantor liability for obligations under
guarantees. The guideline defines a guarantee to be a contract
including an indemnity that contingently requires the Company to
make payments to a third party based on i changes in an underlying
interest rate, foreign exchange rate, equity or commodity
instrument, index or other variable, that is related to an asset, a
liability or an equity security of the counterparty, ii failure of
another party to perform under an obligating agreement or iii
failure of another party to pay its indebtedness when due.
As explained in note 13 b, the Company is contractually bound to
indemnify a customer without limitations for damages incurred in
connection with a civil action. A reasonable estimate of the maximum
potential amount the Company could be required to pay to
counterparties cannot be made given the nature of the
indemnification.
3.  Business acquisitions    RBA Inc.
On September 30, 2003, the Company acquired substantially all of the
assets and the ongoing business of RBA Inc. RBA, a company that
provides hardware maintenance outsourcing services, including debit/credit
card system maintenance and computer maintenance services, across Canada.
The net assets acquired for cash are approximately $60 million CA$81
million, subject to the determination of certain post closing
adjustments, if any. The acquisition is accounted for by the Company using
the purchase method and the results of RBA are consolidated with those of
the Company from the date of acquisition.
The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed at date of acquisition. The Company is in
the process of finalizing its valuation of the net assets acquired,
including the determination of post-closing adjustments and the allocation
to goodwill and to other intangible assets; thus, the allocation of the
purchase price is subject to final modifications.                    47 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

b  In 1995 and 1996, the Company received demand letters from the same
claimant alleging patent infringement. In July 1999, the claimant
filed a civil action alleging patent infringement in the United
States District Court for the District of Utah against the Company
and PSC Inc., one of the Company suppliers. In addition, the
claimant filed claims against one of the Company customers, which
is contractually entitled to be indemnified by the Company for any
damages incurred by it in connection with any patent infringement.
On January 27, 2004, the Company entered into a settlement agreement
with the claimant, which resolved all potential claims by the
claimant and brought this action to an end. This settlement did not
have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results
of operations of the Company.
The Company also received a legal letter from another party in 1999,
and again in February 2001, alleging infringement of another patent.
In March 2003, this claimant also sent a third demand letter
alleging infringement of additional patents. The Company believes
this second claimant claims to be without merit and intends to
vigorously defend its position should this second claimant initiate
a civil action. No amounts have been specified in these claims. It
is not possible at this time to make an estimate of the amount of
damages, if any, that may result and, accordingly, no provision has
been made in these financial statements with respect to such claims.                    55 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

15.  Restructuring    In 2003, the Company reduced its workforce in an effort to increase
operating efficiencies, decrease overall general and administrative
expenses and improve financial results. In total, the Company incurred
charges of $747,919 related primarily to severance and accrued vacations,
all of which were fully paid by December 31, 2003.
In 2002, the Company closed the assembly facility in Phoenix, Arizona, and
the support hub in Covington, Kentucky in an effort to consolidate
operations. The costs incurred as a result of the closures related mainly
to lease costs, severance payments and the write-down of inventories and
leasehold improvements. As at December 31, 2003, a provision of
approximately $133,000 2002 - $288,000 relating to future obligations
for leased premises is included in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.                    56 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

1  For purposes of calculating the income tax provision of the Company,
a tax liability is recognized on the foreign exchange gains which
arise on the conversion into Canadian dollars of the net monetary
assets denominated in U.S. dollars; such conversion is required for
tax purposes. Because these financial statements are presented in
U.S. dollars, this foreign exchange gain does not impact earnings
before income taxes even though the income tax provision includes a
tax liability for this gain. Future fluctuations in the foreign
exchange rate between the Canadian and U.S. dollar will change the
amount of the foreign exchange gains and thus the provision for
income taxes thereon.
The recovery of provision for income taxes is composed of the following    
2003       2002         2001
Current income taxes                    $  1,649,000  $ 1,989,547    $  4,858,095

$ 2,346,456     $   92,456
In assessing the realizability of future tax assets, management considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the future
income tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of future tax
assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and/or
tax planning strategies.
The Company has approximately $10 million of losses carryforward available
to reduce federal taxable income in the United States. These losses expire
in 2022 and 2023.
17.  Segmented information    Prior to fiscal 2003, the Company reported its operations under one
segment, the development, marketing, installation and sale of automated
transaction products designed for use in the retail sector. As a result of
the acquisitions discussed in note 3, combined with lower product sales
and an increase in service revenue from hardware and software maintenance,
the Company now operates in two segments, namely product sales and
services as described in note 1. The corporate segment is responsible for
the Company financial and corporate direction, and also includes general
expenses which cannot be directly attributed to a specific segment.
Management measures the results of operations based on segment gross
margin provided by each business segment.
The prior years' figures present revenues and cost of sales by products
only since, until the acquisition referred to above, management reported
its operations as one segment.                    58 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

18.  Financial instruments    a  Credit risk       Credit risk results from the possibility that a loss may occur from
the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of
the contract. Financial instruments that potentially subject the
Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash,
investments and accounts receivable. Cash is maintained with
high-credit quality financial institutions. Investments consist of
discounted notes issued by high-credit quality corporations. For
accounts receivable, the Company performs periodic credit
evaluations and typically does not require collateral. Allowances
are maintained for potential credit losses consistent with the
credit risk, historical trends, general economic conditions and
other information.

available information about the financial instrument. These
estimates are subjective in nature and often cannot be determined
with precision.
The Company has determined that the carrying values of cash,
accounts receivable, tax credits receivable, accounts payable and
accrued liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values
due to the relatively short periods to maturity of these
instruments.
The fair value of investments as at December 31, 2003 amounted to
approximately $74,456,000 2002 - $76,714,000 which was calculated
by reference to various market data.

requires compensation costs to be recognized for the
difference, if any, between the quoted market price of the
stock as at the grant date and the amount the individual must
pay to acquire the stock. Prior to the cancellation of the
outstanding stock options referred to in note 12 a, certain
of the Company stock options were variable because the
exercise price was not known until the options were exercised.                    62 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

goods and services from non-employees in exchange for equity
instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. In
1996, a total of 285,600 warrants were granted to
non-employees, the fair value of which was $833,919 and was
charged to deficit as share issue costs.
2  Change in reporting currency          In 1998, the Company adopted the U.S. dollar as its reporting
currency. Under Canadian GAAP, at the time of change in
reporting currency, the historical financial statements were
presented using a translation of convenience. Under U.S. GAAP,
the financial statements, including prior years, are
translated according to the current rate method. Accordingly,
the cumulative translation account included as part of
shareholders' equity under Canadian GAAP does not exist for
U.S. GAAP purposes.
c  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Loss       Under U.S. GAAP, SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income
establishes standards for reporting and presentation of
comprehensive income and its components in a full set of financial
statements. Comprehensive income consists of net earnings loss and
all other changes in shareholders' equity that do not result from
transactions with shareholders. These changes include cumulative
foreign currency translation adjustments. The statement requires
only additional disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements; it does not affect the Company financial position or
results of operations.                    66 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

e  Recent accounting pronouncements       i  Variable interest entities          In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued FIN46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities. This interpretation provides guidance on the
application of consolidation accounting principles to all
entities. Its principles require an enterprise to determine
whether an entity in which it has an interest is a variable
interest entity VIE, or an entity that is other than a
VIE, to which the basic consolidation principles apply. An
enterprise consolidates a VIE if that enterprise has a
variable interest that will absorb a majority of the VIE
expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the VIE
expected residual returns if they occur, or both.
FIN46R applies to financial statements of public companies
that have an interest in VIEs other than special-purpose
entities for which the standard is already effective for
periods ending after March 15, 2004. Similar standards were
issued in Canada, but are only effective for annual or interim
periods beginning after November 1, 2004. The Company does not
expect that the adoption of these standards to have a material
effect on its financial statements.                    67 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

20.  Canadian/U.S. Reporting Differences continued    e  Recent accounting pronouncements continued       ii Asset retirement obligations          These standards were established for the recognition,
measurement and disclosure of liabilities for asset retirement
obligations and the associated retirement cost. The standards
apply to legal obligations associated with the retirements of
a tangible long-lived asset that results from acquisition,
development or normal operations. The standard requires an
entity to record the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred
and when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. An
entity is subsequently required to allocate the asset
retirement cost to expense using a systematic and rational
method over its estimated life. The standards are effective in
Canada and the US for fiscal years beginning on or after
January 1, 2004. The adoption of this standard is not expected
to have a material impact on the Company financial
statements.

22.  Subsequent events    a  Terra Payments Inc.       On January 20, 2004, the Company entered into a Combination
Agreement with Terra Payments Inc. Terra, a Canadian
publicly-traded company that offers proprietary technology and
services to businesses to accept credit card, electronic cheque and
direct debit payments. Terra processes credit card payments
primarily for non-face-to-face transactions, including
mail-order/telephone order, licensed on-line gaming and other
on-line merchants, as well as for retail point-of-sale merchants.
Terra also processes cheques and direct debits online and by
telephone.
The agreement provides for a stock-for-stock merger in which 04532
shares of the Company common shares will be exchanged for each
share of Terra. The total purchase price will be approximately $646
million and will be paid through of the issuance of approximately
72 million common shares by the Company, the assumption of options
and warrants issued by Terra and estimated transaction costs of the
Company.                    68 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

22.  Subsequent events continued    a  Terra Payments Inc. continued       The estimated fair value of the assets to be acquired and
liabilities to be assumed include tangible assets of approximately
$110 million, goodwill and other intangible assets of $45 million
and liabilities of $91 million. The Company is presently proceeding
to finalize its valuation of the assets to be acquired and
liabilities to be assumed, including the allocation of the purchase
price to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Thus, the
allocation of the purchase price will be subject to final
modifications once the acquisition is consummated.
The per share value of the shares issued as consideration for the
business acquisition was $848 which was determined using the
Company average closing share price on NASDAQ over a reasonable
period before and after the date the terms of the business
combination were agreed to and announced.
Each outstanding Terra stock option and warrant, including Terra
options to be issued on closing of this transaction, will become a
04532 stock option or warrant to acquire a common share of the
Company. The Company will effectively issue approximately 18
million stock options and warrants having a fair value of
approximately $56 million, or a weighted average of $308 per
share, to acquire the Terra options and warrants. The fair value of
the vested stock options and warrants of approximately $25 million
will be recorded as purchase consideration. The fair value of the
unvested stock options of approximately $31 million will be
recorded as deferred compensation, which will be amortized over the
vesting period of three years.
The completion of the transaction is subject to certain conditions,
including approval by the shareholders of both companies and
regulatory approvals. The agreement provides for the payment of a
termination fee by either Terra or the Company in certain
circumstances. The transaction is expected to close in April 2004.
The Company will account for the transaction using the purchase
method from the closing date.
b  Sale of U-ScanR business       On February 16, 2004, the Company entered into an agreement in
principle with NCR Corporation NCR to sell its U-ScanR
self-checkout business, including all related tangible assets,
intellectual property rights, and obligations, for $30 million in
cash. The purchase price is subject to adjustments at the date of
closing based on the net assets at that date. Completion of the
transaction is subject to the execution of definitive documentation,
approval by shareholders, receipt of certain third-party consents
and approvals and other conditions. The Company has agreed to pay
NCR a termination fee under certain circumstances. The transaction
is expected to close in April 2004.                    69 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

Systems       On February 20, 2004, the Company entered into an agreement to
acquire the hardware service division of Systech Retail Systems for
a cash consideration of $3 million. Completion of the transaction is
subject to the execution of definitive documentation, receipt of
certain third party consents and approvals, and other customary
closing conditions. The Company will account for the transaction
