Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. The
management of The ServiceMaster Company The Company is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed
to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and board of
directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published
financial statements.
All internal control
systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
Management assessed the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control
Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment we believe that, as
of December 31, 2005, the Companys internal control over financial reporting
is effective based on those criteria.
Deloitte Touche LLP,
the Companys auditors, have issued an attestation report on our managements
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005. This attestation report is included below.
Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The
ServiceMaster Company
We have audited managements assessment, included in
the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, that The ServiceMaster Company and subsidiaries the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal
control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error
or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections
of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In our opinion, managements assessment that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,
2005 of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2006 expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial statements. s/Deloitte Touche LLP

and intangible assets that are not amortized are subject to at least an
annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value based test. In the
third quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge
associated with the goodwill and intangible assets at its TruGreen LandCare
business unit. This charge, which is included in the results of continuing
operations for 2003, totaled $189 million pre-tax, $156 million after-tax,
and $053 per diluted share. Also in the third quarter of 2003, the Company
recorded a non-cash impairment charge associated with the goodwill and
intangible assets at its American Residential Services ARS and American
Mechanical Services AMS operations. The Company is currently holding these operations
for sale. Accordingly, the financial results for the ARS and AMS operations,
as well as the impairment charge related to these operations $292 million
pre-tax, $227 million after-tax, are classified with the financial statement
caption businesses held pending sale and discontinued operations for all
periods. See the Goodwill and Intangible Assets note in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. 2 In January 2005, the Company announced that it had
reached a comprehensive agreement with the Internal Revenue Service regarding
its examination of the Companys federal income taxes through the year 2002.
As a result of this agreement, the Company recorded a non-cash reduction in
its 2004 tax provision, thereby increasing net income by approximately $159
million. Approximately $150 million related to continuing operations $49
per diluted share and $9 million related to businesses held pending sale and
discontinued operations $03 per diluted share. See the Income Taxes note
in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 3 The Company intends to sell its American Residential
Services ARS and American Mechanical Services AMS companies so it can
concentrate resources on its main growth businesses. These operations were
previously disclosed as the Companys ARS/AMS segment. Because the Company
intends to sell these companies, the results of these operations are
classified within the financial statement caption businesses held pending
sale and discontinued operations in all periods. See the Management
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations for a
discussion of the components of businesses held for sale and discontinued
operations. See accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

27 Notes To The Consolidated Financial
Statements
Significant Accounting Policies
Summary: The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of ServiceMaster and its
majority-owned subsidiary partnerships and corporations, collectively referred
to as the Company. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. In 2005, the Company reported its gross debt borrowings and payments in the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows. Historically, the Company netted debt borrowings and payments. The 2004 and 2003 information has been changed
to conform to the 2005 presentation. The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to
make certain estimates and assumptions required under generally accepted
accounting principles GAAP which may differ from actual results. The more
significant areas requiring the use of management estimates relate to the
allowance for receivables, accruals for self-insured retention limits related
to medical, workers compensation, auto and general liability insurance claims,
accruals for home warranty and termite damage claims, the possible outcomes of
outstanding litigation, accruals for income tax liabilities as well as deferred
tax accounts, the deferral and amortization of customer acquisition costs,
useful lives for depreciation and amortization expense, and the valuation of
tangible and intangible assets. 
The
allowance for receivables is developed based on several factors including
overall customer credit quality, historical write-off experience and specific
account analyses that project the ultimate collectibility of the outstanding
balances. As such, these factors may change over time causing the reserve level
to vary.
The
Company carries insurance policies on insurable risks at levels which it
believes to be appropriate, including workers compensation, auto and general
liability risks. The Company has self-insured retention limits and insured
layers of excess insurance coverage above those limits. Accruals for
self-insurance losses and warranty claims in the American Home Shield business
are made based on the Companys claims experience and actuarial projections.
Current activity could differ causing a change in estimates. The Company has
certain liabilities with respect to existing or potential claims, lawsuits, and
other proceedings. The Company accrues for these liabilities when it is
probable that future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably
estimated. Any resulting adjustments, which could be material, are recorded in
the period the adjustments are identified. 
The Company records deferred
income tax balances based on the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and income tax purposes. There are significant amortizable intangible
assets for tax reporting purposes not for financial reporting purposes which
arose as a result of the Companys reincorporation from partnership to
corporate form in 1997. The Company records its deferred tax items based on the
estimated value of the tax basis. The Company adjusts tax estimates when
required to reflect changes based on factors such as changes in tax laws,
results of tax authority reviews and statutory limitations.
Fixed
assets and intangible assets with finite lives are depreciated and amortized on
a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. These lives are based
on the Companys previous experience for similar assets, the potential for
market obsolescence and other industry and business data. An impairment loss
would be recognized if and when the undiscounted future cash flows derived from
the asset are less than its carrying amount. Changes in the estimated useful
lives or in the asset values could cause the Company to adjust its book value
or future expense accordingly. 
The Company does not amortize
its goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company tests these
assets for impairment, at a minimum, on an annual basis October 1st
by applying a fair-value based test. An impairment loss would be recorded if
and when the Company determines that the expected present value of the future
cash flows is less than the book value. As permitted under SFAS 142, the
Company carries forward a reporting units valuation from the most recent
valuation under the following conditions: the assets and liabilities of the
reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value
calculation, the most recent fair value calculation resulted in an amount that
exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin, and
based on the facts and circumstances of events that have occurred since the
last fair value determination, the likelihood that a current fair value
calculation would result in an impairment would be remote. 
Revenue: Revenue from lawn care,
pest control, liquid and fumigation termite applications are recognized as the
services are provided. Revenue from landscaping services are recognized as they
are earned based upon monthly contract arrangements or when services are
performed for non-contractual arrangements. The Company eradicates termites
through the use of baiting stations, as well as through non-baiting methods
e.g., fumigation or liquid treatments. Termite services using baiting
stations, as well as home warranty services, are frequently sold through annual
contracts for a one-time, upfront payment. Direct costs of these contracts
service costs for termite contracts and claim costs for warranty contracts
are expensed as incurred. The Company recognizes revenue over the life of these
contracts in proportion to the expected direct costs. Revenue from trade name
licensing arrangements is recognized when earned. Franchised revenue which in
the aggregate represents approximately three percent of consolidated revenue
consists principally of continuing monthly fees based upon the franchisees
customer level revenue. Monthly fee revenue is recognized when the related
customer level revenue is reported by the franchisee and collectibility is
assured. Franchised revenue also includes initial fees resulting from the sale of
a franchise. These fees are fixed and are recognized as revenue when
collectibility is assured and all material services or conditions relating to
the sale have been substantially performed. Total franchise fee profits
excluding trade name licensing comprised 105, 103 and 109 percent of
consolidated operating income excluding the impairment charge in 2003 before
headquarter overhead in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 
The
Company had $433 million and $430 million of deferred revenue at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively, which consist primarily of payments received for
annual contracts relating to home warranty, termite baiting, pest control and
lawn care services. The revenue related to these services is recognized over
the contractual period as the direct costs emerge, such as when the services
are performed or claims are incurred. 
Deferred
Customer Acquisition Costs:
Customer acquisition costs, which are incremental and direct costs of 
28 Notes To The Consolidated Financial
Statements
obtaining
a customer, are deferred and amortized over the life of the related contract in
proportion to revenue recognized. These costs include sales commissions and
direct selling costs which can be shown to have resulted in a successful sale.
Interim
Reporting: TruGreen ChemLawn has significant seasonality in its
business. In the winter and early spring, this business sells a series of lawn
applications to customers which are rendered primarily in March through October
the production season. This business incurs incremental selling expenses at
the beginning of the year that directly relate to successful sales for which
the revenues are recognized in later quarters. On an interim basis, TruGreen
ChemLawn defers these incremental selling expenses, pre-season advertising
costs and annual repairs and maintenance procedures that are performed in the
first quarter. These costs are deferred and recognized in proportion to the
revenue over the production season, and are not deferred beyond the calendar
year-end. Other business segments of the Company also defer, on an interim
basis, advertising costs incurred early in the year. These costs are deferred
and recognized approximately in proportion to revenue over the balance of the
year, and are not deferred beyond the calendar year-end. 
Advertising: As discussed in the Interim
Reporting note above, certain pre-season advertising costs are deferred and
recognized approximately in proportion to the revenue over the year. Certain
other advertising costs are expensed when the advertising occurs. The cost of
direct-response advertising at Terminix, consisting primarily of direct-mail
promotions, is capitalized and amortized over its expected period of future
benefits, which is the one-year contract life. 
Inventory
Valuation: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost primarily
on a weighted average cost basis or market. The inventory primarily represents
finished goods to be used on the customers premises or sold to franchisees. 
Property
and Equipment, Intangible Assets and Goodwill: Buildings and equipment
used in the business are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated
useful lives using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.
The estimated useful lives for building and improvements range from 10 to 40
years, while the estimated useful lives for equipment range from three to 10
years. Leasehold improvements relating to leased facilities are depreciated
over the remaining life of the lease. Technology equipment as well as software
and development have an estimated useful life of three to seven years.
Intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill $15 billion, trade names
$215 million and other intangible assets $15 million. 
As
required by SFAS 142, goodwill is not subject to amortization and intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized until their useful lives
are determined to no longer be indefinite. Goodwill and intangible assets that
are not subject to amortization are subject to an assessment for impairment by
applying a fair-value based test on an annual basis or more frequently if
circumstances indicate a potential impairment. As permitted under SFAS 142, the
Company carries forward a reporting units valuation from the most recent
valuation under the following conditions; the assets and liabilities of the
reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value
calculation, the most recent fair value calculation resulted in an amount that
exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin, and
based on the facts and circumstances of events that have occurred since the
last fair value determination, the likelihood that a current fair value
calculation would result in an impairment would be remote. For the 2005
goodwill and trade name impairment review, the Company carried forward the
valuations for all reporting units except ARS. A valuation analysis performed
for ARS indicated no impairment.
As
required by SFAS 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets, the Companys long-lived assets, including fixed assets and intangible
assets other than goodwill, are tested for recoverability whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be
recoverable. Based on these reviews, when the undiscounted future cash flows
derived from using the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an
impairment loss is recognized based on the assets fair value, and the carrying
amount of the asset is reduced accordingly.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments and Credit Risk: The carrying amounts of
receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value
because of the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying amounts of
long-term notes receivables approximate fair value as the effective interest
rates for these instruments are comparable to market rates at year-end. The
carrying amount of current and long-term marketable securities also approximate
fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported net-of-tax as a component
of accumulated comprehensive income loss. The carrying amount of total debt
is $658 million and $805 million and the estimated fair value is approximately
$666 million and $875 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
estimated fair value of debt is based upon borrowing rates currently available
to the Company for long-term borrowings with similar terms and maturities.
The
Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes. The Company has entered into specific financial
arrangements in the normal course of business to manage certain market risks,
with a policy of matching positions and limiting the terms of contracts to relatively
short durations. The effect of derivative financial instrument transactions is
not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In
accordance with SFAS 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, the Companys interest rate swap agreements are classified as fair
value hedges and, as such, gains and losses on the swaps as well as the gains
and losses on the related hedged items are recognized in current earnings. 
Derivative
financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to financial and
credit risk, consist principally of investments and receivables. Investments
consist primarily of publicly traded debt and common equity securities. The
Company periodically reviews its portfolio of investments to 
29 Notes To The Consolidated Financial
Statements
determine
whether there has been an other than temporary decline in the value of the
investments from factors such as deterioration in the financial condition of
the issuer or the markets in which it competes. Receivables have little
concentration of credit risk due to the large number of customers with
relatively small balances and their dispersion across geographical areas. The
Company maintains an allowance for losses based upon the expected collectibility
of receivables.
Income
Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes under SFAS 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes. This Statement uses an asset and liability approach for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the
Companys financial statements or tax returns. Deferred income taxes are
provided to reflect the differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. 
Earnings
Per Share: Basic earnings per share is based on the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The
weighted average number of common shares used in the diluted earnings per share
calculation include the incremental effect related to outstanding options and
stock appreciation rights SARS whose market price is in excess of the grant
price. Shares potentially issuable under convertible securities have been
considered outstanding for purposes of the diluted earnings per share
calculations. In computing diluted earnings per share, the after-tax interest
expense related to convertible securities is added back to net income in the
numerator, while the number of shares used in the denominator include the
shares issuable upon conversion of the securities.
Stock-Based
Compensation: Beginning in 2003, the Company has been accounting
for employee stock options as compensation expense in accordance with SFAS 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS 148, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123, provides alternative methods of transitioning to the
fair-value based method of accounting for employee stock options as
compensation expense. The Company is using the prospective method of SFAS 148
and is expensing the fair value of new employee option grants awarded
subsequent to 2002. 
Prior to
2003, the Company had accounted for employee share options under the intrinsic
method of Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25. Compensation expense determined
under the fair-value based method of SFAS 123 relating to newly issued awards
as well as the unvested portion of the previously issued awards would have
resulted in proforma reported net income and net earnings per share as follows

Newly
Issued Accounting Statements and Positions: In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123
revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R. This Statement replaces
SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R requires that
stock options and share grants be recorded at fair value and this value is
recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period. The Statement
requires that compensation expense be recorded for newly issued awards as well
as the unvested portion of previously issued awards that remain outstanding as
of the effective date of this Statement. The provisions of this Statement
become effective beginning with the Companys 2006 fiscal year January 1,
2006. The Company had previously disclosed that it had expected to restate
prior periods as if this Statement were in effect for all periods. As permitted
by this Statement, the Company will instead prospectively apply the provisions
of this Statement effective January 1, 2006. The Company currently estimates
that the adoption of this Statement will reduce earnings per share in 2006 by
approximately $01. 
Recently
Adopted Accounting Principles: The Company adopted the
provisions of FASB Interpretation 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations FIN 47, an interpretation of FASB Statement 143 Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143. FIN 47 clarifies that an entity is
required to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation
when incurred if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated.
This interpretation further clarified the term conditional asset retirement
obligation, as used in SFAS 143, as a legal obligation to perform an asset
retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are
conditional on a future event that may or may not be within control of the
entity. FIN 47 is effective for companies no later than the end of their first
fiscal year ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have
a significant impact on the Company. 
30 Notes To The Consolidated Financial
Statements
Business Segment Reporting
The business of the Company
is conducted through five operating segments: TruGreen ChemLawn, TruGreen
LandCare, Terminix, American Home Shield and Other Operations. The Company
intends to sell its American Residential Services ARS and American Mechanical
Services AMS companies so it can concentrate resources on its main growth
businesses. The Company has retained an investment banking firm to serve as its
financial advisor in this process. The ARS/AMS operations provide heating,
ventilation, air conditioning HVAC, plumbing and electrical installation and
repair services and were previously disclosed as the Companys ARS/AMS segment.
Because the Company intends to sell these businesses, their operating results
are reported within the financial statement caption businesses held pending
sale and discontinued operations for all periods presented. 
The Company has also expanded
its business segment reporting to allow for better ongoing visibility into the
components of the business. The companies that previously were reported within
the TruGreen segment have been further broken out into the TruGreen ChemLawn
segment and the TruGreen LandCare segment. TruGreen LandCare is an important
part of the Companys continuing operations and presenting its results as a
separate segment recognizes the importance of this business to the continued
growth of the enterprise while also enhancing overall disclosure. All
previously reported segment financial information reflects the aforementioned
changes in segment reporting.
In accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards 131, Disclosures About Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, the Companys reportable segments are
strategic business units that offer different services. The TruGreen ChemLawn
segment provides residential and commercial lawn care services. The TruGreen
LandCare segment provides landscaping services to commercial customers. The
Terminix segment provides termite and pest control services to residential and
commercial customers. The American Home Shield segment provides home warranties
to consumers that cover HVAC, plumbing and other home systems and appliances.
This segment also includes home inspection services provided by AmeriSpec. The
Other Operations segment includes the franchised and company-owned operations
of ServiceMaster Clean, Furniture Medic and Merry Maids, which provide disaster
restoration, commercial cleaning, carpet and upholstery cleaning, furniture
repair and maid services. This segment also includes the Companys headquarters
operations, which provide various technology, marketing, finance, legal and
other support services to the business units. Information
regarding the accounting policies used by the Company is described in the
Significant Accounting Policies Note. The Company derives substantially all of
its revenue from customers in the United States with less than two percent
generated in foreign markets. Operating expenses of the business units consist
primarily of direct costs. Identifiable assets are those used in carrying out
the operations of the business unit and include intangible assets directly
related to its operations.
Segment
information for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 is presented

operations. In order to facilitate
comparisons of ongoing operating performance of continuing operations, the
Company also has presented the TruGreen LandCare segment results after
adjusting for the impact of the impairment charge. 3 Capital employed is a non-U.S. GAAP measure that is
defined as the segments total assets less liabilities, exclusive of debt
balances. The Company believes this
information is useful to investors in helping them compute return on capital
measures and therefore better understand the performance of the Companys
business segments. The calculation of
capital employed for the American Home Shield segment includes approximately
$283 million, $258 million and $221 million of cash and marketable securities
at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The investment income and realized gains/losses on these assets
are reported below operating income in non-operating income/expense. In order to facilitate the comparison of
return on invested capital for the American Home Shield segment, the Company
has also presented capital employed for this segment excluding cash and
marketable securities. The negative
capital employed balances primarily result from deferred revenue and amounts
payable to subcontractors. Presented
below is a reconciliation of total segment capital employed to the most
comparable U.S. GAAP measure.  In thousands 2005 2004 2003 Total Assets 3,028,870 3,140,202 2,956,426 Less Current

Goodwill
and Intangible Assets
In
accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Company
discontinued the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible
assets effective January 1, 2002.
Goodwill and intangible assets that are not amortized are subject to
assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value based test on an annual
basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The Company completed its annual assessment
of impairment as of October 1. 
In
the third quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge
associated with the goodwill and intangible assets at its TruGreen LandCare
business unit. This charge, which is
included in the results of continuing operations for 2003, totaled $189 million
pre-tax, $156 million after-tax, and $053 per diluted share. The impairment charge reported in continuing
operations included a portion of goodwill that was not deductible for tax
purposes, resulting in a tax benefit of $33 million, or only approximately 17
percent of the pre-tax impairment charge of $189 million. Also in the third quarter of 2003, the
Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge associated with the goodwill and
intangible assets at its ARS and AMS operations. These businesses are now being held pending sale, accordingly,
the financial results for the ARS and AMS operations, as well as the impairment
charge related to these operations $292 million pre-tax, $227 million
after-tax, have been classified to the financial statement caption businesses
held pending sale and discontinued operations for all periods. 
In April 2004, TruGreen ChemLawn acquired the assets of
Greenspace Limited, Canadas largest professional lawn care service
company. Intangible assets recorded
were less than $16 million. The balance
of goodwill and intangible assets that were added during 2004 relate to tuck-in
acquisitions completed by Terminix and TruGreen ChemLawn.
The increase in goodwill and intangible assets in 2005
relates to tuck-in acquisitions completed throughout the year by Terminix and
TruGreen ChemLawn, as well as the acquisition of a distributorship by
ServiceMaster Clean in the third quarter.

respectively. Annual amortization
expense of $5 million in 2005 is expected to decline over the next five years.
Income Taxes
In
January 2005, the Company reached a comprehensive agreement with the IRS
regarding its examination of the Companys federal income taxes through the
year 2002. As previously disclosed, the
Company had not been audited by the IRS during the period in which it operated
as a master limited partnership 1987 through 1997 or in subsequent
years. Consequently, the examination
covered numerous significant matters, including the tax consequences resulting
from the Companys reincorporation in 1997, and the sale of its large
Management Services segment in November 2001.
Pursuant to the agreement, the Company paid taxes and interest
primarily in February 2005 to the IRS and various states in the amount of
$131 million $112 million of increased taxes and $19 million of
interest. These payments represented
only one part of a four part agreement with the IRS, which also included: tax
savings of $25 million that were realized in 2004; a reduction of $45 million
in the estimated tax payments made during the second half of 2005 and a
deferred tax asset totaling $57 million that will be realized through 2016.
As
a result of this agreement, certain deferred tax assets, primarily related to
intangible assets, which had previously not been recorded due to uncertainties
associated with the complexity of the matters under review and the extended
period of time effectively covered by the IRS examination were recorded. This resulted in a non-cash reduction in the
Companys 2004 income tax provision, thereby increasing 2004 consolidated net
income by approximately $159 million $150 million related to continuing
operations and $9 million related to businesses held pending sale and
discontinued operations.
In
February 2006, the IRS concluded the 2003 and 2004 audits of the Companys tax
returns. There were no material
adjustments or payments resulting from these audits. In the first quarter of 2006, the IRS commenced the audit of the
Companys tax return for 2005. As with
any review of this 
33 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
nature,
the ultimate outcome of this IRS examination is not known at this time.
The
reconciliation of income tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to
the Companys effective income tax rate for continuing operations is as
follows 2005 2004 2003 Tax at U.S. federal statutory rate 350 350 350 State and local income taxes net of U.S. federal
benefit 33 36 65 Adjustment relating to the IRS agreement 553 Tax credits 10 07 22 Impairment of non-deductible goodwill 718 Other 14 05 64 Effective rate 387 169 1047 The effective tax rate for businesses held pending sale
and discontinued operations was tax expense of 395% in 2005 and tax benefits
of 727% and 210% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2005, the difference between these rates and the federal
statutory tax rate of 35% reflects state taxes, net of federal benefit, and
permanent items.
Income tax expense from continuing operations is as
follows In thousands 2005 Current Deferred Total U.S. federal 12,393 87,813 100,206 State and local 1,723 12,208 13,931 14,116 100,021 114,137 2004 Current Deferred Total U.S. federal 129,943 155,901 25,958 State and local 10,429 30,250 19,821 140,372 186,151 45,779 2003 Current Deferred Total U.S. federal 35,646 84,767 49,121 State and local 4,060 9,655 5,595 39,706 94,422 54,716 Deferred
income tax expense results from timing differences in the recognition of income
and expense for income tax and financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax balances reflect the net
tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes. The deferred tax asset primarily reflects
the impact of future tax deductions related to the Companys accruals and net
operating losses. Management believes
that, based upon its history of profitable operations, it is probable that its
deferred tax assets will be realized, primarily from the generation of future taxable
income. The deferred tax liability is
primarily attributable to the basis differences related to intangible
assets. The Company records its
deferred tax items based on the estimated value of the tax basis. 
In
2002, the Company adopted SFAS 142 which eliminated the requirement to record
in the financial statements amortization expense related to goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives.
The Company is able to continue to amortize the intangible assets for
tax purposes which will yield an average annual tax benefit of approximately
$57 million through 2012. Subsequent to
2012, the benefit from the step-up in tax basis that resulted from
reincorporation will be fully amortized.
The Company estimates that the divestitures of ARS and AMS will result
in a reduction of approximately $4 million in the average annual cash tax
benefits, however, the cash tax benefits in the year of divestiture will
increase such that the aggregate tax benefits are unchanged. Accounting standards require that the
Company recognize deferred taxes relating to the differences between the
financial reporting and tax basis of the assets. As the annual tax benefit from the amortization expense is
realized, the deferred tax liability increases, reflecting the declining tax
basis compared to the non-amortized book basis. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax balances are

difference in the tax

The majority of this liability will not actually be paid until a
business unit of the Company is sold.
At
December 31, 2005, the Company had tax effected federal and state net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $21 million, expiring at various dates up
to 2025. The Company also had federal
and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $4 million which expire at
various dates up to 2024.
In 2005, cash paid for income taxes were $146 million,
including a net payment of $86 million to the IRS and various states pursuant
to the Companys agreement with the IRS.
In 2004, total tax payments were $13 million. In 2003, the Company received net tax refunds of $1 million. 
Acquisitions
Acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase
method and, accordingly, the results of operations of the acquired businesses
have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements since
their dates of acquisition. The assets
and liabilities of these businesses were recorded in the financial statements
at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition dates.
34 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Current Year
Throughout 2005, the Company completed several small
tuck-in acquisitions, primarily in the pest control and lawn care
businesses. Additionally, in the third
quarter of 2005, ServiceMaster Clean acquired a distributorship. The net purchase price of the 2005
acquisitions was $51 million. The
Company recorded goodwill of approximately $36 million and other intangible
assets of $15 million related to the 2005 acquisitions. The impact of these acquisitions was not
material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.  
In February 2006, the Company announced an agreement to
acquire InStar Services Group, Inc.
Instar is a leading direct provider of commercial disaster response and
reconstruction services in the United States with 2005 revenues of
approximately $130 million. Instar
provides a continuum of services, from planning prior to an event, to emergency
response following the event and continuing service through cleaning, recovery
and reconstruction. The InStar
acquisition is not significant to the Companys consolidated financial
statements, therefore proforma financial information has not been presented.
Prior Years 
During 2004, the Company acquired the assets of

the 2004 acquisitions was $59 million.
The Company recorded goodwill of approximately $52 million and other
intangible assets of $10 million related to the 2004 acquisitions.
During 2003, the Company acquired several small
companies, primarily in the lawn care business. The net purchase price of these acquisitions was $38
million. The Company recorded goodwill
of $38 million and other intangible assets of $4 million related to these
acquisitions.

Held Pending Sale and Discontinued Operations
Current Year
The
Company intends to sell its American Residential Services ARS and American
Mechanical Services AMS companies so it can concentrate resources on its main
growth businesses. The Company has
retained an investment banking firm to serve as its financial advisor in this
process. The ARS/AMS operations provide
heating, ventilation, air conditioning HVAC, plumbing and electrical
installation and repair services and were previously disclosed as the Companys
ARS/AMS segment. Because the Company
intends to sell these companies, the results of these operations are reported
within the financial statement caption businesses held pending sale and
discontinued operations for all periods. 2003 Dispositions
During the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold
substantially all of the assets and related operational obligations of Trees,
Inc., the utility line clearing operations of TruGreen LandCare, to an
independent subsidiary of Asplundh Subsidiary Holdings, Inc., for approximately
$20 million in cash. The impact of the
sale was not material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for
2003.

previously sold international pest control operations. The remaining obligations primarily relate
to long-term self-insurance claims. The
Company believes that the remaining reserves continue to be adequate and
reasonable.

Commitments and Contingencies
The Company leases certain property and equipment under
various operating lease arrangements.
Most of the property leases provide that the Company pay taxes,
insurance and maintenance applicable to the leased premises. As leases for existing locations expire, the
Company expects to renew the leases or substitute another location and
lease. 
Rental expense for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $163 million 147 million and $135 million, respectively.
Future long-term non-cancelable operating lease payments are
approximately $80 million in 2006, $64 million in 2007, $49 million in 2008 37 million in 2009, $21 million in 2010, and $26 million in 2011 and
thereafter.
The majority of the Companys fleet and some equipment
are leased through operating leases.
Lease terms are non-cancelable for the first twelve month term and then
are month-to-month leases, cancelable at the Companys option. There are residual value guarantees ranging
from 70 percent to 87 percent depending on the agreement on these vehicles and
equipment, which historically have not resulted in significant net payments to
the lessors. There are no net payments
reflected in the future minimum lease obligation as the leases are cancelable
and there are no expected net payments due under the guarantees. At December 31, 2005 there was approximately
$259 million of residual value guarantee relating to the Companys fleet and
equipment leases. The fair value of the
assets under the leases is expected to fully mitigate the Companys obligations
under the agreements. 
The Company maintains operating lease facilities with
banks totaling $68 million which provide for the financing of branch properties
to be leased by the Company. At
December 31, 2005, approximately $68 million was funded under these
facilities. Approximately $15 million
of these leases have been included on the balance sheet as assets with related
debt as of December 31, 2005. The
balance of the funded amount is treated as operating leases. Approximately $15 million of the total
facility expires in January 2008 and $53 million expires in September
2009. The Company has guaranteed the
residual value of the properties under the leases up to 82 percent of the fair
market value at the commencement of the lease.
At December 31, 2005, the Companys residual value guarantee related to
the leased assets totaled $56 million for which the Company has recorded the
estimated fair value of this guarantee approximately $09 million in the
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  
In the normal course of business, the Company
periodically enters into agreements that incorporate indemnification
provisions. While the maximum amount
which the Company may be exposed under such agreements cannot be estimated, the
Company does not expect these guarantees and indemnifications to have a
material adverse effect on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The Company carries insurance policies on insurable risks
at levels which it believes to be appropriate, including workers compensation,
auto and general liability risks. The Company
has self-insured retention limits and insured layers of excess insurance
coverage above such self-insured retention limits. Accruals for self-insurance losses, termite damage claims in the
Terminix business and warranty claims in the American Home Shield business are
made based on the Companys claims experience and actuarial assumptions. In 2005, Terminix recorded a $10 million
unfavorable correction in estimating prior years termite damage claim
reserves. At December 31, 2005, these
accruals totaled $211 million, with $93 million included in Self-insured
claims and related expenses and $118 million included in Other long-term
obligations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
The Company has certain liabilities with respect to existing or potential
claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings.
The Company accrues for these liabilities when it is probable that
future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. 
In the ordinary course of conducting its business
activities, the Company becomes involved in judicial, administrative and
regulatory proceedings involving both private parties and governmental
authorities. These proceedings include
general and commercial liability actions and a small number of environmental
proceedings. The Company does not
expect any of these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on its
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Employee Benefit Plans
Discretionary contributions to qualified profit sharing
and non-qualified deferred compensation plans were made in the amount of $99
million for 2005, $93 million for 2004 and $46 million for 2003. Under the Employee Share Purchase Plan, the
Company contributed $8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003. These funds defrayed part of the cost of the
shares purchased by employees.
Minority Interest Ownership and Related Parties
The Company continues to have minority investors in Terminix. This minority
ownership reflects an interest
issued to the prior owners of the Allied Bruce Terminix Companies in connection
with the acquisition of that entity. At
any time, the former owners may convert this equity security into eight million
ServiceMaster common shares. The
ServiceMaster shares are included in the shares used in the calculation of
diluted earnings per share, when their inclusion has a dilutive impact. Subsequent to December 31, 2005,
ServiceMaster has the ability to require conversion of the security into
ServiceMaster common shares, provided the closing share price of ServiceMasters
common stock averages at least $15 per share for 40 consecutive trading days.
36 Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements 
Long-Term
Debt Long-term debt includes the following In thousands 2005 2004 845% maturing in 2005 137,499 695% maturing in 2007 49,225 49,225 788% maturing in 2009 179,000 179,000 710% maturing in 2018 79,473 79,473 745% maturing in 2027 195,000 195,000 725% maturing in 2038 82,650 82,650 Other 72,802 82,241 Less current portion 19,222 23,247 Total long-term debt 638,928 781,841 The Company is party to a number of debt agreements
which require it to maintain certain financial and other covenants, including
limitations on indebtedness debt cannot exceed 325 times earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA and a minimum
interest coverage ratio EBITDA needs to exceed four times interest
expense. In addition, under certain
circumstances, the agreements may limit the Companys ability to pay dividends
and repurchase shares of common stock.
These limitations are not expected to be an inhibiting factor in the
Companys future dividend and share repurchase plans. Failure by the Company to maintain these covenants could result
in the acceleration of the maturity of the debt. Throughout 2005, the Company was in compliance with the covenants
related to these debt agreements and, based on its operating outlook for 2006,
expects to be able to maintain compliance in the future. 
The Company does not have any debt agreements that
contain put rights or provide for acceleration of maturity as a result of a
change in credit rating. However, the
Company has a number of debt agreements which contain standard ratings-based pricing
grids where the interest rate payable under the agreement changes if and when
the Companys credit rating changes.
While the Company does not expect a negative change in credit ratings,
the impact on interest expense resulting from any changes in credit ratings is
not expected to be material to the Company. 
Since August 1997, ServiceMaster has issued $11
billion of unsecured debt securities pursuant to registration statements filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
As of December 31, 2005, ServiceMaster had $550 million of senior
unsecured debt securities and equity interests available for issuance under an
effective shelf registration statement. 
The Company has a committed revolving bank credit
facility for up to $500 million that expires in May 2010. The facility can be used for general Company
purposes. As of December 31, 2005, the
Company had issued approximately $142 million of letters of credit under the
facility and had unused commitments of approximately $358 million. There were no borrowings outstanding at that
date. At the Companys current credit
ratings, the interest rate under the facility is LIBOR plus 75 basis
points.  
In December 2003 and January 2004, the Company entered
into interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $165
million. Under the terms of these
agreements, the Company pays a floating rate of interest based on a specified
spread over six-month LIBOR on the notional amount and the Company receives a
fixed rate of interest at 788 percent
on the notional amount. The impact of
these swap transactions was to convert $165 million of the Companys debt from
fixed rate at 788 percent to a variable rate based on LIBOR. In accordance with SFAS 133 Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the Companys interest rate
swap agreements are classified as fair value hedges and, as such, gains and
losses on the swaps as well as the gains and losses on the related hedged items
are recognized in current earnings.  
Cash interest payments were $57 million in 2005, $60
million in 2004 and $61 million in 2003.
Future scheduled long-term debt payments are $19 million in 2006
average rate of 57 percent, $61 million in 2007 average rate of 71 percent 27 million in 2008 average rate of 62 percent, $184 million in 2009
average rate of 81 percent and $8 million in 2010 average rate of 79
percent. In April 2005, $137 million
of the Companys public debt matured and was paid. The Companys next significant debt maturity is not until 2007. Cash and
Marketable Securities 
Cash, money market funds and certificates of deposits,
with maturities of three months or less, are included in the Statements of
Financial Position caption Cash and Cash Equivalents. Marketable securities are designated as
available for sale and recorded at current market value, with unrealized gains
and losses reported in a separate component of shareholders equity. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the
Companys investments consist primarily of domestic publicly traded debt of
$108 million and $109 million, respectively and common equity securities of
$144 million and $131 million, respectively. 
The aggregate market value of the Companys short-term
and long-term investments in debt and equity securities was $252 million and
$240 million and the aggregate cost basis was $246 million and $226 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 
Interest and dividend income received on cash and
marketable securities was $20 million, $15 million, and $13 million, in 2005,
2004, and 2003, respectively. Gains and
losses on sales of investments, as determined on a specific identification
basis, are included in investment income in the period they are realized. The Company periodically reviews its
portfolio of investments to determine whether there has been an other than
temporary decline in the value of the investments from factors such as
deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer or the markets in
which it competes. The unrealized gains
in the investment portfolio were approximately $13 million and $16 million as
of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Unrealized losses were approximately $7 million and $2 million as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
The portion of these unrealized losses older than one year at December
31 was less than $1 million for both 2005 and 2004. The aggregate fair value of the investments with unrealized
losses totaled $133 million and $96 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, and consist primarily of corporate bonds and common equity
securities.  
Receivable
Sales 
The Company has an agreement to provide for the
ongoing revolving sale of a designated pool of accounts receivable of TruGreen
ChemLawn and Terminix to a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary,
ServiceMaster Funding LLC. 
37 Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements 
ServiceMaster Funding LLC has entered into an
agreement to transfer, on a revolving basis, an undivided percentage ownership
interest in a pool of accounts receivable to unrelated third party
purchasers. ServiceMaster Funding LLC
retains an undivided percentage interest in the pool of accounts receivable and
bad debt losses for the entire pool are allocated first to this retained
interest. During 2005, 2004 and 2003,
there were no receivables sold to third parties under this agreement. However, the Company may sell its
receivables in the future which would provide an alternative funding source. The agreement is a 364-day facility that is
renewable at the option of the purchasers.
The Company may sell up to $70 million of its receivables to these
purchasers and therefore has immediate access to cash proceeds from these
sales. The amount of the eligible
receivables varies during the year based on seasonality of the business and
will at times limit the amount available to the Company.

Equity 
The Company has authorized one billion shares of
common stock with par value of $01. In
February 2006, the Company announced the declaration of a cash dividend of $11
per share payable on February 28, 2006 to shareholders of record on February
17, 2006.  
The Company has an effective shelf registration
statement to issue shares of common stock in connection with future,
unidentified acquisitions. This
registration statement allows the Company to issue registered shares much more
efficiently when acquiring privately held companies. The Company plans to use the shares over time in connection with
purchases of small acquisitions. There
were approximately 43 million shares available for issuance under this
registration statement at December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, there were 32 million Company
shares available for issuance upon the exercise of employee stock options outstanding and future
grants. Stock options are issued at a
price not less than the fair market value on the grant date and expire within
ten years of the grant date. Certain
options may permit the holder to pay the option exercise price by tendering
Company shares that have been owned by the holder without restriction for an
extended period. Share grants and
restricted stock awards carry a vesting period and are restricted as to the
sale or transfer of the shares.
Restricted stock awards are non-transferable and subject to forfeiture
if the holder does not remain continuously employed by the Company during the
vesting period, or if the restricted stock is subject to performance measures,
if those performance measures are not attained. The Company includes the vested and unvested portions of the
restricted stock awards in shares outstanding in the denominator of its
earnings per share calculations. 
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 revised
2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R.
SFAS 123R replaces SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS 123, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. SFAS 123R requires that
stock options and share grants be recorded at fair value and this value is
recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period. The Statement requires that compensation
expense be recorded for newly issued awards as well as the unvested portion of
previously issued awards that remain outstanding as of the adoption of this
Statement.  The requirements of SFAS
123R become effective beginning with the Companys 2006 fiscal year January
1, 2006. The Company had previously
disclosed that it had expected to restate prior periods as if the Statement
were in effect for all periods. As
permitted by this Statement, the Company will instead prospectively apply the
provisions of this Statement effective January 1, 2006. 
In the first quarter of 2003, the Company adopted SFAS
123 and has been expensing the fair value of new employee option grants awarded
subsequent to 2002 using the prospective method as described in SFAS 148, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123. 
Beginning in 2005, the fair value of each option award
was estimated on the date of the grant using a lattice-based option valuation
model. Prior to 2005, the Company used
the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This change was made in order to
provide a better estimate of fair value, as the lattice-based model reflects
the impact of stock price changes on exercise behavior, and changes in
volatility and interest rates. 
Under the lattice-based model, expected volatilities
are based on a term structure of implied volatilities from traded options on
the Companys stock and historical volatility of the Companys stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate
option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted is
derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period
of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The range of
risk-free rates for periods within the contractual life of the options is based
on the U.S. Treasury forward curve rate and uses a term structure. 
38 Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements 
The lattice-based model used the following assumption
for options awarded in 2005: range of expected volatility 2766 percent to
4756 percent; weighted-average volatility of 2824 percent; expected life in
years of 6; dividend yield of 341 percent; risk-free rate in the range of
298 percent to 465 percent; and the weighted-average risk-free rate of 406
percent. 
For awards valued using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model, the computation of fair value was based on the
following weighted-average assumptions in 2004 and 2003: risk-free rates of 37 percent and 36 percent,
respectively; dividend yields of 40 percent and 42 percent, respectively; share price volatility of 306 percent
and 308 percent, respectively;
and average expected lives of six to seven years. The Company has estimated the value of
these options assuming a single weighted-average expected life for the entire award.

Per Share 
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing
income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of
shares outstanding for the period. The
weighted average common shares for the diluted earnings per share calculation
includes the incremental effect related to outstanding options and stock
appreciation rights SARS whose market price is in excess of the grant
price. Shares potentially issuable
under convertible securities have been considered outstanding for purposes of
the diluted earnings per share calculations.
In computing diluted earnings per share, the after-tax interest expense
related to convertible securities is added back to net income in the numerator,
while the diluted shares in the denominator include the shares issuable upon
conversion of the securities. Due to
the losses incurred in 2003, the denominator does not include the effects of
options as it would result in a less dilutive computation. As a result, 2003 diluted earnings per share
are the same as basic earnings per share.
Had the Company recognized income from continuing operations in 2003,
incremental shares attributable to the assumed exercise of outstanding options
would have increased diluted shares outstanding by 39 million shares. Shares potentially issuable under
convertible securities have not been considered outstanding for 2005 and 2003
as their inclusion results in a less dilutive computation. Had the inclusion of convertible securities
not resulted in a less dilutive computation in both 2005 and 2003, incremental
shares attributable to the assumed conversion of the securities would have

of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The
ServiceMaster Company 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated
statements of financial position of The ServiceMaster Company and subsidiaries
the Company as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
ServiceMaster Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated February 27, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements
assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. s/ Deloitte Touche LLP

Company intends to sell its American Residential Services ARS and American
Mechanical Services AMS companies so that it can concentrate resources on
its main growth businesses. These
operations were previously disclosed as the Companys ARS/AMS segment. Because the Company intends to sell these
companies, the results of these operations are classified within the
financial statement caption businesses held pending sale and discontinued
operations in all periods. See the
Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of
Operations for a discussion of the components of businesses held pending sale
and discontinued operations. 2 In
January 2005, the Company announced that it had reached a comprehensive
agreement with the Internal Revenue Service regarding its examination of the
Companys federal income taxes through the year 2002. As a result of this agreement, the Company
recorded a non-cash reduction in its fourth quarter and full year 2004 tax
provision, thereby increasing net income by approximately $159 million. Approximately $150 million related to
continuing operations $49 per diluted share and $9 million related to
businesses held pending sale and discontinued operations $03 per diluted
share. See the Income Taxes note
in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 3 In
accordance with SFAS 142, the Companys goodwill and intangible assets that
are not amortized are subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment
by applying a fair-value based test. In
the third quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge
associated with the goodwill and intangible assets at its TruGreen LandCare
business unit. This charge, which is
included in the results of continuing operations for 2003, totaled $189
million pre-tax, $156 million after-tax, and $53 per diluted share. Also in the third quarter of 2003, the
Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge associated with the goodwill
and intangible assets at its American Residential Services ARS and American
Mechanical Services AMS operations.
The Company is currently holding these operations for sale,
accordingly, the financial results for the ARS and AMS operations, as well as
the impairment charge related to these operations $292 million pre-tax, $227
million after-tax, are classified as businesses held pending sale and
discontinued operations for all periods.

Effectiveness of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
ServiceMasters Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jonathan P. Ward, and
ServiceMasters President and Chief Financial Officer, Ernest J. Mrozek, have
evaluated ServiceMasters disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of
the period covered by this Form 10-K.
ServiceMasters disclosure controls and procedures include a roll-up of
financial and non-financial reporting that is consolidated in the principal
executive office of ServiceMaster in Downers Grove, Illinois. The reporting process is designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by ServiceMaster in the reports that
it files with or submits to the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms. Messrs. Ward and Mrozek have concluded that both the design and
operation of ServiceMasters disclosure controls and procedures are
effective. 
See Managements Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting in Item 8.
Changes in
Internal Control over Financial Reporting. No change in ServiceMasters internal control over
financial reporting occurred during the fourth quarter of 2005 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
ServiceMasters internal control over financial reporting.
Management Certifications. In June 2005, the
Company submitted to the New York Stock Exchange the Annual CEO Certification
required by Section 303A12a of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company
Manual. The Company has also filed, as
exhibits to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2005, the certifications of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
