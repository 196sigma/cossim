Financial Statement Schedule:
Schedule II -- Valuation and Qualifying Accounts for the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999.. 51   All other schedules are omitted because they are not required, are not
applicable, or the information is included in the consolidated financial
statements or notes thereto.                    25              Independent Auditors' Report To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cylink Corporation   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cylink
Corporation and subsidiaries Company as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and
comprehensive loss and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2001. Our audits also included the consolidated financial
statement schedule listed in Item 14a2 for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements and the financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and the
financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31,
2001 and 2000, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also,
in our opinion, such consolidated financial statement schedule for the years
ended December 31, 2001 2000, and 1999, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2001 have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as
a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the
Company recurring net losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to
continue as a going concern. Management plans concerning these matters are
also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1. The Company and a Summary of its Significant Accounting Policies
The Company
Cylink Corporation the Company develops, manufactures, markets and
supports a comprehensive portfolio of hardware and software security products
for mission-critical private networks and business communications over the
Internet. The Company products are incorporated into local area networks
LANs and wide area networks WANs, including Virtual Private Networks VPNs
that use the Internet.
Basis of presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern
basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of
liablilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the financial
statements, the Company has incurred losses from continuing operations of $20
million in 2001 and $35 million in 2000, and its cash balances have declined
from $153 million as of December 31, 2000 to $96 million as of December 31,
2001. These factors among others indicate that the Company may be unable to
continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as
a going concern. To address these issues, the Company effected significant cost
cutting measures beginning in the fourth quarter of 2000, and continuing into
2001, including staff reductions and field office consolidations, divestiture of
unprofitable operations and has planned to sublease a portion of its corporate
headquarters facility. Management believes the Company will be able to continue
operations by the successful implementation of its plan to increase revenue,
continue to reduce its cost structure, maximize return on investments in
non-core areas of the business, and ultimately attain profitable operations. In
addition, the Company may seek debt or equity financing if required, however, no
assurances can be given that the Company will attain profitable operations or
that additional financing would be available.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles  generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.  These estimates include allowances for doubtful  receivables,
inventory write-downs, warranty costs, and valuation allowance on deferred
assets.
Foreign currency
The functional currency of the Company Israeli operations which were
divested in 2001 is the U.S. dollar. The functional currencies of the Company
other foreign operations are the local currencies. The effects of translating
the financial position and results of operations of local functional currency
operations are included as a component of other comprehensive income. The
effects of foreign currency transactions and of remeasuring the financial
position and results of Israeli operations into the functional currency are
included in the statements of operations. Net gains and losses from foreign
currency transactions were not significant during any of the periods presented.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investment instruments
with a maturity at the time of purchase of three months or less.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates
actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis or market.                    31                Cylink Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Continued
Restricted cash
Restricted cash consists of certificates of deposit, which are restricted
from use pursuant to an operating lease obligation Note 16.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
generally three-to-five years.  Amortization of leasehold improvements is
computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful
lives of the assets or the remaining lease term. Beginning in 1999, computer
software for internal use is capitalized in accordance with the guidelines of
Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use issued by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants AICPA.
Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles
Goodwill and other intangibles are being amortized on a straight-line basis
over three to seven years. Accumulated amortization relating to goodwill and
other intangibles was $43 million and $94 million at December 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively. Intangible assets consist of acquired technology of $98
million net, goodwill of $59 million net and other intangibles $09 million
net acquired in the Celotek acquisition see Note 4. Approximately, $05
million in goodwill and other intangibles was written off in the divestiture of
ARL See Note 5.
Impairment of long-lived assets
The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of all long-lived
assets, including the related amortization period, whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be
recoverable. The Company determines whether there has been an impairment by
comparing the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows to the related
asset carrying value. If an asset is considered impaired, the asset is written
down to its estimated fair value.
Revenue recognition
The Company revenue is derived primarily from sales of commercial network
security products, and to a lesser extent, from the license of software products
and from professional services, including customer support and consulting. Fees
for maintenance and support services of hardware products are charged separately
from product revenue. Revenues derived from the sale or license of the Company
products are recognized in accordance with the applicable accounting standards,
including Statement of Position No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as
amended. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement
exists, such as receipt of a contract or purchase order, the product has been
shipped, the sales price is fixed and determinable, collection is probable, and
vendor-specific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee
to any undelivered elements of the arrangement. Such undelivered elements
typically consist of maintenance and support, which are deferred and amortized
over the applicable period. Vendor specific objective evidence of the value of
maintenance and support is generally based on the annual renewal rate.
Concurrent with sales, a provision is made for estimated costs to repair or
replace products under warranty arrangements. Consulting revenues, which to date
have been immaterial, are recognized on a time-and-materials or percentage of
completion basis in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Research
Bulletin-45, Long-Term Construction-Type Contracts, and Statement of Position
81-1,  Accounting  for  Performance  of  Construction-type  and  Certain
Production-type Contracts depending on the contract.
Research and development
Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred.
32                Cylink Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Continued
From time-to-time, the Company performs research and development under
several government funded arrangements. There were no such funded arrangements
in 2001 and 2000. These contracts provide funding irrespective of the results
for research and development of certain cryptographic technologies. Amounts
received under these contracts are offset against research and development
expenses.
The Company performed research and development under several other research
and development contracts during 2001, 2000, and 1999, which provide for the
development and licensing of technology in exchange for development funding. The
Company recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses $01
million, $02 million and $15 million under such arrangements in the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.
Software Development Costs
Software development costs are included in research and development and are
expensed as incurred. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86 SFAS
86 requires the capitalization of certain development costs of software to be
sold once technological feasibility is established, which the Company defines as
completion of a working model. The capitalized cost is then amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated product life, or on the ratio of current
revenues to total projected product revenues, whichever is greater. To date, the
period between achieving technological feasibility and the general availability
of such software has been short and software development costs qualifying for
capitalization have been insignificant. Accordingly, the Company has not
capitalized any software development costs under SFAS 86.
Stock-based compensation
The Company accounts for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value
method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. The Company provides
additional pro forma disclosures as required under SFAS 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation See Note 10.
Income taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax
consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their financial  statement reported amounts. A valuation
allowance is required to reduce net deferred tax assets to amounts that are more
likely than not to be realized.
Earnings loss per share
Basic earnings loss per share is based on the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding, excluding shares in escrow related to acquisitions
Note 4. Diluted earnings loss per share is based on the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares
outstanding excluding contingent shares held in escrow. The Company only
potentially dilutive securities are stock options See Note 10. All potentially
dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings
per share, as their effect is anti-dilutive on the loss from continuing
operations for all periods presented.
Concentrations of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, and to a lesser extent, currency fluctuation of balances
denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar. The Company                    33                Cylink Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Continued
performs on-going credit evaluations and maintains reserves for estimated
potential credit losses. The Company minimizes the amount of cash it maintains
in local currencies by maintaining excess cash in United States dollars.
No customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2001. One customer accounted for 13% of revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and one customer for 11% of revenue for the year ended
December 31, 1999.
Fair value of financial instruments
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value
based on the short-term nature of these instruments. The recorded amount of
long-term debt approximates fair value as the actual interest rates approximate
current competitive rates.
Dependence on suppliers
The Company ability to timely deliver its products is dependent upon the
availability of quality components and subsystems used in these products. The
Company depends in part upon subcontractors to manufacture, assemble and deliver
certain items in a timely and satisfactory manner. The Company obtains certain
components and subsystems from single, or a limited number of sources. A
significant interruption in the delivery of such items could have a material
adverse effect on the Company financial condition and results of operations.
Comprehensive income loss
Comprehensive income loss includes all changes in equity net assets
during a period from nonowner sources. Examples of items to be included in
comprehensive income, which are excluded from net income loss, include foreign
currency translation adjustments and unrealized gain/loss on available-for-sale
securities. The Company has presented comprehensive income loss for each
period presented within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the financial statements in
order to conform to the 2001 presentation. These reclassifications did not have
any effect on net income loss or on shareholders' equity.
Recently issued accounting standards
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Accounting for Business Combinations
SFAS No. 141. SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations be
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the
pooling-of-interests method for business combinations initiated after June 30,
2001. During 2000, the Company sole business combinations were accounted for
by using the purchase method of accounting, and there were no acquisitions
during 2001. In accordance with its adoption of SFAS No. 141, the Company will
use the purchase method of accounting for its business combinations. The Company
does not expect this statement to have a material  impact on Cylink
consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. SFAS No. 142 changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization
method to an impairment-only approach. Amortization of goodwill, including
goodwill recorded in past business combinations, will cease upon adoption of
this statement. In addition, this statement requires that goodwill be tested
for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. The Company
implemented SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002.                    34                Cylink Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Continued
In accordance with this statement,  Cylink is required to complete the
transitional goodwill impairment test by June 30, 2002. The Company is
evaluating but has not yet determined whether adoption of this statement will
result in an impairment of goodwill. Management estimates that goodwill and
indefinite lived intangible  asset  amortization  required under previous
accounting standards of $10 million pre- and post-tax will not be charged to
the income statement in 2002.
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial  Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations SFAS No. 143. SFAS No. 143 covers all legally enforceable
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and
provides the accounting and reporting requirements for such obligations. SFAS
No. 143 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2003. Management has
not yet determined the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 143 will have on
the Company consolidated financial statements.
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. This statement supercedes SFAS No.
121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of. The statement retains the previously existing
accounting requirements related to the recognition and measurement of the
impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used while expanding the
measurement requirements of long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale to
include discontinued operations. It also expands the previously existing
reporting requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an
entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale. SFAS
No. 144 is effective for the company as of January 1, 2002 and management does
not expect this statement to have a material impact on its consolidated
financial position or results of operations.
2. Gain on Disposal of Discontinued Operations
On March 28, 1998, the Company sold its Wireless Group to P-Com for $581
million $460 million in cash and an unsecured note in the amount of $121
million. The sale resulted in an after tax gain of approximately $228 million
in 1998. After the elimination of other claims by Cylink against P-Com and the
offset of certain reserves against those assets, Cylink recorded an additional
$23 million after-tax gain on disposal of discontinued operations in 1999.
3. Restructuring Charges
In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a $14 million charge
to accrue for losses relative to the estimated costs of excess leased facilities
and related furniture and equipment, net of estimated proceeds from planned
subleasing of excess office space in Santa Clara. The resulting restructuring
reserve of $14 million is included in accrued liabilities and other accruals on
the accompanying balance sheet as none of the reserve was paid out as of
December 31, 2001. In the second, third and fourth quarters of 2001, the Company
initiated workforce reductions affecting a total of 79 employees incurring a
total of $06 million in severance charges which was fully paid during 2001.
On October 30, 2000 the company announced a restructuring in order to
streamline  operations and reduce costs. The Company initiated workforce
reductions of 36 employees incurring severance costs of $05 million before
taxes fully paid during 2000 and pre-tax lease cancellation costs of $03
million accrued at December 31, 2000.
4. Acquisitions
Celotek
On August 30, 2000, Cylink acquired all the outstanding shares of Celotek,
a developer of high-performance Asynchronous Transfer Mode network security
appliances. The Company exchanged                    35                Cylink Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Continued
1,590,137 shares of common stock with a fair value of $22,386,000 and cash of
$515,000 for all the outstanding shares of Celotek. In addition, the Company
converted outstanding options to purchase Celotek common stock into options to
purchase 307,500 shares of common stock of the Company with an aggregate fair
value of $2,329,000. The fair value of these options were determined using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected life
of 29 years, risk-free interest rate of 600%, volatility of 80% and no
dividends during the expected term. The total purchase price was $26,500,000,
which included transaction costs of $1,270,000, a portion of which was satisfied
through the issuance of 33,728 shares of Cylink common stock.
In addition, during 2001, 40,913 shares were issued to former employees of
Celotek who were employed by Cylink for twelve months following the date of
acquisition. The fair value $545,000 of these shares was amortized to
compensation  expense over the twelve month vesting term  following the
acquisition date.
Of the total shares issued under the agreement, 241,572 shares of common
stock, held in escrow as collateral for general representations and warranties
made by Celotek under the agreement, were released after a period of one year
from the closing.
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition were as follows
in thousands  Current assets including cash and cash equivalents of $253   $ 2,429
Property and equipment     1,059
Acquired technology     12,077
In-process technology     3,681
Goodwill     7,225
Other intangibles     1,403
Current liabilities     1,189
Long-term debt assumed      185
$ 26,500
The allocation of the purchase price to the respective intangible assets
was based on management estimates of the after-tax cash flows. This allocation
gave explicit consideration to the Securities and Exchange Commission view on
purchased in-process research and development as set forth in its September 9,
1998 letter to the American Institute of Certified Public  Accountants.
Management estimates gave consideration to the following: i the employment
of a fair market value premise excluding any Company-specific considerations
that could result in estimates of investment value for the subject assets; ii
comprehensive due diligence concerning all potential intangible assets; iii
the determination that none of the technology development had been completed at
the time of the acquisition; and iv the allocation to in-process research and
development based on a calculation that considered the present value of the
operating income that would have been generated by the in process research and
development  project that is attributable to the acquired technology if
successfully completed.
The Company allocated $37 million to acquired in-process research and
development that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of the
transaction. The acquired in-process research and development was approximately
80% complete towards development of a reduced cost asynchronous transfer mode
encryptor. The primary remaining efforts associated with the development of the
technology included several key areas. The key areas were completing the
hardware and electronics necessary to make the product functional and shock and
heat testing. The Company incurred approximately 27 person months of additional
development since acquisition and completed the initial development of the
technology in November 2000.
The values assigned to acquired in process research and development was
determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased  in-process
technology into a commercially viable product, estimating                    36                Cylink Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Continued
the resulting net cash flows from the product and discounting the net cash flows
to their present value. The revenue projections used to value the acquired
in-process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market
sizes, growth factors, expected trends in technology and other factors.
Operating expenses were estimated based on historical results and anticipated
profit margins.
The rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value
were based on cost of capital calculations. Due to the nature of the forecast
and risks associated with the projected  growth,  profitability and the
developmental nature of the product an after-tax discount rate of 30% was used
to value the in process research and development.
The discount rate was commensurate with the stage of development and the
uncertainties in the economic estimates described above. If the acquired
in-process research and development product is not commercially successful, the
Company business, operating results and financial condition may be materially
adversely affected in future periods. In addition, the value of other intangible
assets acquired may be impaired.
The following unaudited pro forma information shows the results of
operations for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, as if
the Celotek acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period
presented and at the purchase price established in October 2000 in thousands,

On July 21, 1999, Cylink acquired Virginia-based SDI, a security consulting
and  professional  services  company that provide  network  vulnerability
assessments. Concurrent with the acquisition, Cylink entered into employment
contracts with four SDI shareholders. In connection with the acquisition and
employment agreements, Cylink 1 paid cash of $572,000 including $122,000 of
transaction costs, 2 issued 306,402 shares of Cylink common shares valued at
$17 million into escrow, to be released in annual installments as the shares
vest over a three-year employment period, 3 issued options to purchase 150,000
of Cylink common shares at $384 per share, which vest over four years of
continued employment, and 4 agreed to pay bonuses of up to $1925 million
contingent upon continued employment and the achievement of specified revenue
and profitability goals during the following three years. Deferred compensation
resulting from the issuance of the escrowed common shares and the stock options
totaled $2034 million and is reported as a reduction to shareholders' equity,
to be amortized over the applicable vesting period. The acquisition was recorded
using the purchase method, and the goodwill arising from the transaction
$436,000 is being amortized over three years. The results of operations of SDI
are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date
of acquisition through the date of sale. Revenues from SDI were insignificant in
comparison to Cylink consolidated revenues during 1999.
On April 9, 2001, Cylink Corporation sold SDI to a private company. Of the
original consideration enumerated above, 1 120,762 shares of the 306,402
shares issued to escrow were returned to the Company and cancelled, as SDI was
divested prior to the three year holding period contemplated by the original
purchase agreement. 2 98,926 options of the original 150,000 options to
acquire Cylink common shares were cancelled unvested, and 3 no bonuses were
paid during the ownership period due to the failure of SDI to achieve its
financial goals. The remaining unamortized deferred compensation of                    37                Cylink Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Continued 157,000 relating to the options issued and $546,000 relating to the escrowed
shares was reversed to additional paid-in-capital at the time of the sale, as
SDI was divested prior to the three year holding period contemplated by the
original purchase agreement.
5. Divestitures
On April 9, 2001, the Company sold SDI to a private company in exchange for
209,425 shares of Series C preferred stock representing a minority interest in
that company see Note 4. No gain or loss was recorded on the transaction. The
Company evaluated the carrying value of its investment in the preferred shares
of that private company at December 31, 2001, and recorded a charge for
impairment of the value of that investment in the amount of $03 million.
On June 22, 2001, the Company announced that it would close or sell its
Israeli subsidiary, Algorithmic Research, Ltd. ARL. The Company recorded a
$25 million charge during the second quarter of 2001, resulting from the
write-down of assets associated with the wind-up of that subsidiary. On August
9, 2001, Cylink executed an Allotment and Conversion Agreement and various
related documents collectively the ARL Divestiture, under which Cylink
effectively transferred ownership in ARL to ARL existing employees. More
specifically, Cylink transferred an 81% ownership in ARL to a trustee acting on
behalf of ARL existing employees, and converted its remaining minority
interest and its intercompany debt of approximately $131 million to preferred
stock of ARL having certain rights and privileges in the event of ARL sale or
liquidation. The fair value of these preferred shares was considered to be nil
and accordingly, no value has been assigned to Cylink ownership interest in
the preferred stock. As part of the ARL Divestiture, Cylink paid $15 million,
and forgave an additional $145 million in intercompany debt, for sale of ARL
virtual private networking technology, a royalty free, irrevocable license to
ARL remaining base of existing intellectual property solely for incorporating
into Cylink Products, and a release and waiver from all of ARL existing
employees. Cylink also agreed to assign certain contracts to ARL concerning
licenses of ARL products, and to wind up ARL subsidiaries' operations in
Germany and Singapore. Under the ARL Divestiture, ARL will retain ownership and
responsibility for all of its other assets and liabilities. The Company incurred
an additional $03 million loss in connection with the divestiture during the
third quarter of 2001.
6. Working Capital Loan
On June 27, 2001, Cylink entered into a loan and security agreement with a
bank under which it may borrow up to $75 million by way of revolving advances.
The loan is secured by all of Cylink tangible assets and contains a covenant
to maintain a minimum tangible net worth. The Company was in compliance with its
financial covenant at December 31, 2001, but breached it covenant in February
2002. The revolving loan provides for loan advances up to 80% of Cylink
eligible accounts receivable, bears interest at a rate 175% above the Bank
prime rate of interest prime was 475% as of December 31, 2001 and is due June
27, 2002. Cylink paid a commitment fee of $008 million at the inception of the
loan which is being amortized over its one-year term. There have been no
advances made under the loan since its inception.
As a result of the acquisition of Celotek, Cylink acquired an equipment
line of credit for up to $2 million. This line matures December 1, 2002 and
bears interest at the prime rate plus 1%. As of December 31, 2001, borrowings
under the equipment line were $139,000. The equipment line requires the Company
to maintain certain liquidity and profitability covenants, with which the
Company was not in compliance. Accordingly all amounts outstanding at December
31, 2001 have been classified as short term.                    38                Cylink Corporation

9. Preferred stock
In connection with the Company initial public offering in 1996, the Board
of Directors authorized the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of undesignated
preferred stock and the Board has the authority to issue the undesignated
preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions thereof. No preferred stock had been issued as of

10. Stock option plans
The Company has three stock option plans: the 1994 Flexible Stock Incentive
Plan which was the successor plan to the 1987 plan 1994 Plan, the Cylink ATM
Technology Center 2000 Stock Option Plan 2000 Plan, and the Cylink
Corporation 2001 Non-Qualified Stock Incentive Plan 2001 Plan. The 1994 Plan
provides for the grant of incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options
to executives, employees and consultants to purchase up to 8,050,000 Common
Shares. Stock options may be granted at prices not less than 100% and 85% for
incentive and nonqualified stock options, respectively, of the fair market value
of the stock on the date of grant. Through December 31, 2001, all nonqualified
stock options have been granted at or above 100% of the fair market value of the
stock on the date of grant. Options granted under the 1994 Plan are exercisable
at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Board of Directors,
and generally vest over four years. Options generally expire six years from the
date of grant.
The Company adopted the 2000 Plan in conjunction with the acquisition of
Celotek Corporation in 2000. The 2000 Plan provides for the grant of incentive
stock options and nonqualified stock options to executives, employees and
consultants to purchase up to 300,000 Cylink Common Shares.
The Company adopted the 2001 Plan in September 2001. The 2001 Plan provides
for the grant of nonqualified stock options to executives, employees and
consultants to purchase up to 2,000,000 Cylink Common Shares.                    41                Cylink Corporation

Pro forma stock compensation disclosures
The estimated grant date fair value disclosed by the Company is calculated
using the Black-Scholes model. The Black-Scholes model, as well as other
currently accepted option valuation models, was                    42                Cylink Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Continued
developed to estimate the fair value of freely tradable, fully transferable
options without vesting restrictions, which significantly differ from the
Company stock option awards. These models also require highly subjective
assumptions, including future stock price volatility and expected time until
exercise, which greatly affect the calculated grant date fair value.
The following weighted average assumptions are included in the estimated
grant date fair value calculations for the Company stock option awards under

In January 2000, Cylink adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan that makes
available shares of the Company common stock for full time employees of the
Company to purchase at a discount to the open market price through a payroll
deduction plan. From its adoption through December 31, 2001, 526,800 shares have
been made available for purchase under the Plan. Employee contributions were
limited to 12% of their base compensation during the initial five-month offering
period and 10% of their base compensation during each subsequent six-month
offering period, subject to an overall limitation of $25,000 per year. Employee
contributions that are accumulated during the offering period are used to
purchase Cylink Common Stock at the end of the offering period at a 15% discount
to the lower of the Cylink market prices at the first day and the last day of
the offering period.
12. 401K Plan
U.S. employees may participate in the The Cylink Corporation 401k Savings
and Retirement Plan, which was established as a supplemental retirement program.
Beginning May 1, 1987, enrollment in the 401k Plan is automatic for employees
who meet eligibility requirements unless they decline participation. Under the
401K Plan program, Cylink matches contributions by employees up at the rate of
100% of an employee annual compensation to a maximum of $1,00000 per year.
Cylink expense related to the 401k Plan was $02 million in 2001, $03 million
in 2000 and nil in 1999.
13. Notes Receivable From Employees or Former Employees
During 1997, 1998 and 1999, the Company made loans to certain of its
officers towards the purchase of their principal residences. Some of these
officers are no longer employed by the Company. The notes are generally
interest free and are secured by deeds of trust on the related residences. The
Company has                    43                Cylink Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Continued
imputed interest on the notes based on an assumed interest rate of 8% per annum.
One of the notes, with a face value of $558,500 was collected in full on
September 20, 2001. Another of the notes, with a face amount of $14 million,
was collected in full in December 2000. The remaining notes are carried at their
discounted value, which aggregated $20 million at December 31, 2001. As of
December 31, 2001, the remaining unamortized discount on the notes was $01
million. The notes mature as follows: $10 million in 2002, and $11 million in
2004.
14. Contingencies
Securities Class Action.
In 1998, we filed amended Forms 10-Q for the first and second quarters of
1998 and an amended Form 10K for 1997, reflecting restated financial results for
those quarters, and for the fourth quarter of 1997. Between November 6, 1998 and
December 14, 1998, several securities class action complaints were filed against
us and certain of our current and former directors and officers in federal
courts in California. These complaints allege, among other things, that our
previously issued financial statements were materially false and misleading and
that the defendants knew or should have known that these financial statements
caused our common stock price to rise artificially. The actions variously allege
violations of Section 10b of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the
Exchange Act, as amended, and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and
Section 20 of the Exchange Act.
The securities class action lawsuits have been ordered consolidated into a
single action pending in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California, captioned In Re Cylink Securities Litigation, No.
C98-4292 VRW. The action is currently pending before the Court.
We believe we have meritorious defenses and adequate insurance for the
damages claimed in these actions and we intend to defend the Company vigorously.
However, it is not feasible to predict or determine the final outcome of these
proceedings, and if the outcome were to be unfavorable and exceed our applicable
insurance, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of
operations could be materially adversely affected.
Other Litigation
In addition, in the normal course of business, we, from time to time,
receive inquiries or other communication with regard to possible infringement of
third party intellectual property rights by our patents, or the features or
content of certain of our products. We believe it is unlikely that the outcome
of these infringement inquiries will have a material adverse effect on our
financial position or results of operations, however if litigation results from
any of these inquires and the outcome is unfavorable to us, it could have a
material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial
condition.
There has been  substantial  litigation  regarding patent and other
intellectual property rights in the software and network security industry
related industries. Further commercialization of our products could provoke
claims of infringement from third parties. In the future, litigation may be
necessary to enforce our patents, to protect our trade secrets or know-how or to
defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the
scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation
could result in substantial cost and diversion of our efforts, which by itself
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating
results. Further, adverse determinations in such litigation could result in loss
of proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities to third parties,
require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing
or selling our products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition or results of operations.                    44                Cylink Corporation

On February 8, 2002, Cylink received notice from the United States Postal
Service USPS that it was terminating its license to Cylink Net Authority
product as of March 17, 2002, noting that its decision was not a reflection of
the quality of work performance provided by Cylink but was due to USPS'
immediate need to reduce cost and downsize its non core businesses following
the anthrax attack on its                    46                Cylink Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Continued
operations in October of 2001. Revenues from USPS during 2001 amounted to
approximately $20 million. The Company recently granted a continuation of USPS'
license, at its request, through May 30, 2002, but we expect this license and
all further revenue earned under Cylink contract with the USPS to expire in
the second quarter of 2002.  Although the Company continues to explore
alternative sources of funding for our PKI development activity with other
potential OEM customers, any effort to continue development and marketing of
Cylink PKI technology may fail to generate sufficient revenue to cover its
costs if we continue in this business for the balance of 2002.
