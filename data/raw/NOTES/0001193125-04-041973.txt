REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS  The Board of Directors and Shareholders Central European Distribution Corporation  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Central European Distribution Corporation Company and its subsidiaries as of December 31,
2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. The financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2002 and for the two years then ended were audited by other auditors whose report dated March 14, 2003 expressed an
unqualified opinion on those statements.  We conducted our audit in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31,
2003, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  PricewaterhouseCoopers Sp. z o.o. Warsaw, Poland March 11, 2004

CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Monetary amounts in columns expressed in thousands except per share information  1. Organization and Description of Business  Central European Distribution Corporation CEDC, a Delaware Corporation, and its
subsidiaries collectively referred to as the Company operates primarily as a wholesale distributor of fine wines, beers and liquors across Poland. Based in Warsaw and operating through nine distribution centers and 58 satellite branches the
Company offers a 24 hour delivery service of alcoholic beverages to both the on and off trade. Since its incorporation in September 1997 the Company has acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock or 100% of the voting rights of its 12
subsidiaries, a summary of which can be found in note 6 to these financial statements.  The Company through its various subsidiaries derives all its revenues in Poland.  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  The significant accounting policies and practices followed by the Company are as follows:  Basis of Presentation  The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CEDC and its subsidiaries all of which the Company wholly owns or owns 100% of the voting rights. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated
financial statements.  CEDCs subsidiaries maintain their books of account
and prepare their statutory financial statements in Polish Zloties PLN in accordance with Polish statutory requirements and the Accounting Act of 29 September 1994. The subsidiaries financial statements have been adjusted to reflect
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of consolidated
financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates
and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements.  Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions  For all
of the Companys subsidiaries the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. The Income Statements are translated at the average rate of
exchange prevailing during the respective year. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of shareholders equity. Transaction adjustments arising from operations
as well as gains and losses from any specific foreign currency transactions are included in the reported net income for the period.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been presented in U.S. Dollars.  The exchange rates used on Polish zloty denominated transactions and balances for translation purposes as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 for
one U.S. Dollar were 374 PLN and 384 PLN, respectively. As of March 11, 2004 the rate had changed to 391 PLN. 
40 Table of Contents
CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Monetary amounts in columns expressed in thousands except per share information  Tangible Fixed Assets  Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of
tangible fixed assets is computed by the straight-line method over the following useful lives:  Type
Depreciation life in years Transportation equipment under capital leases
5
Transportation equipment not under capital lease
5
Software
2
Computers and IT equipment
3
Beer dispensing and other equipment
210
Freehold land
Not depreciated
Freehold buildings

Leased equipment meeting certain
criteria is capitalized and the present value of the related lease payments is recorded as a liability. Amortization of capitalized leased assets is computed on a straight-line method over the useful life of the relevant assets.  Where equipment costs less than $900 per transaction, it is expensed to the income statement
as incurred.  The Company periodically reviews its investment in tangible fixed
assets and when indicators of impairment exist and if the value of the asset is impaired, an impairment loss is recognized.  Goodwill  As required by FASB 142, acquired goodwill is no longer amortized. Instead the Company assesses the recoverability of its goodwill at least once a year or whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances or
business climate indicate that expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges for business units of a similar economic nature may not be sufficient to support the recorded goodwill. If undiscounted cash flows were to be
insufficient to support the goodwill, an impairment charge would be recognized to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill based on the expected discounted cash flows of the business units. No such charge has been considered necessary through the
date of the accompanying financial statements.  Intangible assets other
than Goodwill  Intangibles consist primarily of acquired trademarks.
The trademarks are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of the expected economic benefits 10 years.  Revenue Recognition  Revenue derived from beverage distribution is recognized when goods are shipped to customers and where a delivery acceptance note signed by the customer has been returned
to the Company. Sales are stated net of turnover related customer discounts, an estimate of customer returns and sales tax VAT. 
41 Table of Contents
CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Monetary amounts in columns expressed in thousands except per share information  Shipping and Handling Costs  Where the Company has incurred costs in shipping goods to its warehouse facilities these
costs are recorded as part of inventory and then to costs of goods sold. Shipping and handling costs associated with distribution are recording in Selling, General and Administrative S,GA costs.  Marketing and Promotion Costs  The Company does not involve itself in direct advertising but manages the marketing and
promotional budgets of suppliers for which it has exclusive distribution rights. Where the Company incurs marketing and promotional costs, which do not have a direct revenue benefit, such costs are charged to selling, general and administrative
expenses as they are incurred.  Accounts Receivable 
Accounts receivables are recorded based on the invoice price, inclusive of VAT sales
tax, and where a delivery note has been signed by the customer and returned to the Company. The allowances for doubtful accounts are based upon the aging of the accounts receivable. The Company makes an allowance based on a sliding scale which
culminates in a 100% provision should the receivable be over one year old. However, where circumstances require, the Company will also make specific provisions for any excess not provided for under the general provision. When a final determination
is delivered to the Company regarding the non-recovery of a receivable, the Company then charges the unrecoverable amount to the accumulated allowance.  Inventories  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market value. Cost includes customs duty where applicable, and all costs associated with bringing the inventory to a condition for sale.
These costs include importation, handling, storage and transportation costs, and exclude rebates received from suppliers, which are reflected as reductions to closing inventory. Inventories are comprised primarily of beer, wine, spirits and
non-alcoholic beverages.  During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company
changed its inventory valuation methodology to better estimate direct costs associated with storage and handling. The impact of the change is discussed in the section Management Discussion and Analysis for years ended December 31, 2002. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents  Short-term investments which have a maturity of three months or less from the date of
purchase are classified as cash equivalents. As at December 31, 2003, approximately $22 million was in U.S Dollars within the Company with the balance being in the accounts of the subsidiaries in accounts denominated in PLN.  Income Taxes and Deferred Taxes  The Company computes and records income taxes in accordance with the liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the accounting and tax basis of the underlying assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are
expected to reverse. 
42 Table of Contents CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Monetary amounts in columns expressed in thousands except per share information 
Employee Retirement Provisions  Under Polish Labor Laws, the Company is required to provide each employee reaching their 65th birthday while employed by the Company with a bonus of one month salary. The Company expenses these amounts when incurred as they do not represent a material
amount in aggregate.  Employee Stock-Based Compensation
At December 31, 2003, the Company has the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan
Incentive Plan under which all stock-based compensation awards are granted to directors, executives, and other employees and to non-employee service providers of the Company. The Incentive Plan is described more fully in Note 13. The
Company accounts for grants to employees under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. For grants to employees, no stock-based employee
compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price at least equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The table presented in Note 13 illustrates the
effect on net income and earnings per share if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation.  Stock-based compensation awards are also granted to non-employee service providers under the
Incentive Plan. The Company accounts for grants to non-employee service providers in accordance with the fair value method FASB Statement No. 123.  Financial Instruments  In November 2002, the Company made the decision to convert nearly all 98% of its non-Polish zloty denominated debt into Polish zloty. This decision was made because the
falling interest rates in Poland versus the costs of hedging instruments no longer justified any perceived benefit of holding non- Polish zloty debt. A consequence of this decision is that from November 2002 the Company no longer uses derivative
financial instruments.  Prior to November 2002, the Company used derivative
financial instruments forward foreign currency contracts to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies in order to reduce the currency risk associated with fluctuating exchange rates. Such contracts were used primarily to hedge certain
foreign denominated obligations. The Companys policy was to maintain hedge coverage only on existing obligations. The derivative instruments were valued at fair value and the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the values of
the related exposures in accordance with SFAS 138 Accounting for Certain Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities. The principal currencies hedged were the U.S. Dollars, and the Euro. The duration of the hedge contract typically did not
exceed six months.  Comprehensive Income / Loss  Comprehensive income / loss is defined as all changes in equity during a period except
those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Comprehensive income / loss includes net income adjusted by, among other items, foreign currency translation adjustments. The foreign translation losses/gains on the
re-measurements from PLN to U.S. dollars are classified separately and are the only component of the accumulated other comprehensive income included in shareholders equity.  Additionally, translation gains and losses with respect to long-term subordinated inter-company loans with the parent company are charged to
other comprehensive gains. No deferred tax benefit has been recorded 
43 Table of Contents CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Monetary amounts in columns expressed in thousands except per share information 
on the comprehensive gains in regards to the long-term inter-company transactions with the parent company, as the
repayment of any equity investment is not anticipated in the foreseeable future.  Segment Reporting  The Company operates in one industry
segment, the distribution of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. These activities are conducted by the Companies subsidiaries in Poland. Substantially all revenues, operating profits and assets relate to this business. CEDC assets excluding
inter-company loans and investments located in the United States of America represent less than 1% of consolidated assets.  Net Income Per Common Share  Net income per common share is calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per share EPS are computed by dividing income
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the year. The stock options and warrants discussed in Note 13 were included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share Note 10.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements  In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51 FIN 46. FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the
characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The disclosure provisions of FIN 46 are
effective for financial statements initially issued after January 31, 2003. Public entities with a variable interest in a variable interest entity created before February 1, 2003 shall apply the consolidation requirements of FIN 46 to that entity no
later than the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. FIN 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. Additionally, in December 2003 the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 46 R FIN 46 R being an update of FASB 46. FIN 46 R must be adopted no later than the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after March 15, 2004. Adoption of FIN 46 and FIN 46 R is not expected to have a
significant impact on the financial statements.  3. Trade Receivables and

4. Income and Deferred Taxes  The Company operates in two tax jurisdictions, Delaware in the United States of America and Poland. All Polish subsidiaries file their own
corporate tax returns as well as account for their own deferred tax assets. The Company does not file a tax return in Delaware based upon its consolidated income, but based on the income statement for transactions occurring in the United States of
America.  Total income tax expense varies from expected income tax expense
computed at Polish statutory rates 28% in 2001, 28% in 2002 and 27% in 2003 as follows:  Year ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Tax at Polish statutory rate 5,539 3,098 1,024 Movements in deferred tax asset valuation allowance primarily due to bad debts 307 134 Effect of brought forward tax losses of acquired subsidiary 155 Effect of relief for dividends paid by subsidiaries 528 Tax rate differential on U.S. tax losses 47 Effect of foreign currency exchange rate change on net deferred tax assets 14 28 40 Effect of changes in tax rates on net deferred tax assets 620 12 Permanent differences 2 13 14 Total income tax expense 5,441 2,764 1,132 Current Polish income tax expense 4,742 3,510 1,527 Deferred Polish income tax benefit / expense, net 913 433 331 Deferred U.S. income tax benefit 214 313 64 Total income tax expense 5,441 2,764 1,132  Total Polish income tax payments or
amounts used as settlements against other statutory liabilities during 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $5,221,000, $3,304,000 and $1,216,000 respectively. CEDC has paid no U.S. income taxes and has losses to carry forward totaling $2,497,000, of which
$859,000 will expire in 2016 and $1,638,000 will expire beyond 2017.  Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets are as follows:  December 31 2003

In December 2003, legislation was enacted which reduced the corporate income tax rates in Poland effective January 1,
2004. The enacted tax rate of 27% was reduced to 19%. This reduced the deferred tax asset by approximately $620,000.  Prior to January 1, 2001, the Company had a policy to permanently reinvest their earnings. As of January 1, 2001, the Company instituted a policy of having all of its
subsidiaries except Carey Agri pay dividends. Management intends to distribute 50% of the earnings from the Polish subsidiaries from 2001. The retained earnings prior to January 1, 2001 are not considered distributable.  No deferred taxes have been recorded for the remaining undistributed earnings as the Company
intends to permanently reinvest these earnings.  The tax liabilities including
corporate income tax, Value Added Tax VAT, social security and other taxes may be subject to examinations by Polish tax authorities for up to five years from the end of the year the tax is payable. CEDCs U.S. federal income tax returns are
also subject to examination by the U.S. tax authorities. As the application of tax laws and regulations, and transactions are susceptible to varying interpretations, amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements could be changed at a
later date upon final determination by the tax authorities.  5. Intangible
Assets other than Goodwill  The acquired trademarks in the amount of
$4,218,000 had accumulated amortization of $1,712,000 and $1,097,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002 respectively.  Estimated aggregate future amortization expense for intangible assets is as follows:  2004 455

The Companys carrying value of
goodwill is approximately $3560 million at December 31, 2003 and is attributable to its only reporting unit wholesale spirit division. The Company has completed its impairment review of goodwill and as a result concluded that there is no
impairment to be recognized at December 31, 2003.  With the adoption SFAS No.
142, the Company ceased amortization of goodwill as of January 1, 2002. Had the Company been accounting for its goodwill under SFAS No. 142 for all periods presented, the Companys net income and earnings per share would have been as follows:

8. Bank Loans and Overdraft Facilities  The Company has banking facilities with six banks which are used to support both the Companys acquisition strategy and its Cash on
Delivery COD vodka purchasing requirements. The credit lines are denominated in various currencies as follows:  December 31 2003

Company secured group facilities with one of Polands leading banks so as to improve cash management throughout the group. This facility was used to consolidate our banking relationship to six banks. This action increased total facilities to
approximately $485 million. The overdraft and short term loan facilities are subject to renewal between April and December 2004 and the Company does not foresee any difficulties in successfully renegotiating them.  During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company made the decision that with domestic Polish
interest rates continuing to fall and the uncertainty on the foreign currency markets that the Companys best interest would be served by transferring approximately 98% of its term debt into Polish denominated debt. The weighted average
interest charge on all bank loans and overdraft facilities was 82% and 74% for December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

9. Lease Obligations 
In November 2000, the Company entered into a non cancelable operating lease, for its main warehouse and office in Warsaw, which stipulated monthly payments of $130,000
for five years, this lease cannot be terminated. In February 2003, the Company renegotiated this lease by signing a seven-year agreement starting from May 1, 2003 at a lower rent of $96,000 per month. The following is a schedule by years of the
future rental payments under the non-cancelable operating lease as of December 31, 2003.  2004 1,152
2005 1,152
2006 1,152
2007 1,152
2008 1,152
Thereafter 1,752 7,512  The Company also has rental agreements
for all of the regional offices and warehouse space. Monthly rentals range from approximately $2,000 to $11,670. All of the regional office and warehouse leases can be terminated by either party within two or three months prior notice. The
retail shop lease has no stated expiration date, but can be terminated by either party with three months prior notice.  The rental expense incurred under operating leases during 2003, 2002 and 2001 was as follows:  2003
2002
2001
Rent expense 3,700 3,211 2,583  During 2002, the Company continued its
policy of renewing its transportation fleet by way of capital leases. The future minimum lease payments for the assets under capital lease at December 31, 2003 are as follows:  2004 1,391

contingent shares for acquisitions and employee stock options granted have been included in the above calculations of diluted earnings per share since the exercise price is less than the average market price of the common stock during portions of
2003. The warrants granted to the underwriters in connection with the Companys initial public offering were all exercised during 2002.  In May 2003, the Company executed a 3 for 2 stock split. The comparatives for 2002 and 2001 shown above have been adjusted to reflect this change.  11. Financial Instruments, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities  Financial Instruments and Their Fair Values  Financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, certain other
current assets, trade accounts payable, overdraft facilities and other payables. These financial instruments are disclosed separately in the consolidated balance sheets and their carrying values approximate their fair market values. Financial
instruments are denominated in stable currencies and they are of a short-term nature whose interest rates approximate current market rates. 
53 Table of Contents CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Monetary amounts in columns expressed in thousands except per share information 
Concentrations of Credit Risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable from
Polish companies. Credit is given to customers only after a thorough review of their credit worthiness. The Company does not normally require collateral with respect to credit sales. The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its
customers. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had no significant concentrations of credit risk. The Company has not experienced large credit losses in the past. The Company restricts temporary cash investments to financial institutions
with high credit ratings.  Inflation and Currency Risk  The Polish government has adopted policies that in recent years have lowered and made more
predictable the countrys level of inflation. The annual rate of inflation was approximately 36% in 2001, 11% in 2002 and 17% in 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2003 the Polish zloty has strengthened against the U.S. Dollar by over
3% finishing the year at 37405 compared with 38388 at the end of 2002.  Supply contracts  The Company has various agreements covering
its sources of supply, which, in some cases, may be terminated by either party on relatively short notice. Thus, there is a risk that a portion of the Companys supply of products could be curtailed at any time.  In 2003, over 5% of the Companys net sales resulted from sales of products purchased
from the following companies: Polmos Bialystok 17%, Sobieski Distribution 14%, Unicom Bols Group 13%, and Polmos Zielona Gora 6%.  Contingent liabilities  The Company is involved in litigation from time to time and has claims against it in connection with matters arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of these proceedings
will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys operations.  During 2003, the Company received a decision regarding a tax dispute in one of its subsidiaries which resulted in additional tax payable of $146,000. The Subsidiary is still disputing the basis of the decision though should it fail to
successfully argue its case there is a risk of a subsequent adjustment totaling $181,000.  12. Related Party Transactions  The
Company rents retail space under a short-term rental agreement from the Companys President. The rent is $2,200 per month. The total rental expense incurred during 2003 was $13,200, and for 2002 it was $26,400. The property was sold by the
Companys President in June 2003.  The Company uses training services
provided by a company part owned by the Companys chief financial officer. The value of services bought during 2002 was $8,000, and no services were provided in 2003. The Company also rented office space to this training company and received
rent payments totaling $11,520 during 2002 and zero for 2003.  Two of the
groups subsidiaries, Carey Agri and PWW, act as importers for the groups range of exclusive fine wines, spirits and beers. These products are then sold to other subsidiaries for eventual distribution throughout our national network. These
inter-company sales are eliminated as part of the consolidation process but for the year ended December 31, 2003, they amounted to approximately $129 million. As at December 31, 2003, the inter-company balances relating to these sales amounted to
approximately $6 million, however this too was also eliminated as part of the consolidation process. 
54 Table of Contents CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Monetary amounts in columns expressed in thousands except per share information 
13. Stock Option Plans and Warrants  The Company has elected to follow APB 25 and related Interpretations for its employee stock options because the alternative fair value
accounting provided for under FASB Statement 123 requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options. Under APB 25, no compensation expense is recognized when the exercise price of the
Companys employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.  The Companys 1997 Stock Incentive Plan Incentive Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to directors, executives, and
other employees employees of the Company and to non-employee service providers of the Company. Following a shareholder resolution on April 2003 and the stock split of May 2003, the Incentive Plan authorizes, and the Company has reserve
for future issuance, up to 2,625,000 shares of Common Stock subject to anti-dilution adjustment in the event of a stock-split, re-capitalization, or similar transaction. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company
administers the Incentive Plan.  The Company also operates an Executive Bonus
Plan under which officers of the Company are awarded stock options after achievement of agreed earnings targets. The number of stock options granted is based on the operating results achieved in the year prior to the date of the grant. The stock
option price is based on the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant.  The option exercise price for stock options granted under the Incentive Plan may not be less than fair market value but in some cases may be in excess of the Common Stock on the date of grant. The Company uses the
stock option price based on the closing price of the Common Stock on the day before the date of grant if such price is not materially different than the opening price of the Common Stock on the day of the grant. Accordingly, there is no compensation
expense recorded for options granted under the Incentive Plan to employees. Stock options may be exercised up to 10 years after the date of grant except as otherwise provided in the particular stock option agreement. Payment for the shares must be
by cash, which must be received by the Company prior to any shares being issued. Stock options granted vest immediately for grants to Board members, when they are elected to the Board. Stock options granted as part of an employee employment contract
vest after 12 months. Stock options granted as part of a loyalty program vest after three years.  Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by Statement 123, and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of
Statement 123. The fair value of these stock options were estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for 2001, 2002, and 2003, respectively: risk-free interest rate of
55%, 19%, and 19% dividend yields of 00%; volatility factors of the expected market price of the Companys common stock of 068, 105, and 125; and a weighted-average expected life of the option of 34 years. The above amounts represent
subjective estimates which are based on historical data and are deemed to be appropriate by the company.

years. Exercise prices for options outstanding as of December 31, 2003 ranged from $267 to $2965. The weighted average remaining contractual life of those options is 5 years. 
56 Table of Contents
CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Monetary amounts in columns expressed in thousands except per share information  For stock options granted to non-employee service providers, the Company accounted for these
grants in accordance with the fair value method in Statement 123. The fair value of these stock options were estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for 2001, 2002,
and 2003, respectively: risk-free interest rate of 55%, 19%, and 19%; dividend yields of 00%; volatility factors of the expected market price of the Companys common stock of 068, 105. and 125; and a weighted-average expected life of the
option of 34 years. During 2001, a total of $74,000 was treated as a deferred cost in anticipation of the Companys planned Placement in Private Equity which occurred in 2002. During 2002, a total of $306,000 was treated as a cost of raising
capital in its Placement in Private Equity and therefore charged to additional paid-in-capital. No options were granted to outside consultants during 2003.  During April of 2002, 30,000 stock options adjusted for May 2003 stock split were granted to certain officers of the Company. Under these grants, the option holder was
to receive a fixed number of stock options with an option price fixed at the date of grant only if certain earnings before income tax targets were achieved. Such grants are considered as variable under APB 25. In November of 2002, the Company
rescinded these variable stock option grants replacing them with a cash bonus plan based on certain earnings before income tax targets being achieved in 2002. Additional stock options were not awarded to the impacted officers.  14. Shareholders Equity  Treasury Stock  On November 27, 2000, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to buy up to 300,000 shares in the open market. The Company repurchased
96,150 shares in 2000 and 13,200 shares in the 2001 in open market for an aggregate cost of $150,000 through December 31, 2001. These shares have been treated as treasury stock. All share quantities have been adjusted for the stock split which
occurred in May 2003.  Dividend Policy  The Company has instituted a policy of having all of its subsidiaries except Carey Agri
pay dividends to their respective shareholders, either the Company or Carey Agri. The subsidiaries, except for Carey Agri, will distribute 50% of their respective current years after tax profits except for those generated during the first year of
ownership. The retained earnings prior to January 1, 2001 are not considered distributable. As at December 31, 2003, the Companys subsidiaries, will provide for dividends of approximately $5,395,500 to Carey Agri and the Company. Based upon on
the Companys shareholdings CEDC will receive $925,900 and Carey Agri $4,469,600.  Redeemable Stock  Certain common stock issued in connection
with the acquisition of Damianex was subject to a put option, which allows the seller to require the Company to repurchase the shares at $1200 per share during the period between April 25, 2003 and April 29, 2003. The common stock attributable to
this option has been classified as redeemable common stock at an amount of $1200 per share $1,781,000. The Put option expired unexercised on April 29, 2003 and the liability was transferred to shareholder equity.  Restricted Stock  The Company issues common stock as part of the consideration given in connection with its acquisitions. These securities are issued in
private placements and are not publicly tradable. In addition, the recipients of these securities generally agree to contractual lock-up periods ranging from six months to three years, and the certificates representing these securities bear
restrictive legends setting forth the restrictions on transfer. If the holder of these securities satisfies the holding period under Rule 144 of the Securities Act 1933 and 
57 Table of Contents
CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Monetary amounts in columns expressed in thousands except per share information  the lock-up period has expired, counsel for the Company will render an opinion to the
transfer agent advising that the certificate representing the restricted securities can be reissued without restrictive legend.  15. Derivative financial instruments  Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 133, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments. All derivatives, whether
designated as hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The Company uses derivatives to moderate the financial market risks of its business operations. Derivative products such as forward contracts
are used to hedge the foreign currency market exposures underlying certain liabilities with financial institutions. The Companys accounting policies for these instruments are based on its designation of these instruments as hedging
transactions. An instrument is designated as a hedge based in part on its effectiveness in risk reduction and one-to-one matching of derivatives with the related balance sheet risk.  The Company has designated forward contracts as fair value hedges i.e., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of the foreign
denominated bank loans, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period.  The adoption of SFAS 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in no cumulative adjustment to the
financial statements.  For currency forward contracts, effectiveness is
measured by using the forward-to-forward rate compared to the underlying economic exposure. The Companys hedging policy was considered highly effective for the period in which the Company undertook hedging activities.  During the fourth quarter, the Company converted approximately 98% of its U.S. Dollar and
EURO denominated debt into Polish zloty denominated debt and as a result the use of currency forward contracts was no longer necessary. As a result as at December 31, 2002 and 2003, there were no open forward contracts.  2003
