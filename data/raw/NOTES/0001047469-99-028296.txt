ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF
U.S. OFFICE PRODUCTS COMPANY   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 14a1 on page 96 present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of U.S. Office Products Company and its
subsidiaries at April 24, 1999 and April 25, 1998, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period
ended April 24, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed
in the index appearing under Item 14a2 on page 96 presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction
with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements
and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted
our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

NOTE 1--BUSINESS ORGANIZATION
U.S. Office Products Company U.S. Office Products or the Company was
founded in October 1994. The Company is a supplier of a broad range of office
products and business services to corporate customers. The Company serves a
broad range of business customers, from large corporations to small businesses.
The Company provides office products and business services in North America, New
Zealand and Australia and, through a 49% owned subsidiary, in the United
Kingdom.
NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes to
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of U.S. Office Products
and the companies acquired in business combinations accounted for under the
purchase method the Purchased Companies from their respective acquisition
dates and give retroactive effect to the results of the companies acquired in
business combinations accounted for under the pooling-of-interests method the
Pooled Companies for all periods presented. As a result of the Company
spin-off of its Technology Solutions, Print Management, Educational Supplies,
and Corporate Travel Services businesses collectively, the Spin-Off
Companies, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the
results of the Spin-Off Companies as discontinued operations through June 9,
1998 the effective date of the Spin-Off. See Note 3, Strategic Restructuring
Plan. The Company continuing operations consist of its North American Office
Products Group which includes office supplies, office furniture, and breakroom
products and services office coffee, beverage and vending services NAOPG,
Mail Boxes Etc. MBE, which the Company acquired in November 1997, the
Company international operations in New Zealand and Australia referred to
herein as the Blue Star Group, and the Company 49% interest in Dudley
Stationery Limited Dudley, a U.K. contract stationer. NAOPG operates
primarily in the United States; it also includes two coffee and beverage
businesses located in Canada.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
During the consolidation of several warehouse and distribution facilities in
late fiscal 1999, the Company identified inventory losses greater than reserves
previously established to cover slow moving and obsolete inventory. As a result,
the Company developed new methodologies to calculate the estimated reserve for
slow moving and obsolete inventory in NAOPG, which resulted in the recognition
of additional inventory reserves of $7,031 in the fourth quarter. In addition,
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company recorded an additional
$1,212 increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts for NAOPG.
DEFINITION OF FISCAL YEAR
As used in these consolidated financial statements and related notes to
consolidated financial statements, fiscal 1999, fiscal 1998 and fiscal
1997 refer to the Company fiscal years ended April 24, 1999, April 25, 1998
and April 26, 1997, respectively. On August 20, 1996, the Company Board
58
U.S. OFFICE PRODUCTS COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
of Directors approved a change in the Company fiscal year-end, effective for
fiscal 1997, from April 30 to the last Saturday in April.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its majority owned subsidiaries. Investments in less than 50% owned entities
are accounted for under the equity method. All significant intercompany
transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made to fiscal 1998 and fiscal 1997 to
conform to the current year presentation.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers temporary cash investments with original maturities of
three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable. Receivables
arising from sales to customers are not collateralized and, as a result,
management continually monitors the financial condition of its customers to
reduce the risk of loss.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined
on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis and consist primarily of products held for
sale.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is stated at cost. Additions and improvements that
extend the physical or economic life of property and equipment are capitalized.
Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation of property and
equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the respective assets. The estimated useful lives range from 25 to 40
years for buildings and its components and 3 to 15 years for furniture, fixtures
and equipment. Property and equipment leased under capital leases are being
amortized over the lesser of its useful life or its lease term. Gains and losses
from sales and retirements are included in operations as they occur.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill, which represents the excess
of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations
accounted for under the purchase method. Goodwill is amortized on a
straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from 20 to 40 years.
Management periodically evaluates the recoverability of goodwill, which would be
adjusted for a permanent decline in
59

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
value, if any, as determined by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash
flows from operations to net book value.
ACCRUED ACQUISITION COSTS
The Company accrues the direct external costs incurred in conjunction with
the consummation of business combinations and the costs incurred to consolidate
acquired operations into existing Company facilities, including the external
costs and liabilities to close redundant facilities and severance and relocation
costs related to the acquired entity employees in accordance with EITF Issue
No. 95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business
Combination.
TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Balance sheet accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated using the
year-end exchange rate, and statement of operations accounts are translated
using the monthly average exchange rates. Translation adjustments are recorded
as a separate component of other comprehensive loss. In fiscal 1999, 1998 and
1997, currency translation adjustments were not adjusted for income taxes as the
Company considered its investment in foreign subsidiaries to be permanent in
nature. During fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997, U.S. Office Products Company the
Parent considered its intercompany loans to the Blue Star Group to be a
long-term investment and, therefore, the currency transaction gain loss
related to the intercompany loans is recorded as a component of other
comprehensive loss. As a result of the strategic review of operations conducted
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, the Parent has subsequently changed
its perspective on the Blue Star Group operations and no longer considers the
intercompany loans to be long-term in nature. Accordingly, effective April 25,
1999, the Company will record the currency transaction gain loss related to
its intercompany loans with the Blue Star Group as a component of income from
continuing operations.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact
of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt. The swap agreements are
contracts to exchange floating rate for fixed interest payments periodically
over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional
amounts. The notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements are used to
measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of
exposure to credit loss. For interest rate instruments that effectively hedge
interest rate exposures, the net cash amounts paid or received on the agreements
are accrued and recognized as a component of interest expense.
The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce
the impact of changes in the exchange rates of the New Zealand and Australian
dollars. As of April 24, 1999, the Company held contracts denominated in U.S.
dollars for a total notional amount of approximately $14,000 at rates ranging
from $051 to $056. These contracts mature on dates ranging from April 30, 1999
to December 31, 1999.

NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The estimated fair value of the Company financial instruments has been
determined using the following methods and assumptions   - The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
accounts payable approximate fair value   - The fair values of the 5 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2001 the
2001 Notes, the 5 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2003 the
2003 Notes and the 9 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 the 2008
Notes are based on quoted market prices   - The carrying amounts of the Company debt, other than the 2001 Notes, the
2003 Notes and the 2008 Notes, approximate fair value, based on discounted
cash flow analyses using the Company current incremental borrowing rates
for similar types of borrowing arrangements.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes have been computed utilizing the asset and liability approach
which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax
rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. Certain
companies acquired in pooling-of-interests transactions during fiscal 1997
elected to be taxed as subchapter S corporations, and accordingly, no federal
income taxes were recorded by those companies for periods prior to their
acquisition by U.S. Office Products.
TAXES ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS
No provision was made for U.S. income taxes on earnings of subsidiary
companies which the Company controls but does not include in the consolidated
federal income tax return, since it was management practice and intent to
permanently reinvest the earnings of these subsidiaries.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognized upon the delivery of products or upon the completion
of services provided to customers as no additional obligations to the customers
exist. The Company also leases equipment to customers under both short-term and
long-term lease agreements. Revenue related to short-term leases is recognized
on a monthly basis over the life of the lease. Certain long-term leases qualify
as sales-type leases and, accordingly, the present value of the future lease
payments is recognized as income upon delivery of the equipment to the customer.
The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary MBE, enters into area and
individual franchise agreements in the United States and master license
agreements in other countries. Area franchise agreements grant the area
franchisee the exclusive right to market individual franchise centers for the
Company in the area franchisee territory. The area franchisee generally
receives a commission on the individual franchises sold as well as a share of
the royalties earned by the Company from centers in the area franchisee
territory. Individual franchise agreements grant the individual franchisee the
exclusive right to open and operate a franchise center in the individual
franchisee territory.
61
U.S. OFFICE PRODUCTS COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Franchise fee revenue is recognized upon the completion of all significant
initial services provided to the franchisee, area franchisee or master licensee
and upon satisfaction of all material conditions of the franchise agreement,
area franchise agreement or master license. For individual franchise sales, the
significant initial obligations that must be completed before any revenue is
recognized are: the site is located, a store lease is in place, the franchise
agreement has been signed, the store design and layout is complete, all manuals
and systems have been provided, and training at MBE is complete. For area
franchise sales, the significant initial obligations that must be completed
before any revenue is recognized are: all operating manuals are provided,
training is completed and a pilot center is opened. For master license
agreements, the significant obligations that must be completed before any
revenue is recognized are: all operating manuals are provided and training is
completed. Revenue is recognized using the installment method when the revenue
is collectible over an extended period and no reasonable basis exists for
estimating collectibility.
On a monthly basis, all individual franchisees are required to pay royalty
and marketing fees to the Company based upon a percentage of each franchisee
sales as defined. Such fees are recognized as revenue based upon reported or
estimated sales activity by the franchisees. Revenue from sales of supplies and
equipment is recognized when orders are shipped, or the lease is completed,
whichever is later.
COST OF REVENUES
Delivery and occupancy costs are included in cost of revenues. Vendor
rebates are recorded as a reduction in the cost of inventory and recognized as a
reduction in cost of revenues when such inventory is sold.
STRATEGIC RESTRUCTURING PLAN COSTS
Strategic Restructuring Costs represent costs incurred in conjunction with
the completion of the Company Strategic Restructuring Plan. See Note 3,
Strategic Restructuring Plan for a description of the components of this plan.
OPERATING RESTRUCTURING COSTS
The Company records the costs of consolidating existing Company facilities,
including the external costs and liabilities to close redundant Company
facilities, and severance costs related to the Company employees in accordance
with EITF Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain
Costs Incurred in Restructuring.
NON-RECURRING ACQUISITION COSTS
Non-recurring acquisition costs represent acquisition costs incurred by the
Company in business combinations accounted for under the pooling-of-interests
method. These costs include accounting, legal and investment banking fees, real
estate and environmental assessments and appraisals, various regulatory fees and
recognition of transaction related obligations. Generally accepted accounting
principles require the Company to expense all acquisition costs both those paid
by the Company and those paid by the sellers of the acquired companies related
to business combinations accounted for under the pooling-of-interests method.

NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
ADVERTISING COSTS
The Company expenses advertising costs when the advertisement occurs.
Advertising costs are included in the consolidated statement of operations as a
component of selling, general and administrative expenses. During fiscal 1999,
1998 and 1997, the Company incurred advertising expenses of $20,276, $18,473 and
$14,355, respectively.
NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE
Net income loss per share is calculated in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share. SFAS No.
128 requires the dual presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face of the
consolidated statement of operations. Basic EPS excludes dilution and is
computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects
the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to
issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In fiscal 1999, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and display of
comprehensive income loss and its components. Comprehensive income loss
consists of net income loss and foreign currency translation adjustments as
presented in the consolidated statement of stockholders' equity. The adoption of
SFAS No. 130 had no impact on total stockholders' equity or net income loss.
In fiscal 1999, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, which supersedes SFAS No.
14. SFAS No. 131 requires the Company to report segment information based on the
management, or operating segment, approach rather than the industry
approach required under SFAS No. 14. Additionally, SFAS No. 131 requires
disclosures about the Company products and services, geographic areas and
major customers. The adoption of SFAS No. 131 had no impact on the results of
operations or financial position of the Company, but did affect the disclosure
of segment information.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS
No. 133 is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2000 fiscal 2002 for the Company. SFAS No. 133 requires that all
derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current
earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is
designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge
transaction. Management of the Company anticipates that, due to its limited use
of derivative instruments, the adoption of SFAS No. 133 will not have a
significant effect on the results of operations or financial position of the
Company.
In March 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee issued Statement
of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. SOP 98-1 is effective for financial
statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998 fiscal 2000 for
the Company. SOP 98-1 provides guidance for accounting for the costs of
computer software developed
63

NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
or obtained for internal use. Management of the Company anticipates that the
adoption of SOP 98-1 will not have a significant effect on the results of
operations or financial position of the Company.
NOTE 3--STRATEGIC RESTRUCTURING PLAN
In June 1998, the Company completed a comprehensive restructuring plan the
Strategic Restructuring Plan that was approved by the Company Board of
Directors in January 1998. The principal elements of the Strategic Restructuring
Plan were   - EQUITY TENDER OFFER. Pursuant to a self-tender offer the Equity
Tender, the Company repurchased 9,259,261 shares of its common stock,
including 1,140,186 shares that were issued on exercise of vested and
unvested options for common stock at $10800 per share or in the case of
stock options, at $10800 per share minus the exercise price of the
options. The Company repurchased the shares for $934,569 in cash. In
fiscal 1999, the Company recorded a non-cash compensation expense of
$57,711, related to the participation of stock options in the Equity
Tender.
- SPIN-OFF DISTRIBUTIONS. After acceptance of the shares in the Equity
Tender, the Company distributed to U.S. Office Products' stockholders the
shares of four separate companies: Aztec Technology Partners, Inc. one
share for every 125 shares of U.S. Office Products common stock held,
Workflow Management, Inc. one share for every 1875 shares of U.S. Office
Products common stock held, School Specialty, Inc. one share for every
225 shares of U.S. Office Products common stock held and Navigant
International, Inc. one share for every 25 shares of U.S. Office
Products common stock held collectively, the Spin-Off Companies. The
distributions of the shares of the Spin-Off Companies are referred to in
these consolidated financial statements as the Distributions. The
Spin-Off Companies hold U.S. Office Products' former Technology Solutions,
Print Management, Educational Supplies and Corporate Travel Services
businesses, respectively.
- EQUITY INVESTMENT. After the Distributions, an affiliate Investor of
an investment fund managed by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Inc., a private
investment firm, acquired the following equity securities of the Company
for $254,176, net of $15,824 in fees: i 9,101,129 shares 249% of the
Company common stock, ii special warrants the Special Warrants
entitling Investor to purchase additional common stock in certain
circumstances intended to permit Investor to maintain its 249% equity
ownership position, and iii warrants the Warrants entitling Investor
to purchase additional shares of common stock for $405,000 equal to the
number of shares of common stock it purchased outright plus the number of
shares it acquires or is entitled to acquire pursuant to the Special
Warrants. In April 1999, in conjunction with Investor additional
investment in the Company see Note 14, Stockholders' Equity, the
exercise price of the Warrants was reduced to $5625 per share.
In conjunction with the Strategic Restructuring Plan, U.S. Office Products
completed the following financing transactions the Financing Transactions in
June 1998   - Pursuant to a tender offer, the Company repurchased $222,215 of its 2003
Notes for a purchase price of 945% of the principal amount and accrued
interest on such notes.
- Pursuant to an exchange offer, the Company exchanged $130,989 of its 2001
Notes for 2,025,185 shares of common stock at an exchange rate of 15461
shares of U.S. Office Products common stock

for each $1 principal amount of such notes, which effectively reduced the
conversion price of such notes from $7600 to $6468 while the exchange
offer was open.
- The Company entered into a new $1,225,000 senior secured bank credit
facility the New Credit Facility that consisted of the following i a

revolving credit facility; iii a $100,000 seven-year term loan facility;
and iv a $675,000 eight-year term loan facility. As a result of the
Company entering into the New Credit Facility, the former credit facility
was terminated. In agreement with the Company lenders, certain terms of
the New Credit Facility were subsequently modified. see Note 9, Credit
Facilities.
- The Company issued and sold $400,000 of the 2008 Notes in a private
placement at 99583% of the principal amount.

NOTE 5--ACCRUED ACQUISITION COSTS
As of the consummation date of an acquisition, the Company begins to assess
and formulate a plan to exit activities of the acquired companies. Typically,
this involves evaluating the facilities of the Company and the acquired
companies in the specific geographic areas, determining which of the acquired
facilities will be exited and identifying employee groups that will be
terminated or relocated. In most cases, the facilities are closed and the
employees terminated within one year of the completion of the plan.

projections less than the carrying value of the unamortized goodwill related to
such companies, thus indicating impairment. As a result, in fiscal 1999 an

In connection with the completion of the Strategic Restructuring Plan and
the Financing Transactions, the Company borrowed the full amount of the two
single-draw term loan facilities. The multi-draw term loan facility and the
revolving credit facility remain available for future borrowings. Costs incurred
in connection with the issuance of the two single-draw term loan facilities
totaling $10,407 are included in other assets and are being amortized over the
period to maturity. Interest rates on such borrowings bear interest, at the
Company option, at the lending bank base rate plus an applicable margin of
up to 150%, or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of up to 250%. A
commitment fee of 050% is applied to the multi-draw term loan facility and
seven-year term loan. The Company obligations under the New Credit Facility
are guaranteed by its present domestic subsidiaries; future material domestic
subsidiaries will also be required to guarantee these obligations. The New
Credit Facility is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its domestic subsidiaries; future material domestic subsidiaries
also will be required to pledge their assets as collateral. The Company was
required to enter into arrangements to ensure that the effective interest rate
paid by the Company on at least 50% of the aggregate amount outstanding under
the New Credit Facility and the 2008 Notes was at a fixed rate of interest. As a
result, the Company has entered into interest rate swap arrangements to limit
the LIBOR-based interest rate exposure on $500,000 of the outstanding balance
under the New Credit Facility to rates ranging from 57% to 60%. The interest
rate swap agreements expire over a period ranging from 2001 to 2003. As a result
of these swap agreements and including the fixed-rate 2008 Notes, the Company
has fixed the interest rates on $900,000 756% of the long-term debt
outstanding at April 24, 1999. The Company weighted average interest rate in
fiscal year 1999 was 82%.
The New Credit Facility includes, among others, restrictions on the
Company ability to incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, pay dividends,
or engage in certain other transactions, and requirements that the Company
maintain certain financial ratios, and other provisions customary for loans to
highly leveraged companies, including representations by the Company, conditions
to funding, cost and yield protections, restricted payment provisions, amendment
provisions and indemnification provisions. The New Credit Facility is subject to
mandatory prepayment in a variety of circumstances, including upon certain asset
sales and financing transactions, and also from excess cash flow as defined in
the Credit Facility.
The 2008 Notes are redeemable at any time on or after June 15, 2003,
initially at 104875% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest, if any,
declining ratably to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest, to
the redemption date, on or after June 15, 2006. In addition, at any time prior
to June 15, 2001, the Company at its option may redeem up to 35% of the original
principal amount of the 2008 Notes with the proceeds of one or more equity
offerings at a redemption price of 10975% of the principal amount of the 2008
Notes. The 2008 Notes are unsecured but are guaranteed by the Company present
domestic subsidiaries; future material domestic subsidiaries will be required to
guarantee the 2008 Notes. The indenture governing the 2008 Notes places
restrictions on the Company ability to incur indebtedness, to make certain
payments, investments, loans and guarantees and to sell or otherwise dispose of
a substantial portion of its assets to, or merge or consolidate with, another
entity. Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the 2008 Notes
totaling $10,348 are included in other assets and are being amortized over the
ten year period of maturity. The fair value of the 2008 Notes at April 24, 1999,
based upon quoted market prices, totaled $268,000.

included in other assets and are being amortized over the seven year period of
maturity. The fair value of the 2003 Notes at April 24, 1999, based upon quoted
market prices, totaled $1,615. In conjunction with the Strategic Restructuring
Plan, $222,215 of the 2003 Notes were retired at 945% of the principal amount,
resulting in an extraordinary gain in fiscal 1999 of $12,396, before provision
for income taxes, and the conversion price on the remaining outstanding 2003
Notes was adjusted to $6436. In addition, the Company recorded an extraordinary
expense of $5,174, before benefit from income taxes, related to the write-off of
debt issue costs capitalized in connection with the issuance of the 2003 Notes.
The 2001 Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company option
at specified redemption prices on or after February 3, 1998, but may not be

Notes are included in other assets and are being amortized over the five year
period of maturity. The fair value of the 2001 Notes at April 24, 1999, based
upon quoted market prices, totaled $4,466. In conjunction with the Strategic
Restructuring Plan, $130,989 of the 2001 Notes were exchanged for 2,025,185
shares of common stock at a conversion price that was temporarily reduced from
$7600 per share to $6468 per share, resulting in an expense in fiscal 1999 of
$20,436 as a result of the reduction in the conversion price, and the conversion
price on the remaining outstanding 2001 Notes was adjusted to $3870. In
addition, in fiscal 1999 the Company recorded an extraordinary expense of
$2,911, before benefit from income taxes, related to the write-off of debt issue

The Company foreign net operating losses NOLs arise from the Blue Star
Group operations in New Zealand and Australia. These foreign tax jurisdictions
do not limit the NOL carryforward period. The Company expects to be able to
utilize fully the NOLs by fiscal 2000 for the Australian operations and by
fiscal 2014 for the New Zealand operations.
Management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company
deferred tax assets are realizable. Accordingly, no valuation allowance has been
provided.
The Internal Revenue Service IRS tax assessment at April 25, 1998
relates to the deferral of a gain on the sale of land and a building by a
subsidiary of the Company. The IRS had determined that a portion of the gain
recorded by the subsidiary did not qualify for deferral and assessed the Company
additional taxes. The subsidiary recorded a deferred tax liability, including
interest, as a result of the assessment. In fiscal 1999, the matter was resolved
with the IRS, resulting in no additional taxes paid by the Company.

federal tax on their income was the responsibility of their individual
stockholders. Accordingly, the specific Pooled Companies provided no federal
income tax expense prior to these acquisitions by the Company.

NOTE 12--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
LITIGATION
During fiscal 1999, individuals purporting to represent various classes of
the Company stockholders filed actions in U.S. District Courts for the
Southern District of New York and for the District of Columbia. The actions
claim the named defendants, including the Company, made misstatements and failed
to disclose material information in connection with the Company Strategic
Restructuring Plan. Two of the actions allege breach of contract under
California law in conjunction with the Company acquisition of MBE. The actions
seek declaratory relief, damages and attorney fees. The Company is currently
awaiting filing of a consolidated amended complaint. The Company intends to
vigorously contest this action.
Complaints were also filed in fiscal 1999 by sellers of businesses that the
Company acquired in the fall of 1997 and that were spun off in connection with
the Strategic Restructuring Plan. The complaints assert violation of Federal
and/or state securities and other laws, claims of fraud, misrepresentation,
conspiracy, breach of contract, negligence and/or breach of fiduciary duty. The
Company believes that these claims may be subject to indemnification, in part,
under the terms of the distribution agreement executed in connection with the
Strategic Restructuring Plan. The Company intends to vigorously contest these
actions.
During fiscal 1998, a stockholder purporting to represent a class composed
of all U.S. Office Products' stockholders filed an action in the Delaware
Chancery Court. The action claims that the Directors breached their fiduciary
duty to the stockholders of U.S. Office Products by changing the terms of the
Equity Tender to include employee stock options. The complaint seeks injunctive
relief, damages and attorneys fees. The Company believes that this lawsuit is
without merit and intends to vigorously contest it.
The Company is, from time to time, a party to litigation arising in the
normal course of its business. Management believes that none of this litigation
will have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
operations or cash flows of the Company.
POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
The Company has entered into employment agreements with several employees
that would result in payments to these employees upon a change of control or
certain other events. No amounts have been accrued at April 24, 1999 or April
25, 1998 related to these agreements.
NOTE 13--EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Effective September 1, 1996, the Company implemented the U.S. Office
Products 401k Retirement Plan the 401k Plan which allows employee
contributions in accordance with Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code.
The Company matches a portion of employee contributions and all full-time
employees are eligible to participate in the 401k Plan after six months of
service. In fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997 the Company matching contribution
expense was $2,329, $2,906 and $1,195, respectively.

using the same weighted average number of shares outstanding since, as a result
of the loss from continuing operations during the period, all of the Company
employee stock options and the two series of convertible debt securities
outstanding during the period were anti-dilutive. The Company had additional
employee stock options and two series of convertible debt securities outstanding
during fiscal 1998 and 1997 that were not included in the computation of diluted
EPS because they were anti-dilutive.

PREFERRED STOCK
In April 1999, the Company issued 73,262 shares of non-voting convertible
preferred stock to a fund led by Investor for $49,332, net of fees of $1,668.
The preferred shares are convertible to 7,326,200 shares of common stock, upon
transfer to anyone other than Investor or its affiliates, and require no
additional investment upon conversion. The preferred shares do not have dividend
rights in addition to the level of dividends provided to common stockholders and
have a nominal liquidation preference. The preferred stock carries no voting
rights, but where stockholder approval is required for a merger, consolidation,
or sale of all or substantially all of the Company assets, the preferred stock
will vote together with the common stock.
COMMON STOCK
In June 1998, the Company repurchased 9,259,261 shares of common stock in
the Equity Tender Offer described in Note 3.
In June 1998, the Company effected a one-for-four reverse split of the
Company common stock whereby each four shares of common stock were exchanged
for one share of common stock. In October 1997, the Company effected a
three-for-two split of the Company common stock. All share and per share data
appearing in these consolidated financial statements and notes hereto have been
retroactively adjusted for these splits.
STOCK WARRANTS
In June 1998, the Company issued the Special Warrants entitling Investor to
purchase additional shares of common stock in certain circumstances intended to
permit Investor to maintain its 249% equity ownership position. In addition,
the Company issued the Warrants entitling Investor to purchase additional shares
of common stock for $405,000 equal to the number of shares of common stock it
purchased as part of its initial equity investment plus the number of shares it
acquires or is entitled to acquire pursuant to the Special Warrants. The
Warrants are exercisable at any time after June 10, 2000 until June 10, 2010. In
April 1999, in conjunction with investor additional investment in the Company,
the exercise price of the Warrants was reduced to $5625 per share.
STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS
In October 1994, the Board of Directors and the Company stockholders
approved the Company 1994 Long-Term Compensation Plan the Plan. The
purpose of the Plan is to provide officers, key employees and consultants with
additional incentives by increasing their ownership interests in the Company.
The maximum number of options to purchase common stock granted in any calendar
or fiscal year under the Plan, as amended, is equal to 20% of the aggregate
number of shares of the Company common stock outstanding at the time an award
is granted, less, in each case, the number of shares subject to previously
outstanding awards under the Plan. At April 24, 1999, options to acquire
3,657,078 shares of common stock were outstanding under the Plan.
In August 1996, the Board of Directors and the Company stockholders
approved the Company 1996 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Plan the Directors'
Plan. The purpose of the Directors' Plan is to promote ownership by
non-employee directors of a greater proprietary interest in the Company, thereby
81

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

aligning such directors' interests more closely with the interests of
stockholders of the Company. A total of 750,000 shares of common stock have been
reserved for issuance under the Directors' Plan. At April 24, 1999, options to
acquire 68,165 shares of common stock were outstanding under the Directors'
Plan.
Upon consummation of the merger with MBE in November 1997, the Company
assumed each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of MBE common
stock and converted such options into options to purchase shares of the
Company common stock. The purpose of the MBE plans was to provide MBE
employees with additional incentives by increasing their ownership interests in
the Company. These plans granted either incentive stock options or non-qualified
stock options. No additional options have been granted under these plans since
the date of the merger. At April 24, 1999, options to acquire 79,162 shares of
the Company common stock were outstanding under the plans.
The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for its stock option
plans. Accordingly, because the exercise prices of the options granted have
equaled the market price on the date of grant, no compensation expense has been
recognized for stock options granted. Had compensation cost for the Company
stock options been recognized based upon the fair value of the stock options on
the grant date under the methodology prescribed by SFAS No. 123, the Company
income loss from continuing operations before extraordinary items and income
loss per share from continuing operations before extraordinary items would

In December 1998, the Company completed a program in which it offered its
employees holding stock options issued by the Company the opportunity to
surrender their existing options for a smaller number of options at a lower
exercise price per share. Each employee holding options issued by the Company
was given the opportunity to have the Company i cancel existing options and
ii issue to the employee a

NOTE 14--STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY CONTINUED
smaller number of new options with an exercise price equal to $5375, the
closing price of the Company common stock on December 11, 1998. The number of
options received was equal to the number of old options multiplied by a fraction
that varied with the exercise price of old options. The fraction ranged from
08844 for old options with an exercise price of $978 to 00984 for old options
with an exercise price of $5490. Prior to the program, options to acquire
7,546,722 shares were outstanding; after completion of the program, options to
acquire 2,618,413 shares were issued and outstanding.
In June 1998, 1,140,186 stock options were exercised as part of the Equity
Tender. In addition, as a result of the Distributions, 713,015 stock options
held by employees of the Spin-Off Companies were canceled as they were replaced
with stock options of the Spin-Off Companies and, consistent with the
anti-dilution provisions of the Plan and the Director Plan, the Company
increased the number of options outstanding and reduced the exercise prices of
such options in order to keep option holders in the same economic position
immediately before and after the Distributions. This was accomplished by
multiplying the number of options by 218 and dividing the exercise prices of
such options by 218.
NOTE 15--SEGMENT REPORTING
BUSINESS SEGMENTS

20,758    8,024    5,076     178    34,036    a EBITDA represents earnings from continuing operations before interest
expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense,
Strategic Restructuring Plan costs, operating restructuring costs, impaired
asset write-offs, non-recurring acquisition costs, loss on sale and closure of
businesses, other income expense and extraordinary items. EBITDA is not a
measurement of performance under generally accepted accounting principles and
should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of
performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is not necessarily
comparable with similarly titled measures for other companies.
b The amounts listed above as identifiable assets of continuing operations
at year-end differ from the total asset amounts presented on the consolidated
balance sheet since net assets of discontinued operations of $486,618 and
$171,122 at April 25, 1998 and April 26, 1997, respectively, were excluded from
the above analysis but are included in total assets on the Company
consolidated balance sheet.
Effective April 25, 1999, the Company will evaluate its operations by the
following product lines: North American office supplies and office coffee
services, North American office furniture, North American refreshment services,
the Blue Star Group, Mail Boxes Etc., and Other.

The following is summarized condensed consolidating financial information
for the Company, segregating guarantor subsidiaries and non-guarantor
subsidiaries. The accompanying financial information in the Guarantor
Subsidiaries column represents the financial information of the domestic
subsidiaries that guarantee the New Credit Facility and the 2008 Notes. The
guarantor subsidiaries are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company and the
guarantees are full, unconditional and joint and several. Separate financial
statements of the guarantor subsidiaries are not presented because management
believes that separate financial statements would not be material to investors.
