In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity and of
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Carnegie Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company at December 31, 1994,
1995 and 1996, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the
years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

CARNEGIE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1994, 1995 AND 1996
1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS
Carnegie Group, Inc. Carnegie Group or the Company provides
client/server software development services that integrate advanced
user-centered, intelligent software technologies with clients' existing
computing infrastructures to automate and enhance complex business
processes. The Company performs business and technical consulting, custom
software development, and systems integration services to improve clients'
productivity and market position in two business areas: customer
interaction; and logistics, planning, and scheduling. Within these areas,
the Company targets its services to clients in the financial services,
government, manufacturing and telecommunications industries.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include Carnegie Group, Inc., and its
wholly owned subsidiaries, Carnegie Group Investments, Inc., Carnegie
Investment Services, Inc., Carnegie Services, Inc., and Carnegie Federal
Systems Corporation. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Software services. Revenue from software services contracts is recognized
as time and material costs are incurred, or as project milestones or
deliverables are met, and is adjusted using the percentage-of-completion
method of accounting, as required. When a loss is anticipated for a
software services contract, a provision for such loss is recorded in the
period in which the loss becomes evident. The difference between
contractual amounts billed in advance to customers and amounts recorded as
revenue is included in advance billings. Amounts earned but not billed to
the customer are included in accounts receivable.
Software licenses. Revenue from software licenses is recognized when a
license agreement is executed, the client purchase order is received and
the software is shipped to the customer. No significant vendor and
post-contract support obligations remain at the time revenue is recognized.
Revenue applicable to insignificant post-contract support is deferred and
recognized ratably as the obligations are fulfilled. Revenue from customer
support and training is recognized over the period in which the services
are rendered.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Certain internal development costs, primarily coding and testing of new
products and enhancements to existing products, are capitalized after
technological feasibility has been established. Capitalized software costs
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of
each product, not to exceed five years, or the ratio of current revenue to
the total of current and anticipated future revenue, whichever is the
greater annual charge. Based on the Company product development process,
technological feasibility is not established until completion of a working
model. Costs incurred by the Company between completion of the working
model and the point at which the product is ready for general release have
been insignificant in recent years. Accordingly, no software development
costs were capitalized in 1994, 1995 or 1996.
25
26
CARNEGIE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
Research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses for the
development of licensable software for sale as stand-alone products.
Research and development costs, including software costs incurred prior to
establishing technological feasibility, are expensed as incurred.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash equivalents consist of short-term interest-bearing deposits with
original maturities of less than 90 days.
CREDIT RISKS
Financial instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risks consist primarily of billed and unbilled receivables. The Company
clients are primarily involved in the financial services, government,
manufacturing and telecommunications industries Notes 3 and 9.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to billed and unbilled accounts
receivable are limited due to the Company credit evaluation process.
Historically, the Company has not incurred any significant credit-related
losses.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Properties are recorded at cost. Equipment under capital lease is recorded
at the lower of fair market value or the present value of future minimum
lease payments. For financial reporting purposes, depreciation and
amortization are provided under the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the respective assets, which range up to 5 years but are
primarily 3 years or less. The Company uses accelerated methods for income
tax purposes.
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN
The Company has a Section 401k Savings Plan the Plan. The Plan allows
employees to contribute up to 20 percent of their annual compensation,
subject to statutory limitations. Company contributions to the Plan are
discretionary. No Company contributions have been made to the Plan through
December 31, 1996.
INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 SFAS 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach in accounting for
income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of temporary differences between carrying amounts and the tax
bases of all assets and liabilities.
PER SHARE AMOUNTS
All share and per share data have been adjusted to give effect to the 2:5
reverse stock split of the Company common stock which became effective
on September 18, 1995 Note 7. An initial public offering of common stock
was consummated on December 4, 1995. Pursuant to Securities and Exchange
Commission staff accounting guidance, all common share equivalents issued
subsequent to September 18, 1994 using the initial public offering price
of $800 per share for purposes of applying the treasury stock method
through September 30, 1995 the interim period included in the initial
public offering prospectus have been included in the calculation of common
shares outstanding as if they were outstanding for all periods for which
net income or loss per share is presented.
Earnings per share amounts are based on weighted average shares
outstanding. Stock options are dilutive in the years 1994, 1995 and 1996
and are included as share equivalents using the treasury stock method.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, encourages, but does not require companies
to record compensation cost for stock-based
26
27
Carnegie Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements--Continued
employee compensation plans at fair value. The Company has chosen to
continue to account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value
method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APBO 25 ,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations.
Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess,
if any, of the quoted market price of the Company stock at the date of
the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. Refer
to Note 8.

For the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996, amortization expense
was $41,358, $57,704, and $57,861 respectively.
5. COMMITMENTS
The Company leases office space in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, under an
agreement that provides for escalating rent. Rent expense is normalized
over the term of the lease which expires in December 1999. The difference
between cash payments and rent expense is carried as accrued rent.
Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases and
capital leases as of December 31, 1996, are as follows:
OPERATING   CAPITAL
$1,721,963   $34,346
1,603,158            1,345,853                                              Total minimum lease   $4,670,974   34,346
Amount representing imputed interest.          1,104
Present value of future minimum lease payments.         $33,242
Minimum payments under operating leases have not been reduced by minimum
sublease rentals of $292,242 due in the future under noncancelable
subleases. The interest rate on the capitalized lease is 975%. Rent
expense under operating leases was $1,239,602, $1,546,873, and $1,592,215,
and receipts under subleases were $194,810, $288,821 and $286,105 during
the periods ended December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively.
6. BORROWINGS
At December 31, 1994, the Company had a $2,500,000 line of credit
agreement. At December 31, 1995, the line of credit increased to
$3,000,000. Additionally, the Company had an agreement for a $500,000
discretionary line of credit. The availability of those funds were subject
to the lender approval. Both the $3,000,000 committed line and the
discretionary line expired on June 30, 1996.
Effective July 1, 1996, the agreement was amended by extending the
expiration date from June 30, 1996 to June 29, 1997 and increasing the
committed line to $3,500,000, while eliminating the $500,000 discretionary
amount. Borrowings under this agreement are collateralized by accounts
receivable. The line of credit bears interest at the bank prime interest
rate and the bank charges a 015% fee per annum on the unused portion of
the line of credit. The line of credit agreement in place at December 31,
1994 and 1995 bore interest at the bank prime interest rate plus 075   and the bank charged a 025% fee per annum on the unused portion. The
bank prime interest rate was 850%, 850% and 825% at December 31, 1994,
1995 and 1996 respectively. There were no borrowings outstanding at
December 31, 1994, 1995 or 1996.
7. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
In 1994, the Company accepted 190,000 shares of the Company common stock
from a former officer in order to satisfy a note receivable of $475,000.
The note, which was originally received for purchase of the stock by the
former officer, was due in 1994. Because the note receivable had been
recorded by the Company as a reduction of stockholders' equity and its
recorded balance approximated the fair value of the treasury shares
acquired, this acquisition of treasury stock had no impact on the Company
net assets.
On September 1, 1995, the Board of Directors authorized 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $01 per share. Terms of any series of such
preferred stock will be established by the Board of Directors at the time
of issue.

8. STOCK OPTIONS
1989 STOCK OPTION PLAN
Incentive stock options granted under the Carnegie Group, Inc., 1989 Stock
Option Plan expire 10 years from the date of grant, generally become
exercisable over a four-year period and are adjusted pro forma for stock
splits or dividends. All grants of incentive stock options under the plan
are exercisable at prices that were at least 100% of the fair market value
of the Company common stock at the date of grant as determined by the
Board of Directors. The plan provides that the payment for the shares may
be in cash or by exchange of common stock previously held.
In May 1992, the Company issued 4,000 nonqualified stock options under this
plan to a newly elected member of the Board of Directors at an exercise
price of $165 per share. The options become exercisable over a four-year
period and expire on May 11, 2002. In March 1995, the Company issued 2,000
nonqualified stock options under the plan to the same member of the Board
of Directors at an exercise price of $465 per share. The options become
exercisable over a four-year period and expire on March 6, 2005.
The following table summarizes activity under the plan:

stock option plan.
At December 31, 1996, options to purchase 613,125 shares of the Company
common stock were exercisable under this plan.
On February 7, 1995, the Board of Directors determined the estimated fair
market value of the stock to be $465 per share. During 1995, options to
acquire 43,060 shares were granted at this exercise price.
NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS: On September 30, 1985, in exchange for a
six-month personal guarantee of a line of credit to the Company from a
bank, an individual was granted an option to purchase 40,000 shares of
common stock exercisable over a 10-year period at a price of $5625 per
share. The option was exercised on September 29, 1995.
Not included in the table above are 108,000 nonqualified stock options
which do not qualify under Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code,
which were granted in August 1987, as part of the employment agreement with
an officer, at an exercise price of $0025 per share. These options became
exercisable immediately upon grant, and all of these options are currently
outstanding.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION PLAN
In 1991, the Company implemented the Carnegie Group, Inc. Long-Term
Incentive Stock Option Plan to provide an incentive for the Company key
management employees to achieve long-term corporate objectives.
The options under the Long-Term Incentive Plan become exercisable on
September 29, 2001, subject to an acceleration clause. Each year,
acceleration can be awarded based on predetermined Company performance
criteria and individual performance criteria set by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors. Within 90 days after the previous
year, the Committee determines the number of shares allotted shares to be
accelerated for exercise, if any. Options subject to acceleration will
become exercisable over a two-year period, with one-third becoming
exercisable immediately upon the determination date and the remaining
two-thirds becoming exercisable on each anniversary of the determination
date.
In October 1991, under this plan, 662,000 shares were granted to 16 key
management employees at an option price of $125, which was the
Board-determined fair market value at the date of grant.
The following table summarizes activity under the plan:
OPTIONS
AVAILABLE    GRANTED &    WEIGHTED AVERAGE

* See additional discussion below regarding the termination of the long
term incentive stock option plan.
Of the total options outstanding as of December 31, 1996, the number of
shares subject to accelerated exercise was 389,116 and 216,428 shares had
become exercisable.
1995 STOCK OPTION PLAN
In 1995, the Company implemented the 1995 Stock Option Plan 1995 Stock
Option Plan under which stock option awards may be made to eligible
employees of the Company. Awards to employees under the 1995 Stock Option
Plan may take the form of incentive stock options or nonqualified stock
options. The term of each option will be determined by the Board of
Directors, but no option will be exercisable more than 10 years after the
date of grant. The exercise price for incentive stock options must be at
least equal to 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the
date of grant. The exercise price of nonqualified options will be
determined by the Board of Directors at the time of grant. The maximum
number of shares of common stock which may be issued or delivered and as to
which awards may be granted under the 1995 Stock Option Plan is 800,000
shares. In 1995, the Board of Directors terminated the 1989 Stock Option
and Long-Term Incentive Plans and directed that options under the plans
which thereafter become available for grant because outstanding options
expire or terminate unexercised will become available for award under the
1995 Stock Option Plan.

SUMMARY STOCK OPTION INFORMATION
The Company applies APBO 25 and related interpretations in accounting for
its three stock-based compensation plans. No compensation cost has been
recognized for its stock option plans and its stock purchase plan. The pro
forma data below reflects the effect had compensation cost for the
Company three stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the
fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with
SFAS 123.
1995      1996
Net Income        As Reported.  $4,676,029   $3,360,156

Earnings per share    As Reported.  $   82   $   47
Pro forma.  $   80   $   34
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions used
for grants in 1995 and 1996: risk-free interest rates of 585 to 752
percent and 568-697 percent; dividend yields of zero in both years;
expected terms of 77-100 years and 97-100 years, and volatility based
on an analysis of peer companies of 697 percent for both years.
The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding
under all of the Company stock option plans at December 31, 1996:

1995 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
In 1995, the Company implemented the 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
1995 Stock Purchase Plan. Under the 1995 Stock Purchase Plan, eligible
employees will have the opportunity to purchase up to an aggregate of
200,000 shares of common stock. Shares of common stock purchased under the

Income tax benefits of $196,863 associated with the exercise of employee
stock options were credited to equity in 1996.
SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires a valuation allowance
when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred
income tax asset depends on the Company ability to generate sufficient
taxable income in the future. The Company has weighed the positive evidence
of sustained profitability over the last three years and future income
expectations within the Company three-year strategic planning horizon
against the negative evidence of dependence upon a limited number of
customers and other uncertainties and has concluded that retaining a
valuation allowance related to net operating losses is no longer necessary
at December 31, 1996. The remaining valuation allowance at December 31,
1996 relates to general business credits which expire sooner than net
operating loss carryforwards and realization is limited to years not
subject to the alternative minimum tax.
Significant changes in circumstances or in enacted tax laws which affect
the valuation allowance are recorded when they occur. The Company annual
strategic business planning process takes place in the fourth quarter of
the year, and the valuation allowance is adjusted for future years' income
expectations resulting from that process. When preparing subsequent interim
and annual financial statements, the Company reevaluates whether there has
been any significant change in the assumptions underlying its plan and
adjusts the valuation allowance as necessary. In the event the estimated
results are not achieved, an adjustment to the recorded deferred tax asset
could result and such adjustment could be material.
The changes in the valuation allowance at December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996
resulted primarily from current year utilization of net operating loss
carryforwards in excess of amounts estimated at the respective preceding
year ends together with changes in the Company estimate of the portion of
the deferred tax asset more likely than not to be realized in the future in
light of the factors described above.
