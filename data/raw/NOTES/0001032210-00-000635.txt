To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Data Critical Corporation  We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Data Critical Corporation
a Delaware corporation as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the related
statements of operations, stockholders' equity deficit and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Data Critical Corporation
as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Business
We design, manufacture, market, install and support communication and
information systems, using wireless and internet technology and proprietary
software to allow access to health information, including patient vital signs
and other diagnostic data, using wireless technology and proprietary software.
Our systems provide for information retrieval from remote sources, both inside
and outside the hospital environment, and are integrated and coordinated
through either a wireless network utilizing our interactive device, a personal
computer or the internet. Our focus within health care is on the hospital,
physician and at-home consumer markets. To date, the Company has directed a
significant portion of its efforts to research and development, development of
markets for its products, application for patents, raising capital and
planning. The Company performed selected contract development services during
this period as well as commenced sales of related products during 1995. During
1997, the Company focused on addressing its technology to specific medical
applications. The resulting products are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration and therefore require pre-market approval from the FDA prior to
making sales. The first of these approvals was granted in November 1997.
The Company commenced sales of its current products and services late in the
third quarter of 1997. The Company continues to face a number of risks similar
to other companies in a comparable stage of development including: reliance on
key personnel; successful marketing of its products; competition from other
companies with greater technical, financial, management and marketing
resources; successful development of new products and the enhancement of
existing products; and the ability to secure adequate financing to support
future growth, if and when required.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity when
purchased of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents
consist of cash on deposit with banks and money market investments.
Inventories
The Company initial medical product is made up of the Company
proprietary software applications which it integrates with hardware that is
acquired from third parties as well as hardware made by third parties to the
Company specifications. Inventories consist primarily of the Company
hardware product, components to make the product and other third-party
equipment, all of which is stated at the lower of cost or market, using the
first-in, first-out method.
Property, Equipment and Software
Property, equipment and software are stated at historical cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five
years. Ordinary repairs and maintenance and purchases of less than $500 are
expensed as incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of
the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Investment In and Advances To Unconsolidated Affiliate
The Company accounts for its investments in entities in which it owns less
than a 20% interest under the cost method.
46              DATA CRITICAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Other Assets
Other assets include licensed intellectual property rights and other
intangible assets which are stated at historical cost less accumulated
amortization provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives
of the asset, generally seven years. Other assets also includes technology
purchased in the Physix acquisition see Note 10, which are stated at their
fair market values at the acquisition date less accumulated amortization
provided on a straight-line basis over three years. Other assets also include
capitalized legal expenses associated with patent applications. These costs
will be amortized over their estimated useful lives upon patent issuance by
the U.S. Patent Office. Amortization expense on other assets was $15,000 19,000 and $34,000 in 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively. Accumulated
amortization was $27,000, $47,000 and $81,000 at December 31, 1997, 1998 and
1999, respectively.
Revenue Recognition
The Company revenue recognition policies are in conformity with Statement
of Position 97-2 Software Revenue Recognition as amended, of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants. License revenue is earned when
delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed and determinable, evidence of an
arrangement exists, collection of the receivable is probable and no
significant post-delivery obligations remain. For sales to end users, revenue
is recognized upon installation. For sales to distributors, revenue is
recognized upon delivery. Maintenance and support revenue is recognized over
the term of the agreement.
The Company recognizes revenue from software development contracts involving
significant production, modification or customization of software, based on
performance milestones specified in the contract where these milestones fairly
reflect progress toward contract completion.
Major Customers
In January 1997, Data Critical signed a distribution and license agreement
with GE Marquette Medical Systems, Inc. for the non-exclusive licensing and
distribution of a medical wireless data product. Approximately 383%, 545%
and 185% of the Company revenues for the years ended December 31, 1997,
1998 and 1999, respectively, is attributable to GE Marquette Medical Systems,
Inc. Approximately 203%, 447% and 721% of the Company revenue for the
years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively, is attributable to
Agilent Technologies, Inc. Agilent pursuant to a 1994 license agreement
which provided Agilent exclusive distribution rights to a specific
implementation of the Company medical wireless data technology. In September
1997, the 1994 license agreement between the Company and Agilent was
terminated by mutual agreement thus allowing the Company to sell directly to
Agilent customers. Approximately 221% of the Company revenue for the years
ended December 31, 1997, is attributable to federal and state governmental
agencies. The Company had no sales to federal and state governmental agencies
in 1998 or 1999.
Warranty Obligations
The Company generally provides product warranties for 12 months after date
of purchase. Estimated warranty obligations are provided at the time of the
sale of the Company products.
Royalty Expense
During 1997 and 1998, the Company entered into two nonexclusive licenses to
sell products using patented technology. In exchange for the licenses the
Company is required to make quarterly royalty payments based on the number of
products invoiced. Amounts charged to expense for the two nonexclusive
licenses were $14,000, $142,000 and $144,000 in 1997, 1998 and 1999,
respectively.
47              DATA CRITICAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Research and Development Costs
The Company accounting policy is to capitalize eligible computer software
development costs upon the establishment of technological feasibility, which
the Company has defined as completion of a working model. The amount of
eligible costs to be capitalized has not been material and accordingly, the
Company has charged all software development costs to research and development
in the accompanying statements of operations.
Advertising Costs
Costs related to advertising the Company products are expensed in the
period incurred. Advertising costs incurred during the years ended December
31, 1997, 1998 and 1999 were $31,600, $67,000 and $49,000, respectively.
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability
method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are
recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying
enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets
and liabilities. The effect on deferred taxes for a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. To date,
the Company has fully reserved for its net deferred tax assets.
Stock Options
The Company has adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. In
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123, the Company has elected the
disclosure only provisions related to employee stock options and follows the
provisions of Accounting Principals Board Opinion No. 25 APB 25 in
accounting for stock options issued to employees. Under APB 25, compensation
expense, if any, is recognized as the difference between the exercise price
and the fair value of the common stock on the measurement date, which is
typically the date of grant, and is recognized over the service period, which
is typically the vesting period.
The Company discloses the pro forma effect on net income as if it had
accounted for option grants to employees under the fair value method
prescribed by SFAS 123. The fair-value based model values stock options using
an acceptable valuation model. Pro forma compensation cost is measured at the
grant date based upon the fair value of the award and is recognized over the
service period, which is typically the vesting period.
Warrants and options granted to non-employees are accounted for under the
fair value provisions of SFAS 123.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist principally of cash and trade receivables. The risk for cash and
cash equivalents is limited by the Company policy of maintaining cash and
equivalents in multiple, highly rated, liquid investments. The Company has
credit risk regarding trade accounts receivables as most of these receivables
are with healthcare institutions or with distributors to healthcare
institutions. To mitigate this risk, the Company has a credit policy under
which it verifies the creditworthiness of its customers.
Financial Instruments
The Company enters into various types of financial instruments in the normal
course of business and in raising capital. Fair values of cash, trade
receivables, notes receivable and notes payable all approximate market
48              DATA CRITICAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
value. The fair value of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock at December
31, 1998, was estimated to be approximately $32,822,000. This estimate of fair
value was determined by management using recent sales of preferred stock,
consideration of significant milestones achieved by the Company and other
market considerations. The mandatorily redeemable preferred stock was
converted into common stock in November 1999.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Loss Per Share
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,
Computation of Earnings Per Share, basic loss per share is computed by
dividing net loss attributable to common stock net loss less preferred stock
redemption obligation accretion and dividend requirements by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted
average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding
during the period. Common equivalent shares consist of the shares of common
stock issuable upon the conversion of the mandatorily redeemable preferred
stock using the if-converted method and shares issuable upon the exercise of
stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method; common
equivalent shares are excluded from the calculation as their effect is
antidilutive. Accordingly, basic and diluted loss per share are equivalent.
The Company has not had any issuances or grants for nominal consideration as
defined under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting
Bulletin 98.
Segment Reporting
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131,
Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, SFAS
131 during 1998. SFAS 131 requires companies to disclose certain information
about operating segments. Based on the criteria within SFAS 131, the Company
has determined that it has one reportable segment, wireless data products.

1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Data Critical 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan was adopted by the board
of directors and approved by the stockholders in May 1999. 100,000 shares plus
an annual increase in each of the next five years equal to the lesser of
150,000 shares or one percent of the outstanding shares of common stock on the
last day of the preceding fiscal year of common stock have been reserved for
issuance under the Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 1999, no rights to
purchase stock under this plan had been granted by Data Critical.
The Purchase Plan, which is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the
Internal Revenue Code, will be implemented by a series of overlapping offering
periods of 24 months in duration, with new offering periods
52              DATA CRITICAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
other than the first offering period commencing on March 1 and September 1
of each year. Each offering period will consist of four consecutive purchase
periods of six months in duration. The initial offering period is expected to
commence on March 1, 2000.
The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock
through payroll deductions, which may not be less than 1% and not more than
20% of an employee compensation, at a price equal to the lower of 85% of the
fair market value of Data Critical common stock at the beginning of each
offering period or at the end of each purchase period. Employees may end their
participation in the offering at any time during the offering period, and
participation ends automatically on termination of employment with Data
Critical. If not terminated earlier, the Purchase Plan will have a term of 20
years.

These warrants generally expire within five years from grant 2000 to 2002.
The warrants were recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at
their estimated fair value at the date of issuance.
7. Stock Option Plan  The Company has three stock option plans, the 1994 Stock Plan, the 1999
Stock Plan and the 1999 Directors Stock Plan collectively, the Plans. The
1994 and 1999 Stock Plans provide for the grant of incentive and nonstatutory
stock options to employees, directors and consultants. The 1999 Directors
Stock Plan provides for the grant of nonstatutory stock options to non-
employee directors of the Company. Options generally terminate if unexercised
within 90 days after the employee leaves the company or, in the case of the
Directors Stock Plan, 90 days after the director ceases to be a director of
the Company.
Under the 1994 and 1999 Stock Plans, options generally become exercisable at
the rate of 25% of the total number of shares underlying the options 12 months
after the vesting commencement date, and 25% every 12 months thereafter.
Options generally expire no later than seven years after grant, or five years
in the case of an incentive stock option granted to a 10% stockholder.
Options granted under the Directors Stock Plan are fully vested at the date
of grant and expire 10 years after they are granted.
53              DATA CRITICAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Under the 1994 Plan, 950,000 shares of common stock were reserved for
issuance. No further options will be granted under the 1994 Stock Plan. Under
the 1999 Stock Plan, 1,000,000 shares plus an annual increase in each of the
next five years equal to the lesser of 250,000 shares or two percent of the
outstanding shares of common stock on the last day of the preceding fiscal
year of common stock have been reserved for issuance. Under the 1999 Directors
Stock Plan, 100,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance.
The Directors Plan provides that each person who is or becomes a nonemployee
director of Data Critical will be granted a nonstatutory stock option to
purchase 15,000 shares of common stock on the later of the date on which the
option holder first becomes a nonemployee director of Data Critical or the
date of the closing of this offering. Thereafter, on the date of our annual
stockholders' meeting each year, each nonemployee director of Data Critical
will be granted an additional option to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock
if, on that date, he or she has served on our board of directors for at least
six months.
Incentive options are granted at not less than the fair value of common
stock on the date of grant, and nonqualified options are granted at not less
than 50% of fair value on the date of grant. All options expire no later than
seven years from the date of grant.

and 556,292 shares were exercisable, respectively.
Under the Plans, options to purchase 416,737 shares of common stock were
available for future grant. As of December 31, 1999, the 1,523,999 options
outstanding under the 1994, 1999 and Director Stock Plan have exercise prices
between $080 and $1200 and a weighted-average remaining contractual life of
674 years. During 1998 and 1999, the Company recorded $605,000 and
$1,316,000, respectively, of deferred compensation from the issuance of stock
options with exercise prices less than the fair value of common stock. This
deferred compensation is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period
of the options. In 1998 and 1999, the Company recognized $53,000 and $541,000,
respectively, of expense related to this deferred compensation. Up to the
Company initial public offering the fair value of common stock on the dates
of stock option grants was determined by management using recent sales of
preferred stock, consideration of significant milestones achieved

For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of each
option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the minimum value method,
which considers the time-value of money, with the following assumptions for
grants in 1997, 1998 and 1999: risk-free interest rates of 625% to 650 expected lives of five years; and no dividends. The weighted average fair
value of options granted in 1997, 1998 and 1999 were $027, $058 and $738,
respectively. The volatility number used for those options granted between
December 9, 1999 and December 31, 1999 was 1018. The pro forma effect upon
net loss and net loss per share, taking into account only the additional
compensation expense that would be recognized using the fair value method, are

approximately $20,000,000. The Company may be limited in its ability to
utilize certain of its future carryforwards in any year due to previous sales
of its stock. Management believes that, based on a number of factors, the
available objective evidence creates significant uncertainty regarding the
realization of the net deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a valuation allowance
has been provided for the net deferred tax assets of the Company. This
valuation allowance increased in 1997, 1998 and 1999 by $1,417,000, $2,232,000
and $2,662,000 , respectively. These carryforwards, which may provide future
tax benefits, expire from 2008 to 2019.
The difference between the statutory tax rate of approximately 35% 34%
federal and 1% state, net of federal benefits and the tax benefit of zero
recorded by the Company is primarily due to the Company full valuation
against its net deferred tax assets.

On July 10, 1996, the Company loaned Nomadics, Inc. $50,000 in exchange for
a promissory note, which matures on July 10, 2000. The note is convertible
into approximately a 36% equity interest in Nomadics, Inc., at the earlier of
July 10, 2000 or upon an initial public offering of the Company stock.
Interest accrues at 80% per year. On November 7, 1996, the Company acquired

10. Acquisitions  On December 17, 1999, the Company acquired substantially all of the
business, assets and rights of Physix, Inc. Physix. Under the terms of the
agreement the Company issued 200,000 shares of common stock, all of which were
placed in escrow. Of these 200,000 shares, 100,000 shares will be released if
not required to satisfy Physix indemnification obligations, and the other
100,000 shares the contingency shares will only be released upon the
achievement of certain milestone obligations. If these performance milestones
are not met within one year, the number of contingency shares to be released
to Physix will be reduced on a sliding scale, up to the total 100,000 shares,
and the unreleased shares will be returned to the Company for retirement. The
Company also paid approximately $15 million in cash to repay certain Physix
obligations and assumed certain other Physix liabilities amounting to
approximately $600,000.
This acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the
financial statements reflect valuation of all assets, including identifiable
intangibles, at their estimated fair market values. Physix results of
operations are included in the accompanying statement of operations from the
date of the acquisition.
