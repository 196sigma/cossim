Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  1The Company  Keynote Systems, Inc. was incorporated on June15, 1995 in California and reincorporated in Delaware on March31, 2000. Keynote Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company provides technology based services that
enable corporate enterprises to improve their online business performance and communications technologies.  2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  ABasis of Presentation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America GAAP. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its domestic and foreign subsidiaries. Significant intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  Certain amounts for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 as reported on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations, and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. The Company reclassified approximately $94 million in auction rate
securities from cash and cash equivalents to short-term investments as of September30, 2004. The Company also reclassified $36 million in auction rate securities from cash and cash equivalents to short-term investments as of
September30, 2003. The reclassifications resulted in decreased cash flows from investing activities of $58 million and $31 million in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended September30, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The reclassification of short-term investments is based on the latest interpretation of cash equivalents pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No95 SFAS 95, Statement of
Cash Flows.  The Company also reclassified revenue
related to its Keynote Diagnostic Services from subscription services revenue to professional services revenue, and reclassified associated expenses from costs of subscription services and costs of professional services to operations expense for the
years ended September30, 2004 and 2003 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations to conform to the current year presentation.  BRevenue Recognition  Revenue consists of subscription services revenue and professional services revenue. Subscription services revenue consists of fees from subscriptions to
the Companys e-business service level management and customer experience management services. Professional services revenue consists of fees generated by the Companys professional services. Revenue related to the use of our WebEffective
Intelligence Platform is accounted for as either subscription services revenue or professional services revenue depending upon its use.  The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB 104, Revenue Recognition, and Emerging Issue
Task Force EITF Issue 00-21 Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables EITF 00-21.  Subscription and professional services revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is deemed reasonably assured. The Company evaluates each of these criteria as follows:  Evidence of an arrangement.The Company considers a signed quote, contract, or equivalent document to be evidence of an arrangement.
Delivery.For subscription services, delivery is considered to occur when the customer has been provided with access to the
subscription services. The Companys subscription services are generally 
54 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
delivered on a consistent basis over the period of the subscription. For professional services, delivery is considered to occur when the services are
completed, or in some cases, as milestones are reached to recognize the proportional performance of the services.  Fixed or determinable fee.The Company considers the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and payment
terms are standard.  Collection is deemed reasonably assured.Collection is deemed reasonably assured if it is expected that the client will be able to pay amounts under
the arrangement as payments become due. If it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured, then revenue is deferred and recognized upon cash collection.  Deferred revenue is comprised of all unearned revenue that has been collected in advance, primarily unearned subscription
services revenue, and is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until the revenue is earned. Any uncollected deferred revenue reduces the balance of accounts receivable. The Company does not generally grant refunds. All discounts granted
reduce revenue. Revenue is not recognized for free trial periods.  Subscription Services Revenue:For customers that pay in advance, subscription services revenue is deferred upon invoicing and is recognized ratably over the service period, generally ranging from one to
twelve months, commencing on the day service is first provided. For customers billed in arrears, subscription services revenue is invoiced monthly upon completion of the services. If a customer purchases a subscription to the Companys
WebEffective Intelligence Platform, revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period, commencing on the day service is first provided, and recorded as subscription services revenue.  Professional Services
Revenue:Professional services revenue consists of fees generated by the Companys professional services, and is recognized as the services are performed, typically over a period of one to three months. For most
professional service projects that span more than one month, the Company recognizes revenue once the services have been delivered, or in some cases when milestones or deliverables are complete as this is its estimate of the outputs to recognize the
proportional performance under such contracts. If the WebEffective Intelligence Platform is used to conduct evaluations for consulting engagements, revenue is recognized upon the completion of the evaluation and recorded as professional services
revenue.  On limited occasions, the Company enters into
arrangements with multiple elements, which include both subscription and professional service revenue. For these arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with EITF 00-21 and allocates and defers revenue for the undelivered items
based on vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered elements, and recognizes the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. VSOE of each element is
based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately. The Company determines fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand-alone sales of these elements to third parties. When VSOE does not exist
for undelivered items, then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period.  CUse of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated
financial statements relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
55 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
DCash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers all highly liquid investments held at major banks,
commercial paper, money market mutual funds and other money market securities with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  EShort-Term Investments  The Company classifies all of its short-term investments as available-for-sale. These investments mature in two years or less, and consist of
investment-grade corporate and government debt securities with Moodys ratings of A2 or better. Investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated
other comprehensive income loss, a component of stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses are recorded based on specific identification. The Company did not have any realized gains or losses for the twelve months ended
September30, 2005 and 2003, and realized a gain of approximately $7,000 for the twelve months ended September30, 2004. FProperty and Equipment  Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally three years. Equipment under capital leases is amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the equipment or the lease term. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term. The cost of the Companys building is being depreciated over a thirty-year life.  GComprehensive Income Loss  Comprehensive income loss includes net income loss, unrealized gains and losses on short-term investments in debt securities and foreign currency
translation. The unrealized gains and losses on short-term investments in debt securities and foreign currency translation are excluded from earnings and reported as a component of stockholders equity. The Company has subsidiaries located in
France, United Kingdom and Canada. The functional currency of the Companys foreign operations is the applicable local currency. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities related to these operations are translated at the current exchange rates at
the end of each period. The resulting cumulative translation adjustments are recorded directly to the accumulated other comprehensive income loss account in stockholders equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates
in effect during the period. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are reflected in interest and other expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as incurred.  HFinancial Instruments and Concentration of
Credit Risk  The carrying value of the Companys
financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and capital lease obligation, approximates fair market value due to their short-term nature. Financial
instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable.  Credit risk is concentrated in North America, but exists in Europe as well. The Company generally requires no collateral
from customers; however, throughout the collection process, it conducts an ongoing evaluation of customers ability to pay. The Companys accounting for its allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based 
56 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
on historical trends, experience and current market and industry conditions. Management regularly reviews the adequacy of the Companys allowance for
doubtful accounts by considering the aging of accounts receivable, the age of each invoice, each customers expected ability to pay and the Companys collection history with each customer. Management reviews invoices greater than 60 days
past due to determine whether an allowance is appropriate based on the receivable balance. In addition, the Company maintains a reserve for all other invoices, which is calculated by applying a percentage to the outstanding accounts receivable
balance, based on historical collection trends. In addition to the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company maintains a billing allowance that represents the reservefor potential billing adjustments that are recorded as a reduction of
revenue. The Companys accounting for billing allowance represents a percentage of revenue based on historical trends and experience.  The allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance represent managements best current estimate, but changes in circumstances relating to
accounts receivable and billing adjustments, including unforeseen declines in market conditions and collection rates and the number of billing adjustments, may result in additional allowances or recoveries in the future. The Company believes that it
has adequately reserved for doubtful accounts and potential billing adjustments as of the date of each balance sheet presented herein. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts and billing adjustment is as follows in thousands:  Classification Period
BalanceAtBeginningOf Period

For the year ended September30, 2005 758 171 395 534
September30, 2004 1,048 216 506 758
September30, 2003 1,238 525 715 1,048 1
Included in the balance at the end of the period is an amount of $381,000, $541,000 and $560,000 in billing adjustments as of September30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
At September30, 2005, one customer
accounted for 12% of the Companys total accounts receivable of which 100% of this customers balance was subsequently received. At September30, 2004, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys total
accounts receivable. For the years ended September30, 2005, 2004, and 2003, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. For the years ended September30, 2005, 2004, and 2003, 35%, 34% and 30% of total revenue was
generated by the ten largest customers, respectively.  IExcess Occupancy Costs  Excess occupancy costs are fixed expenses associated with the portion of the Companys headquarters building not occupied by Keynote, such as property taxes, insurance, and depreciation. These particular costs represent the fixed
costs of operating the Companys headquarters building acquired in September 2002 and are based on the actual unoccupied square footage, which was determined to be 60%, 70%, and 60% for the twelve months ended September30, 2005 and 2004,
and the nine months ended June30, 2003, respectively, and 70% during the three months ended September30, 2003. These particular costs are reduced by the rental income from the leasing of space not occupied by the Company in our
headquarters building. Rental income was approximately $655,000, $253,000 and $35,000 for the years ended September30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As of September30, 2005, the Company had 
57 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
leased space with nine tenants of which seven had noncancellable operating leases, which expire on various dates through 2010. At September30, 2005,
future minimum rents receivable under the leases, are as follows in thousands:  Year ending September30 2006 964

2008 914
2009 667
2010 176
Thereafter Total future minimum rents receivable 3,704  JGoodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets  Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed. Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are
accounted for in accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142. Under SFAS 142, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are reviewed annually for
impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over a three-or four-year period. SFAS No142 also
requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.  The Company
tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable, or at least annually at September30 of each year. These tests are performed at
the reporting unit level using a two-step, fair-value based approach. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying
amount, a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. The second step allocates the fair value of the reporting unit to the Companys tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. This derives an implied fair value for
the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess. The Company has determined that it has only one
reporting unit.  In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company
completed the annual impairment tests and concluded that no impairment existed at September30, 2005.  Amortization of identifiable intangible assets was $24 million, $17 million, and $16 million for the years ended September30, 2005, 2004, and
2003, respectively. KStock-Based
Compensation  The Company currently measures compensation
expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB Opinion No25 APB No25. The Company applies the disclosure
provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, SFAS No123 as amended by SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure SFAS
No148 as if the fair-value-based method had been 
58 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
applied in measuring compensation expense. Under APB No25, no compensation expense is recognized when the exercise price of the Companys
employee stock options equals or exceeds the market price of the underlying common stock on the grant date.  As required under SFAS No123, the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation on net income loss and income loss per share for employee stock
options granted and employee stock purchase plan share purchases have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated
fair value of the options is amortized to pro forma net income loss over the options vesting period.  The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of freely traded options that have no vesting restrictions and
are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of options and the Companys expected stock price volatility. Because the Companys employee stock
options and employee stock purchase plan shares have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
managements opinion, the existing models do not provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Companys employee stock options.  The following table illustrates the effect on net income loss and basic and diluted net income loss per share if the Company had accounted for its
stock option and stock purchase plans under the fair value method of accounting under SFAS No123 as amended by SFAS No148, in thousands, except per share amounts  Year Ended September30 2005 2004 2003 Net income loss, as reported 7,365 4,647 4,725 Add: Stock-based employee compensation included in net income loss 31 Less: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax

The amounts reflected
as stock-based employee compensation included in pro forma net loss for the year ended September30, 2003 have been revised from the historically reported amounts. The revision was required to correct an immaterial error in these amounts
associated with the Companys April 2001 Stock Repurchase Program under SFAS No123.  LIncome Taxes  Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The 
59 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation
allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that the Company expects to realize.  MResearch and Development  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility, defined as a working prototype, has been established, in
accordance with SFAS No86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed. To date, the Companys service offerings have been available for general release concurrent with the
establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, no research and development costs have been capitalized.  NNet Income Loss Per Share  Basic net income loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock excluding shares of restricted stock
subject to repurchase, summarized below. Diluted net income loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and, when dilutive, potential shares from options to purchase common stock using the
treasury stock method.  The following table sets forth the
computation of basic and diluted income loss per share in thousands, except per share amounts:  Year Ended September30 2005

OAdvertising Costs  All advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were
approximately $426,000, $168,000 and $598,000 for the years ended September30, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.  PRecent Accounting Pronouncements  In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No153, Exchanges of
Nonmonetary Assets, SFAS No153 which eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial
substance. SFAS No153 will be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2005. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFASNo153 will have a material impact on its
financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.  In
May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections SFAS 154 which replaces APB Opinion No20 Accounting Changes and SFAS No3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim
Financial StatementAn Amendment of APB Opinion No28. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principal unless it is not practicable. SFAS 154 is
effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005 and is required to be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Although the Company will continually evaluate
its accounting policies, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123 Revised 2004, Share-Based Payment, SFAS
No123R and in March 2005, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No107, Topic 14: Share-Based Payment, that address the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives
employee services in exchange for aequity instruments of the enterprise or bliabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments.
These new rules eliminate the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and generally would require instead that such
transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company has determined that it will value its options using the Black-Scholes model and will use the modified prospective transition method that requires compensation expense be
recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock as the requisite service is rendered beginning with the first quarter of adoption.SFAS 123R and SAB 107 will be effective October1, 2005, which is the first quarter of fiscal
year 2006. Management expects the adoption to have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, but will not impact the Companys cash flows or financial position.  In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 109-1 Application of FASB Statement No109,
Accounting for Income Taxes, FAS 109-1 to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The American Jobs Creation Act AJCA introduces a special
9% tax deduction on qualified production activities. FAS 109-1 clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special tax deduction in accordance with SFAS 109. Pursuant to the AJCA, the Company will not be able to claim this tax
benefit until the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of these new tax provisions to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 109-2
Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004 FAS 
61 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
109-2, The AJCA introduces a limited time 85% dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpaper
repatriation provision, provided certain criteria are met. FAS 109-2 provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. The deduction is subject to several limitations and requirements, including adoption of a specific
domestic reinvestment plan for the repatriated funds. Based on current understanding of the Act and subsequent guidance published by the U.S. Treasury, the Company has not determined that it is eligible and does not presently intend to repatriate
dividends subject to the elective 85% dividends received deduction.  3Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments  The following table summarizes the Companys cash and cash equivalents as of September30, 2005 in thousands:  AmortizedCost

determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. The declines in value of these investments is primarily related to changes in interest rates and are considered to be temporary in nature because the Company intends to hold the
investments until maturity. Investments are reviewed periodically to identify possible impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the
financial condition of the investee, and the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value.  4Property and Equipment  Property and equipment, net, comprised the following in thousands:

The Incentive Plan provides for the award of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards and stock bonuses.
Options may be exercisable only as they vest or may be immediately exercisable with the shares issued subject to the Companys right of repurchase that lapses as the shares vest. In general, options vest over a four-year period. As of
September30, 2005, the Company was authorized to issue up to approximately 99million shares of common stock in connection with the Incentive Plan to employees, directors, and consultants, which includes options reserved for issuance
under the Companys 1996 and 1999 Stock Option Plans, which plans terminated upon the completion of the Companys initial public offering. As of September30, 2005, options to purchase approximately 62million shares were
outstanding under the Incentive Plan, and approximately 30million shares were available for future issuance under the Incentive Plan.  Stock options granted prior to April 1999 were generally immediately exercisable subject to a restricted stock purchase agreement whereby the Company has
the right to repurchase the unvested portion of the shares upon the voluntary or involuntary termination of the purchasers employment with the Company at the original issuance cost. The Companys right of repurchase lapsed with respect to
25% of the shares after one year and ratably on a monthly basis over the following three years. As of September30, 2005, the Companys right of repurchase had lapsed for all shares granted prior to April 1999.  Under the Incentive Plan, the exercise price for incentive stock options is
at least 100% of the stocks fair market value on the date of the grant for employees owning less than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock, and at least 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant for employees owning more
than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock. For nonqualified stock options, the exercise price must be at least 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant for employees owning more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of
stock and no less than 85% for employees owning less than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock. Options expire 10 years after the date of grant.  B1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan  In September 1999, the Company adopted the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Purchase Plan. The Company had
reserved a total of approximately 14million shares of common stock for issuance under the Purchase Plan as of September30, 2005.  Under the Purchase Plan, eligible employees may defer an amount not to exceed 10% of the employees compensation, as defined in the Purchase Plan, to
purchase common stock of the Company. The purchase price 
65 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
per share is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of the applicable purchase period or the last day of each
purchase period. The Purchase Plan is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section423 of the Internal Revenue Code. As of September30, 2005, approximately 636,000 shares had been issued under the
Purchase Plan, and approximately 787,000 shares had been reserved for future issuance.  CStock-Based Compensation  The Company issues stock options to its employees and outside directors and provides employees with stock purchase rights pursuant to stockholder approved equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans. The
Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans under the intrinsic value method of accounting as defined by Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No25, and related interpretations. Accordingly, no stock-based employee compensation
cost is reflected in operating expenses for the three years ended September30, 2005, as all options granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to or in excess of the fair market value of the underlying common stock as of the grant
date for each stock option, except for certain stock options granted in fiscal 1999 or earlier, prior to the Companys initial public offering. For those option grants in fiscal 1999 or earlier, the Company recorded deferred stock compensation
of $19 million for the difference at the grant date between the exercise price of each stock option granted and the fair value of the underlying common stock. This amount was being amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which
was generally four years. As of September30, 2004, the deferred stock compensation was fully amortized.  The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Weighted-average assumptions for options
granted under the equity incentive plans for the years ended September30, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, are as follows:  2005 2004 2003 Volatility

DStock Repurchase Plan  In January 2001, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $500 million of the Companys outstanding common stock on the open market from time to time as market conditions warrant. In October 2002, the Companys Board of Directors increased the amount authorized for repurchase
to an aggregate of $1300 million of the Companys outstanding common stock on the open market, less the amount paid for shares previously purchased.  During fiscal 2003, the Company completed two issuer tender offers for a total of 86million shares for an aggregate price of approximately $751
million.  On January27, 2005, the Company entered into an
agreement with UBS Securities LLC UBS to establish a trading plan the Trading Plan intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act. The Trading Plan instructs
UBS to repurchase for the Company, in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, up to 2million shares of the Companys common stock, representing approximately 10% of the Companys outstanding common stock, over a period of
twelve months commencing as early as March1, 2005.  In
accordance with the January 2001 share repurchase authorization, the Company acquired approximately 19million and 89million shares of common stock in fiscal 2005 and 2003, respectively. No repurchases occurred during fiscal 2004. The
Company retired approximately 10million and approximately 98million shares of treasury stock repurchased in fiscal 2005 and 2003, respectively. No retirement of treasury stock occurred during fiscal 2004.  Pursuant to the 2001 stock repurchase program, the total number of shares
repurchased since January 2001 is approximately 123million shares, for an aggregate price of approximately $113 million. As of September30, 2005, the Company had authorization to repurchase up to an additional $17 million of its common
stock pursuant to this stock repurchase program.  In October
2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved the repurchase of an additional 10million shares of the Companys common stock under this repurchase program.  EStock Option Exchange Program  In April 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock option
exchange program. The Company offered its employees other than its Chief Executive Officer, executive officers who report to the Chief Executive Officer, directors and non-exempt employees the opportunity to cancel certain stock options granted on
or after September24, 1999, with exercise prices above the then-current market value of the Companys common stock, in exchange for new options to be granted at the then-fair market value on a date at least six months and one day after
the options were cancelled. Options to purchase a total of approximately 12million shares were cancelled pursuant to this program on May8, 2001. On November12, 2001, the Company granted new options to purchase a total of
approximately 12million shares at $752 per share. FStockholder Rights Plan  On October28, 2002, the Company announced that its Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan. The plan was amended on December15, 2003. The plan is designed to protect the long-term value of the Company for its
stockholders during any future unsolicited acquisition attempt. The rights become exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the plan, including the acquisition of 20% of the Companys outstanding common stock by a
person or group. The Companys Board of Directors adopted a 
68 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
policy under which a committee consisting solely of independent directors of the Board will review the Rights Agreement at least once every three years to
consider whether maintaining the Rights Agreement continues to be in the best interests of Keynote and its stockholders. The Board may amend the terms of the rights without the approval of the holders of the rights.  8Acquisitions  During the three fiscal years ended September30, 2005, the Company
completed several acquisitions. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented for any of the acquisitions, except for Vividence Corporation, because these other acquisitions did not constitute significant acquisitions and were not material
to Keynote on either an individual or an aggregate annual basis. The results of operations of each purchase acquisition are included in the Companys consolidated statement of operations from the date of acquisition.  On February1, 2005, the Company acquired Hudson Williams Europe
HWE, a privately held online business performance consulting firm based in the Netherlands, for an initial purchase price of approximately $260,000 plus direct transaction costs of $131,000. An initial cash payment of approximately
$210,000 was made to HWE as of the closing date. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, approximately $50,000 of the purchase price is being held back and will be released on January31, 2006. An additional contingent consideration cash
payment of $82,000 was accrued as an addition to goodwill as of September30, 2005 since profitability targets were achieved by HWE through June30, 2005. The Company believes that this acquisition provides its European customers the same
range of management solutions that it has been offering in North America. The purchase price allocation was based on the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the acquisition date, including customer-based intangible assets
acquired.  The purchase price of $473,000, which includes
direct acquisition costs, was allocated as follows: in thousands:  Cash 70 Accounts receivable 121 Prepaid and other assets 37 Customer-based intangible assets 64 Goodwill 290 Liabilities assumed Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 85 Deferred revenue 24 Total purchase price, including direct acquisition costs 473  In September 2004, the
Company acquired Vividence Corporation Vividence, a provider of Web-based customer experience management for an initial cash payment of $200 million plus direct transaction costs of $572,000. The initial purchase price of $200
million was reduced by approximately $400,000 which represented the preliminary difference between Vividences total assets and liabilities net assets as of the acquisition date after taking account of certain adjustments as
defined in the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated September10, 2004. An additional contingent consideration payment of up to $60 million in cash would be made if certain revenue and profitability targets were achieved by the acquired
business through September30, 2005. Based on revenue and profitability achieved by the acquired business, no additional cash payments will be made since the revenue target goals were not achieved through September30, 2005. The Company
believes that this acquisition enhances and broadens its customer experience management solutions for enterprise customers as well as allows it to target e-business marketing executives within Fortune 500 companies such as usability and market
research managers. 
69 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
In fiscal 2005, the Company and the Shareholders Representative of the former shareholders of
Vividence worked with a third party tax consultant in resolving several pre-acquisition sales and use tax matters. Any payment, if the tax matter was resolved by September 2005, was the subject to a claim against the escrow by the Company. As of
September30, 2005, the Company estimated that the sales and use tax matters would result in payments of $120,000 of which $82,000 has been incurred and paid and the remaining $38,000 has been recorded as an accrued liability. As of
September30, 2005, the Company also prepaid approximately $209,000 for pre-acquisition income tax and other matters. Therefore, the Company has submitted a claim for $329,000 against escrow.  The initial purchase price allocation was based on the estimated fair value
of the assets and liabilities acquired at the acquisition date, including technology-based and customer-based intangible assets acquired. For the twelve months ended September30, 2005, total net adjustments of $468,000 were made to the fair
value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date which had the net impact of decreasing goodwill. In the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company and the Shareholders Representative of Vividence finalized the
amount representing the net assets as of the acquisition date, resulting in a final net asset shortfall of approximately $38,000 which had a net impact of decreasing goodwill. During the twelve months ended September30, 2005, a net adjustment
of $33,000 to prepaid and other assets had the net impact of increasing goodwill. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company further adjusted goodwill as it reduced the initial purchase price allocations for deferred revenue and certain
accruals by $463,000.  Additionally, in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005, the Company reduced goodwill by approximately $47 million associated with the partial recognition of its net deferred tax assets related to net operating losses that arose from the Vividence acquisition which were not recognized
previously for accounting purposes. Refer to Note 9 for further information regarding the partial recognition of the Companys net deferred tax assets.  The total purchase price has been allocated as follows in thousands:  Cash 678 Accounts receivable 431 Prepaid and other assets 510 Property and equipment 86 Customer-based intangible assets 1,680 Technology-based intangible assets 2,780 In-process research and development 241 Goodwill 13,198 Deferred tax assets 4,737 Liabilities assumed Line of credit 723 Deferred revenue 1,704 Accrued employee compensation 937 Other liabilities assumed 843 Total purchase price, including direct acquisition costs 20,134

The in-process research and development expense of $241,000 is related to the estimated fair value of
an acquired in-process research and development project in connection with the acquisition of Vividence. This project is related to Vividences technology for its Web-based customer research, which had not yet reached technological feasibility
and had no alternative future use. The estimated fair value of this project was determined based on the avoided cost approach as of the acquisition date where the fair value of the acquired technology was equal to the costs which an acquirer would
avoid spending in developing a similar functional technology. This amount was immediately expensed as of the acquisition date during the three months ended September30, 2004. This Web-based customer research technology became generally

an unaudited pro-forma basis, reflects consolidated results of operations for the years ended September30, 2004 and 2003, assuming Vividence had been acquired at the beginning of the periods presented, in thousands, except per share data:

Company acquired Hudson Williams Corporation Hudson Williams, a provider of performance management and load testing consulting services for cash payments of approximately $22 million. In addition to the cash payments for the
acquisition of Hudson Williams, the Company incurred direct acquisition costs of approximately $140,000. Pursuant to the merger agreement, an additional payment related to the cost of the acquisition of approximately $240,000 was paid in July 2005.
The Company believes this acquisition enhances and broadens its enterprise solutions group and provides customers in the northeast with more local access to Keynote expertise.  In April 2004, the Company acquired NetRaker Corporation NetRaker, a provider of online customer experience
management solutions that help e-business managers measure, evaluate and improve the design and navigability of their Web sites. The initial price of approximately $37 million included $31 million in cash payments made in April 2004, and
approximately $553,000 of direct acquisition costs. The Company believes this acquisition enhances and broadens its customer experience management solutions for enterprise customers as well as allow it to target e-business marketing executives
within Fortune 500 companies, such as usability and market research managers.  The preliminary purchase price allocation was based on the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the business at the acquisition date, including technology-based and customer-based intangible assets
acquired. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated April2, 2004 Agreement and Plan, an additional contingent cash payment of up to $79 million could be made if certain revenue and profitability targets were
achieved by the acquired business during the twelve months ended March31, 2005. The Company estimated that a cash payment of approximately $1,675,000 was earned by the acquired business pursuant to the earnout provisions of the Agreement and
Plan. Two of the former stockholders of Netraker disputed the amounts to be paid under the Agreement and Plan and a settlement agreement was reached in August 2005. As a result of settling this matter, a total additional cash payment of $21 million
was paid, of which $1,675,000 was recorded 
71 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
as an addition to goodwill, and the remaining amount of $463,000 was recorded as a General and Administrative expense. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005,
the Company received $463,000 from its insurance carrier related to this matter, and this amount was reflected as a reduction to General and Administrative expenses.  An additional adjustment of $16,000 was also recorded in the year ended September30, 2005 to reduce goodwill and
deferred revenue to reflect an adjustment in a customer contract that was not considered in the original purchase price allocation. The purchase price was allocated as follows in thousands:  Cash 12 Accounts receivable 150 Prepaid and other assets 104 Property and equipment 20 Customer-based intangible assets 165 Technology-based intangible assets 512 Goodwill 5,781 Liabilities assumed 870 Deferred revenue 516 Total purchase price, including direct acquisition costs 5,358  In July 2003, the
Company acquired the business of Streamcheck, a provider of quality measurement services for streaming media, for $567,000 in cash, and an additional contingent consideration cash payment of $450,000 if certain revenue and profitability targets were
achieved during the period from July22, 2003 through September30, 2004. In January 2005, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated July22, 2003, certain targets were obtained and an additional contingent cash payment of
approximately $129,000 was made to Candescent Software Inc. Candescent based on the achievement of certain revenue and profitability targets attained by the purchased business, Streamcheck. This additional payment was recorded as an
addition to goodwill as of September30, 2004. The purchase price was allocated as follows in thousands:  Fixed assets 21

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the Companys
deferred tax assets are presented below in thousands:  September30 2005 2004 2003 Deferred tax assets Accruals, reserves and other 1,208 1,544 1,188 Capitalized research and development 3,276 526 316 State taxes 31 39 54 Intangibles related to acquisition 5,552 5,790 6,160 Property and equipment 23,729 23,495 23,964 Net operating loss carryforwards 21,379 22,891 16,129 Tax credit carryforwards 2,288 2,789 1,930 Gross deferred tax assets 57,463 57,074 49,741 Valuation allowance 48,742 55,231 49,741 Total deferred tax assets 8,721 1,843 Deferred tax liabilities Intangible assets 1,321 1,843 Total net deferred tax assets 7,400  Management has
established a valuation allowance for the portion of deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the years ended September30, 2005 and 2004 was a decrease and increase of
approximately $65 million and $55 million, respectively. The Companys accounting for deferred taxes under SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the
realizability of the Companys deferred tax assets. Assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon several factors, including the likelihood and amount, if any, of future taxable income in relevant jurisdictions during the
periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Companys management forecasts taxable income by considering all available positive and negative evidence including its history of operating income or losses and its financial
plans and estimates which are used to manage the business. These assumptions require significant judgment about future taxable income. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of
future taxable income are reduced. At present, the Companys management believes that it is more likely than not that $74 million of deferred tax assets will be realized in the forseeable future; accordingly, a deferred tax asset is shown in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and a partial valuation allowance has been established against the remaining deferred tax assets.  As of September30, 2005, the Company has recognized approximately $31 million of income tax benefit and approximately $47 million as a reduction
in goodwill associated with the partial recognition of its net deferred assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 based on the following factors:  The Company has demonstrated profitability in nine of its most recent quarters, and  The Companys management believes that it is more likely than not that $74 million of deferred tax assets will be realized in the forseeable future. 
The $31 million benefit was partially offset by $437,000 related to the
pre-acquisition net operating loss carryforwards of Vividence, Inc. that were utilized in fiscal 2005, and $354,000 of current tax expense, resulting in a net tax benefit of approximately $23 million. 
74 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
The $47 million of the deferred tax asset recorded as a reduction of goodwill included $437,000
related to the preacquisition net operating loss carryforwards of Vividence, Inc. utilized in fiscal 2005. The remaining $43 million reduction to goodwill was based on the future projected taxable income and reflects the Companys partial
recognition of deferred tax assets. Any subsequent decreases in the valuation allowance related to the acquired deferred tax benefits will also be recorded as a reduction in goodwill.  As of September30, 2005, approximately $73 million of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is attributable
to employee stock option deductions, the benefit from which will be allocated to paid-in-capital if and when determined to be realizable.  Deferred tax liabilities and foreign withholding taxes have not been recognized for undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because it is
managements intention to indefinitely reinvest such undistributed earnings outside the United States.  The Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $55 million, available to reduce future income subject
to income taxes. The federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire, if not utilized, in the years 2017 through 2023. In addition, the Company had approximately $220 million of net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future
taxable income, for state income tax purposes. The state net operating loss carryforwards will expire, if not utilized, in the years 2006 through 2013.  As of September30, 2005, the Company had research credit carryforwards of approximately $14 million for both federal and state income tax purposes
individually available to reduce future income taxes. The federal research credit carryforwards begin to expire in the year 2010. The California research credit carryforwards are available indefinitely.  Federal and state tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization
of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for tax purposes, as defined in Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has preliminarily determined that ownership changes have
occurred, and the effects of the limitations have been included in the loss and credit carryforwards. If an ownership change has occurred at different dates or in addition to the dates preliminarily identified, the utilization of net operating loss
and credit carryforwards could be significantly reduced.  The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act was enacted in October 2004, and it creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings by providing an elective 85% dividends received deduction for
certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations, with the balance of 15% taxed at regular rates with no offset for loss carryovers. The deduction is subject to several limitations and requirements, including adoption of a specific domestic
reinvestment plan for the repatriated funds. Based on current understanding of the Act and subsequent guidance published by the U.S. Treasury, the Company has not determined that it is eligible and does not presently intend to repatriate dividends
subject to the elective 85% dividends received deduction.  The
Companys management establishes liabilities or reserves when it believes that certain tax positions are likely to be challenged and it may not succeed, despite managements belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable. The
tax reserves are adjusted, as well as related interest, in light of changing circumstances such as the progress of tax exams. Accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No5, Accounting
for Contingencies. Through the fiscal year ended September30, 2005, net income tax liabilities totaling approximately $249,000 related to foreign taxes were recorded. Although the Companys management believes that the estimates and
assumptions supporting the assessments are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that 
75 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities. Due to the complexity involved, the Companys management is
not able to estimate the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts recorded.  10Commitments and Contingencies  ALeases  The Company leases certain of its facilities and equipment under noncancellable capital and operating leases, which expire on various dates through August
2015. At September30, 2005, future minimum payments under the leases, are as follows in thousands:  Operating
Capital Year ending September 30 2006 452 40 2007 347 19 2008 279 10 2009 255 2010 261 Thereafter 1,382 Total minimum lease payments 2,976 69 Less amounts representing interest 2 Present value of minimum lease payments 67 Less current portion of obligation under capital lease 40 Obligations under capital leases, less current portion 27  Rent expense was
$483,000, $264,000 and $223,000 for the years ended September30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The Company had contingent commitments, which range in length from one to twelve months, to 118 bandwidth and collocation providers amounting to $726,000
in the aggregate for 108 locations, which commitments become due if the Company terminates any of these agreements prior to their expiration.  BLegal Proceedings  Beginning on August16, 2001, several class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
against the Company, certain of its officers, and the underwriters of its initial public offering. These lawsuits were essentially identical, and were brought on behalf of those who purchased the Companys securities between September24,
1999 and August19, 2001. These complaints alleged generally that the underwriters in certain initial public offerings, including the Companys, allocated shares in those initial public offerings in unfair or unlawful ways, such as
requiring the purchaser to agree to buy in the aftermarket at a higher price or to buy shares in other companies with higher than normal commissions. The complaint also alleged that the Company had a duty to disclose the activities of the
underwriters in the registration statement relating to its initial public offering. The plaintiffs counsel and the issuer defendants counsel have reached a preliminary settlement agreement whereby the issuers and individual defendants
were dismissed from the case, without any payments by the Company. The settlement was preliminarily approved and awaits final approval by the Court. No amount is accrued as September30, 2005 and September30, 2004, as the Company
anticipates that it will be dismissed from the case as a result of the settlement. 
76 Table of Contents Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
On February15, 2005, individuals George A. Papazian and Douglas K. van Duyne filed the action
Papazian, et al. v. Keynote Systems, Inc., et al., Case No. CIV 444884 in Superior Court of San Mateo County against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer, Umang Gupta. The complaint asserted claims of fraud, breach of contract, and unfair
business practices against Keynote and fraud against Mr.Gupta in connection with the Companys April2, 2004 acquisition of Netraker Corporation. The complaint also alleged that the Company precluded plaintiffs from maximizing their
earn-out under the terms of the acquisition agreement. The complaint sought rescission of the agreement, unspecified monetary and punitive damages, and equitable relief in the form of restitution and disgorgement of any profits. On March28,
2005, the Company and Mr.Gupta demurred to the complaint and moved to strike portions thereof. Plaintiffs initiated the lawsuit with allegations in good faith. The parties have resolved the case on a mutually satisfactory basis. Based on the
facts developed through investigation and discovery, plaintiffs have agreed to dismiss all claims, including the fraud allegations. The matter was settled pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement between the parties on July25, 2005.
The Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and
litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, management does not expect that the ultimate costs toresolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  CIndemnification  The Company does not generally indemnify customers for its measuring, monitoring and testing Web-based applications against legal claims that its products and services infringe on third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements
entered into by the Company may include indemnification provisions that could subject the Company to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has never been a
party to an infringement claim and its management is not aware of any liability related to any infringement claims subject to indemnification. As such, there have been no amounts accrued for infringement claims as of September30, 2005 or
September 30, 2004 in the consolidated balance sheets.  11Geographic and Segment Information  The Company has determined that it operates in a single reportable operating segment: the development and sale of services to measure, test, assure and improve the quality of service of Web sites. While the Company
operates under one operating segment, management reviews revenue under two categoriesservice level management and customer experience management services in addition to subscription services and professional services revenue. Management
continues to allocate resources based on the one operating segment.  The Company markets its products primarily from its operations in the United States. International sales are primarily to customers in Europe. International sales were approximately 8%, 6% and 6% of total revenue for the years ended
September30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Companys foreign-owned assets are not significant.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  The Board of Directors and Stockholders Keynote Systems, Inc.:  We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Keynote Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September30, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss,
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September30, 2005. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Keynote
Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September30, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended September30, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.  We have
also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting of Keynote Systems Inc. as of September30, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated December6, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of, and an adverse opinion on the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.  /s/KPMG LLP  Mountain View, California December6, 2005

aManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and
15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  The Public Company Accounting Oversight Boards Auditing Standard
No2 defines a material weakness as a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in there being more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will
not be prevented or detected.  In conducting the evaluation of
the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2005, management identified a material weakness related to the accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the Company did not have resources
with adequate technical knowledge relating to accounting for deferred income taxes in order to prepare or review the income tax related amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements. This material weakness resulted in a material error in
the Companys consolidated financial statements related to the inappropriate recording of a reduction in the valuation allowance as a benefit for income taxes rather than as a reduction of goodwill. This error was corrected prior to the
Companys issuance of its 2005 consolidated financial statements.  As a result of this material weakness, management has concluded that, as of September30, 2005, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was not effective.  Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of September30, 2005 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.  bChanges in Internal Controls  Except as noted in this item, there were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  We are taking steps to ensure that the material weakness identified above is remediated by implementing enhanced control
processes over accounting for deferred income tax assets and liabilities, including the valuation allowance, which will include utilizing personnel from a third-party professional services firm with expertise in accounting for income taxes to assist
in the preparation and review of our income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities. The remediation will be included as part of our process of completing our financial close and generating our consolidated financial statements in the
first quarter of fiscal 2006.  cEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 require public companies to maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are defined to mean a companys controls and other procedures that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the 
81 Table of Contents
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commissions rules and forms.
Based upon the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting referenced above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in reaching a level
of reasonable assurance in achieving our desired control objectives. Management of the Company is in the process of implementing measures to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.  dLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to
their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of
two or more people, or by management override of the controls.  The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  The Board of Directors and Stockholders Keynote Systems, Inc.:  We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Item
9Aa, that Keynote Systems, Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2005, because of the effect of a material weakness identified in managements assessment, based on criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Keynote Systems, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material
misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. A material weakness related to accounting for income taxes has been identified and included in managements assessment as of September30, 2005.
Specifically, the Company did not have resources with adequate technical knowledge related to accounting for deferred income taxes in order to prepare or review the income tax related amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements. This
material weakness resulted in a material error in the Companys consolidated financial statements related to the inappropriate recording of a reduction in the valuation allowance as a benefit for income taxes rather than as a reduction of
goodwill.  We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Keynote Systems Inc. and subsidiaries as of September30, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
