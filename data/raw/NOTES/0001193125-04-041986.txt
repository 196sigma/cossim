30  PART II  Item 5.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Securities Exchange Act 1934 Rules 13a-14c and 15d-14c
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms, and
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the
disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  Within 90 days prior to the date of this annual report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the
Companys management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  There have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect the internal controls subsequent to the date we completed our evaluation. There were no significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses, and therefore no corrective actions were taken.
