ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Core Molding Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Columbus, Ohio
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Core
Molding Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31,
2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the consolidated financial
statement schedules listed in the Index at . These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and consolidated financial statement schedules based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Core Molding Technologies, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein. s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries after elimination of all
material intercompany accounts, transactions and profits. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
REVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue from product sales is recognized at the time
products are shipped and title transfers. Allowances for returned products and
other credits are estimated and recorded as revenue is recognized. Tooling
revenue is recognized when the customer approves the tool and accepts ownership.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - The Company considers all highly liquid
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. Cash is held primarily in one bank.
INVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in,
first-out or market. The Company had recorded an allowance for slow moving and
obsolete inventory of $670,000 at December 31, 2004 and $325,000 at December 31,
2003.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - Property, plant and equipment are recorded
at cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. The carrying amount of long-lived assets is
evaluated annually to determine if adjustment to the depreciation period or to
the unamortized balance is warranted.
Ranges of estimated useful lives for computing depreciation are as
follows    Land improvements                    20 years
Building and improvements                20-40 years
Machinery and equipment                 3-15 years
Tools, dies and patterns                3-5 years
Depreciation expense was $2,041,000, $2,153,000 and $1,983,000 for 2004,
2003, and 2002. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately $0, $33,000 and $0 of
interest costs were capitalized in property, plant and equipment.
DEFERRED GAIN - Deferred gains resulted from sales leaseback transactions
that occurred in 1997 and 1998 and are being amortized over the lease period.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS - Long-lived assets consist primarily of property and
equipment, goodwill and a customer list. The recoverability of long-lived assets
is evaluated by an analysis of operating results and consideration of other
significant events or changes in the business environment. The Company evaluates
whether impairment exists for property and equipment and the customer list on
the basis of undiscounted expected future cash flows from operations before
interest. For goodwill, the Company evaluates whether impairment exists on the
basis of estimated fair value of the associated reporting unit. If impairment
exists, the carrying amount of the long-lived assets is reduced to its estimated
fair value, less any costs associated with the final settlement. For the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, there was no impairment of the Company
long-lived assets.
SELF-INSURANCE - The Company is self-insured with respect to most of its
medical and dental claims and workers' compensation claims. The Company has
recorded an estimated liability for self-insured medical and dental claims
incurred but not reported and worker compensation claims incurred but not
reported at December 31, 2004, and 2003 of $931,000 and $860,000, respectively.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - The Company financial instruments
consist of a mortgage backed security investment, long term debt, an interest
rate swap, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The carrying amount of
these financial instruments approximated their fair value.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK - The Company has significant transactions
with four major customers see Note 3, which together comprised 86%, 91% and
87% of total sales in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively and 85% and 82% of the
accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial
condition. The Company maintains reserves for potential bad debt losses, and
such bad debt losses have been historically within the Company expectations.
Export sales, including sales to Canada and Mexico, for products provided to
certain customers' manufacturing and service locations totaled 16%, 18% and 24%
of total sales for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE - Basic earnings per common share is computed
based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per common share are computed similarly but include the
effect of the assumed exercise of dilutive stock options under the treasury
stock method.
The computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share is as
follows                               YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

STOCK BASED COMPENSATION - The Company accounts for its stock option plans
in accordance with Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, under
which no compensation cost has been recognized. Had compensation cost for all
stock option plans been determined consistent with the fair value method
prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, the Company net income and earnings

OTHER INCOME - Effective September 3, 2002, the Company changed its ticker
symbol on the American Stock Exchange from CME to CMT. This change took
place because another corporation purchased the rights to use CME from the
Company for $500,000, which is included in other income in the consolidated
statements of operations.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - Research and Development costs, which are
expensed as incurred, totaled approximately $383,000 in 2004, $251,000 in 2003
and $270,000 in 2002.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 151, Inventory Costs - an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, which
clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs, and wasted material spoilage and also requires that the
allocation of fixed production overhead be based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred
during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of adopting this statement but believes it will not have a
material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
In December 2004, the FASB issued revised SFAS No. 123, Share-Based
Payment which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
This statement, which requires the cost of all share-based payment transactions
be recognized in the financial statements, establishes fair value as the
measurement objective and requires entities to apply a fair-value-based
measurement method in accounting for share-based payment transactions. The
statement applies to all awards granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled
after July 1, 2005, and unvested portions of previously issued and outstanding
awards. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this
statement.
FOREIGN CURRENCY ADJUSTMENTS - In conjunction with the Company
acquisition of certain assets of Airshield Corporation, the Company established
operations in Mexico. The functional currency for the Mexican operations is the
United States dollar. All foreign currency asset and liability amounts are
remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Income
statement accounts are translated at the monthly average rates. Gains and losses
resulting from translation of foreign currency financial statements into United
States dollars and gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions
are included in current results of operations. Aggregate foreign currency
translation and transaction gains losses included in operations totaled
$148,782 in 2004, $119,930 in 2003 and $48,622 in 2002.

4. ACQUISITION OF KEYSTONE RESTYLING
In September 2004, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets
consisting primarily of inventory and equipment, of Keystone Restyling Products,
Inc. for $544,150. The Company may be required to pay contingent cash payments
based on certain earnings threshold of the acquired business during the
three-year period beginning January 1, 2005, and continuing through December 31,
2007. Such additional costs will be recorded as an intangible asset.
The acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting.
Accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to tangible and identified
intangible assets acquired based on a preliminary estimate of the fair values at
the date of acquisition. If the acquisition had occurred at January 1, 2004, the
operating results of Keystone Restyling Products, Inc. would not have been
significant to the Company.
The following table presents the allocation of the purchase price            
Inventory        $145,110
Property and equipment  151,450
Customer list       247,590
Total purchase price   $544,150
The Company will amortize the customer list on a straight-line basis over
sixty months. Amortization expense was $12,380 in 2004 and is expected to be
$49,518 in 2005 through 2008 and $37,138 in 2009.

Expenses are incurred in the United States dollar and the Mexican peso. Expenses
incurred in pesos include labor, utilities, supplies and materials, and amounted
to approximately 30% of sales in 2004, 32% of sales in 2003 and 39% of sales in
2002. The Company owns long-lived assets that are geographically located at the
Mexican operation, which total $466,000 at December 31, 2004. The Company
manufacturing operation in Mexico is subject to various political, economic, and
other risks and uncertainties inherent to Mexico. Among other risks, the
Company Mexican operations are subject to domestic and international customs
and tariffs, changing taxation policies and governmental regulations.

NOTE PAYABLE - BANK
On December 30, 2003, the Company borrowed $9,000,000 in the form of a
note payable collateralized by the Company assets. The note payable bears
interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis points or the prime rate and
this rate was 428% at December 31, 2004.
INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BOND
In May 1998, the Company borrowed $7,500,000 through the issuance of an
Industrial Revenue Bond IRB. The IRB bears interest at a weekly adjustable
rate and matures in April 2013. The maximum interest rate that may be charged at
any time over the life of the IRB is 10%.
As security for the IRB, the Company obtained a letter of credit from a
commercial bank, which has a balance of $5,444,000 as of December 31, 2004. The
letter of credit can only be used to pay principal and interest on the IRB. Any
borrowings made under the letter of credit bear interest at the bank prime
rate and are secured by a lien and security interest in all of the Company
assets. The letter of credit expires in April 2010, and the Company intends to
extend the letter of credit each year as required by the IRB.
NOTE PAYABLE - INTERNATIONAL
In 2003 the Company paid the note payable due International in two
payments. The first payment in the amount of $1,861,000 occurred in the first
quarter of 2003, and a second payment of $17,859,000 was made on December 30,
2003. For the second payment, the Company borrowed $9,000,000 in the form of a
note payable from its primary bank and used its cash reserves. The remaining
balance of the International note of $200,000 was replaced by a new, 8% note due
December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, this note was recorded as being
forgiven due to the performance objectives being achieved and the amount was
recorded in Paid In Capital because International is a significant shareholder
of the Company see Note 12.

LINE OF CREDIT
At December 31, 2004, the Company had available a $7,500,000 variable rate
bank revolving line of credit scheduled to mature on April 30, 2007. The line of
credit bears interest at LIBOR plus two percent or at the prime rate. The line
of credit is collateralized by all the Company assets. There was no
outstanding balance on the bank revolving line of credit at December 31, 2004
and 2003.
INTEREST RATE SWAPS
In conjunction with its variable rate Industrial Revenue Bond, the Company
entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which is designated as a cash flow
hedging instrument. Under this agreement, the Company pays a fixed rate of 489%
to the bank and receives 76% of the 30-day commercial paper rate. The swap term
and notional amount matches the payment schedule on the IRB with final maturity
in April 2013. The difference paid or received varies as short-term interest
rates change and is accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense.
While the Company is exposed to credit loss on its interest rate swap in the
event of non-performance by the counterparty to the swap, management believes
such non-performance is unlikely to occur given the financial resources of the
counterparty. The effectiveness of the swap is assessed at each financial
reporting date by comparing the commercial paper rate of the swap to the
benchmark rate underlying the variable rate of the Industrial Revenue Bond.
Effective January 1, 2004, the Company entered into an interest rate swap
agreement, which is designated as a cash flow hedge of the bank note payable.
Under this agreement, the Company pays a fixed rate of 575% to the bank and
receives LIBOR plus 200 basis points. The swap term and notional amount matches
the payment schedule on the secured note payable with final maturity in January
2011. While the Company is exposed to credit loss on its interest rate swap in
the event of non-performance by the counterparty to the swap, management
believes such non-performance is unlikely to occur given the financial resources
of the counterparty. Interest expense includes $409,000 in 2004, $235,000 in
2003 and $225,000 in 2002 of settlements related to the swaps.
BANK COVENANTS
The Company is subject to formal debt covenants related to minimum fixed
charge coverage and total funded obligations debt ratios. As of December 31,
2004, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

8.  EQUITY
ANTI-TAKEOVER MEASURES
The Company Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws contain
certain provisions designed to discourage specific types of transactions
involving an actual or threatened change of control of the Company. These
provisions, which are designed to make it more difficult to change majority
control of the Board of Directors without its consent, include provisions
related to removal of Directors, the approval of a merger and certain other
transactions as outlined in the Certificate of Incorporation and any amendments
to those provisions.
RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER
The Company Certificate of Incorporation contains a provision the
Prohibited Transfer Provision designed to help assure the continued
availability of the Company substantial net operating loss and capital loss
carryforwards see Note 10 by seeking to prevent an ownership change as
defined under current Treasury Department income tax regulations. Under the
Prohibited Transfer Provision, if a stockholder transfers or agrees to transfer
stock, the transfer will be prohibited and void to the extent that it would
cause the transferee to hold a Prohibited Ownership Percentage as defined in
the Company Certificate of Incorporation, but generally, means direct and
indirect ownership of 45% or more of the Company common stock or if the
transfer would result in the transferee ownership increasing if the transferee
had held a Prohibited Ownership Percentage within the three prior years or if
the transferee ownership percentage already exceeds the Prohibited Ownership
Percentage under applicable Federal income tax rules. The Prohibited Transfer
Provision does not prevent transfers of stock between persons who do not hold a
Prohibited Ownership Percentage.

9.  INCENTIVE STOCK PLANS
STOCK OPTIONS
The Company has a Long Term Equity Incentive Plan the Plan, as
originally approved by the shareholders in May 1997, and as amended in May 2000
to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance, that allows for grants
to directors and key employees of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock
options, director options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
performance shares, performance units and other incentive awards up to an
aggregate of 30 million awards, each representing a right to buy a share of the
Company common stock. The Plan expires on the earlier of December 31, 2006, or
the date the maximum number of available awards under the plan have been
granted.
During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company granted stock options under
the plan. The options have vesting schedules of five or nine and one-half years
from the date of grant, are not exercisable after ten years from the date of
grant, and were granted at prices which equaled or exceeded the fair market
value of the Company common stock at the date of grant.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2004, 2003
and 2002 was $156, $212 and $117, respectively. The fair value of the options
granted were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions: risk free interest rate of
413% for 2004, 414% for 2003 and 397% for 2002, no expected dividend yield,
expected lives of 8 to 10 years and expected volatility of 37%, 56% and 73% for
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
On August 4, 2003, of the 1,171,500 stock options outstanding,
978,000 options were tendered for cancellation. The Company issued 594,700
options under the Plan on February 9, 2004, at $321 per share. On the same
date, the Company issued 261,250 options that were not covered under the Plan at

11. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Company provides postretirement benefits to substantially all of its
United States employees. Costs associated with postretirement benefits include
pension expense, postretirement health care and life insurance expense and
expense related to contributions to two 401k defined contribution plans. In
addition, all of the Company United States union employees are covered under a
multi-employer defined benefit pension plan administered under a collective
bargaining agreement. The Company does not administer this plan and
contributions are determined in accordance with provisions in the negotiated
labor contract.
Prior to the acquisition of Columbus Plastics from International, certain
of the Company employees were participants in various International sponsored
pension and postretirement plans. The International pension plan for
non-represented employees was non-contributory and both benefits and years of
service were frozen as of the date of the acquisition of Columbus Plastics. In
connection with the acquisition, International retained responsibility for the
vested benefits as of December 31, 1996, and the Company agreed to reimburse
International for early retirement subsidies for certain employees. The
accumulated benefit obligation, which equals the projected benefit obligation
and net liability, is $248,000 at December 31, 2004 and $233,000 at December 31,
2003.
The postretirement health and life insurance plan provides healthcare and
life insurance for certain employees upon their retirement, along with their
spouses and certain dependents and requires cost sharing between the Company,
International and the participants in the form of premiums, co-payments and
deductibles. The Company and International share the cost of benefits for
certain employees, using a formula that allocates the cost based upon the
respective portion of time that the employee was an active service participant
after the acquisition of Columbus Plastics to the period of active service prior
to the acquisition of Columbus Plastics.
The funded status of the Company postretirement health and life
insurance benefits plan as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and reconciliation with
the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets are provided below                                POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS
