We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of NitroMed,Inc. as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the related statements of operations, redeemable convertible
preferred stock and stockholders' equity deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2003. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NitroMed,Inc. at December31, 2003 and 2002,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United

NITROMED,INC.      NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts    
1. The Company 
NitroMed,Inc. the Company is an emerging pharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and seeks to commercialize pharmaceuticals based on the
therapeutic benefits of the naturally-occurring molecule nitric oxide. The Company utilizes its nitric oxide expertise and proprietary technology in an effort to both develop novel pharmaceuticals and
improve the safety and efficacy of widely-prescribed drugs. The Company research and development efforts focus on major diseases that are characterized by a deficiency in nitric oxide, such as
cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Concentrations of Credit Risk 
The financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk primarily consist of cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities. The majority of the Company cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are maintained with well-known, established financial institutions. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition. Investments with
maturities in excess of three months at the time of acquisition are classified as marketable securities and designated as available-for-sale. Cash equivalents consist of
institutional money market funds, and marketable securities consist of corporate bonds with contractual maturities of less than two years. Available-for-sale securities are
carried at fair market value, which approximates amortized cost, as reported by the custodian, and unrealized gains and losses, if any, are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive
income within stockholders' equity deficit. Realized gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses were not material for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Financial instruments mainly consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and long-term obligations. The carrying
amounts of these instruments approximate their fair values. 
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range between
three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized based upon the lesser of the term of the lease or the useful life of the asset. The Company 
51  reviews
its property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of certain assets may not be recoverable and recognizes an impairment loss when it is
probable that the estimated cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset. Research and Development Expenses 
Research and development costs primarily consist of salaries and related expenses for personnel, fees paid to consultants and outside service providers and
materials used in clinical trials and research and development. The Company charges research and development expenses, including costs associated with acquiring patents, to operations as incurred. 
The
Company enters into contracts with professional service providers to conduct clinical trials and related services. These professional service providers render services over an
extended period of time, generally one to three years. Typically, the Company enters into two types of vendor contracts, patient-based or time-based. Under a patient-based contract, the
Company first determines an appropriate per patient cost using critical factors contained within the contract, which include the estimated number of patients, the cost assigned to each patient based
on a patient number of visits and the total dollar value of the contract. The Company then records expense based upon the total number of patients enrolled during the period and the status of each
patient. Under a time based contract, using critical factors contained within the contract such as the stated duration of the contract and the timing of services provided, the Company records the
contractual expense for each service provided ratably over the period during which the Company estimates the service will be performed. On a monthly basis, the Company reviews both the timetable of
services to be rendered and the timing of services actually received based on regular communications with its vendors in order to gauge the reasonableness of its estimates. Based upon this review,
revisions may be made to the forecasted timetable or the extent of services performed, or both, in order to reflect the Company most current estimate of the contract. 
Revenue Recognition 
Revenue is deemed earned when all of the following have occurred: all obligations of the Company relating to the revenue have been met and the earnings process is
complete; the monies received or receivable are not refundable irrespective of research results; and there are neither future obligations or milestones to be met by the Company with respect to such
revenue. The Company recognizes revenue from nonrefundable, up-front licenses and related payments, not specifically tied to a separate earnings process, ratably over the period that the
Company is obligated to participate on a continuing and substantial basis in the research and development activities outlined in each contract. When payments are specifically tied to a separate
earnings process, revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation associated with the payment has been satisfied. Performance obligations typically consist of contracted services or
development milestones. Revenue from services performed under collaborative research agreements is recognized as reimbursable costs are incurred. Revenue from significant milestones in the development
lifecycle of the related technology, including initiation of clinical trials or filing for and obtaining approvals with regulatory agencies are considered earned when the payor acknowledges the
milestone achievement, which is generally by payment of amounts due. 
52  Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company has elected to account for its stock-based compensation plans under the intrinsic value method pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, and related Interpretations, rather than the alternative fair value accounting
provided under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation FAS123. In accordance with
EITF 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other than Employees for Acquiring, or in Connection with Selling Goods or
Services EITF96-18, the Company records compensation expense equal to the fair value of the option granted to non-employees over the vesting
period, which is generally the period of service. 
FAS123
requires pro forma information regarding net loss and net loss per share as if the Company had accounted for its stock-based awards to employees under the fair value
method of FAS123. The fair value of the Company stock options used to compute pro forma net loss is the estimated fair value at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following weighted-average assumptions: December 31 2003
2002
2001 Risk-free interest rate
28 35 45 Expected volatility
80 80 80 Expected lives
4 years
4 years
4 years Expected dividend The
per-share, weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $649, $328 and $129,
respectively. 
For
purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized over the option vesting period. Had compensation expense for the Company stock-based
compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans 
53  consistent
with the method of FAS123, the Company net loss and net loss per share would have been as follows: Years Ended December 31 2003
2002
2001 Net loss attributable to common stockholders as reported 30,920 20,039 13,291 Add: Stock-based employee compensation expense included in reported net loss 722 522 310 Deduct: Stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method 850 319 213 FAS 123 Pro forma net loss 31,048 19,836 13,194 Basic and diluted net loss per share As reported 695 2066 1791 FAS 123 Pro forma 698 2045 1778 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income 
The Company presents comprehensive loss in accordance with SFAS130, Reporting Comprehensive Income.
Accumulated other comprehensive income is comprised entirely of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. 
Income Taxes 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as
net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization. 
Net Loss Per Share 
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and the dilutive potential
common stock equivalents then outstanding. Potential common stock equivalents consist of stock options, warrants and redeemable convertible preferred stock. Since the Company has a net loss for all
periods presented, the effect of all potentially dilutive securities is antidilutive. Accordingly, basic and diluted net loss per share is the same. 
54  Segment Information 
During the three years ended December31, 2003, the Company operated in one reportable business segment, developing nitric oxide enhancing medicines, under
the management approach of SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.
New Accounting Standards 
In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities FIN 46, which was amended by FIN 46R issued in December 2003. This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated
Financial Statements, addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities VIEs that either: 1 do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to
permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or 2 for which the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial
interest. This Interpretation applies immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003. It also applies in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after March 15, 2004, to VIEs created before
February 1, 2003 in which an enterprise holds a variable interest. FIN 46 requires disclosure of VIEs in financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, if it is reasonably possible that as of the
transition date: 1 the Company will be the primary beneficiary of an existing VIE that will require consolidation or, 2 the Company will hold a significant variable interest in, or have
significant involvement with, an existing VIE. The Company is currently in the process of completing its review of the requirements of FIN 46. However, the Company has not yet identified any entities
that require disclosure or entities that would require consolidation under FIN 46 that had not previously been consolidated as a result of FIN 46. 
In
November2003, during discussion on EITF Issue No03-01, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and
Its Application to Certain Investments, the EITF reached a consensus which requires certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures for debt and marketable equity securities
classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity under SFAS115 and SFAS124 that are impaired at the balance sheet date but for which
an other-than-temporary impairment has not been recognized. The consensus on quantitative and qualitative disclosures is effective for fiscal years ending after
December15, 2003 and comparative information for earlier periods presented is not required. The Company currently does not have any impaired investments and thus the adoption of this consensus
did not have a material impact on its financial statements. 
In
December2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No104, Revenue Recognition, SAB104 which supercedes
SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 104 primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in SAB 101 related to
multiple element revenue arrangements and to rescind the SEC Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements Frequently Asked Questions and Answers
FAQ issued with SAB 101. Selected portions of the FAQ have been incorporated into SAB 104. The adoption of SAB 104 did not have a material impact on the Company revenue recognition policies.

Note Receivable from Stock Purchase Agreement 
On December31, 1997, the Company executed a $252,000 loan to an officer that was used to purchase 350,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Company
at a purchase price of $072 per share. These shares were granted under the Company 1993 Equity Incentive Plan. The loan was due and payable in full in September2002, bore interest at a rate
of 602% per annum which interest was forgiven and was secured, pursuant to the terms of a Pledge Agreement, by the restricted shares. Twenty percent of the shares vested at the date of issuance and
an additional 20% of the shares vested annually each September. Based on the terms of the arrangement, the award was required to be accounted for as variable compensation. Accordingly, the Company
recorded noncash stock 
56  compensation
charges for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001 of $392,000 and $253,000, respectively. In addition, during September2002, the Company forgave the loan and recorded
an additional noncash compensation charge of $252,000 for the year ended December31, 2002.

SeriesE and F 
On August1, 2003, the Company completed the sale of 2,776,347 shares of SeriesE redeemable convertible preferred stock for net proceeds of
$199million. These shares automatically converted to common stock upon the closing of the Company initial public offering of common stock on November10, 2003. These shares contained
a beneficial conversion feature based on the fair value of the common stock into which the shares were convertible. In accordance with EITF 98-5, Accounting for
Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios, the value of such beneficial conversion feature of approximately
$83million has been recognized as a deemed dividend in the three month period ended September30, 2003. 
The
SeriesF conversion ratio provided for additional shares of common stock when the Company issued equity securities, as defined, for consideration of less than $14 per share,
the purchase price of SeriesF. As a result of the above sale of these SeriesE shares, the SeriesF conversion ratio was increased from 1:1 to 1:1073364. The adjustment to the
SeriesF conversion ratio is a beneficial conversion feature. In accordance with EITF 00-27, Application of Issue 98-5 to Certain Convertible
Instruments, the value of such beneficial conversion feature of approximately $37,000 has been recognized as a deemed dividend in the three month period ended
September30, 2003. 
Subsequent
to the August2003 sale of the SeriesE shares, the SeriesE stockholders and the Company agreed to increase the SeriesE conversion ratio from 1:1
to 1:11526 in consideration of the SeriesE stockholders waiving their rights to certain anti-dilution provisions. The adjustment to the conversion ratio, which was contingent on
the initial public offering, is a beneficial conversion feature. In accordance with EITF 00-27, the value of the SeriesE beneficial conversion feature of approximately
$110million has been recognized as a deemed dividend in the period of issuance, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2003 as a result of the initial public offering. In addition, the
conversion of the SeriesE shares in the initial public offering caused the accrued but unpaid SeriesE dividends of approximately $64million to become payable through the
issuance of 513,033 shares of common stock at the time of the initial public offering.

its technology to Johnson Johnson and affiliates in return for initial license fees, reimbursement of qualified research expenditures and the purchase of $30million of
SeriesB. The agreements contained provisions for future payments to the
Company upon the achievement of certain research and development milestones and future royalties to the Company on sales of products developed under the agreements. One of the agreements with
affiliates of Johnson Johnson was terminated in April2000 and the other agreement was terminated in September2001.

process of BiDil. The agreement provides for payment of legal consulting fees if and when the Company receives written FDA approval of BiDil. At December31, 2003, the Company estimates the
potential payment to be approximately $1,097,000 for services incurred to date, which will be accrued when FDA approval becomes probable. In addition, the agreement requires the Company to pay
royalties on sales of BiDil product. The royalty term ends six months from the date of market introduction of an FDA approved generic version of the BiDil product. 
An
academic institution has asserted that patents and patent applications which relate to the nitric oxide stent program may require a license from such institution. It is the opinion of
the Company management and legal counsel that the disputed intellectual property has been validly licensed to, or is validly owned by, the Company. Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements
do not include any provision related to this claim. 14. Retirement Plan
