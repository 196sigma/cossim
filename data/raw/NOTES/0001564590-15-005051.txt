NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies
Description of BusinessNetApp, Inc. we, us, or the Company provide software, systems and services to manage and store computer data. We enable enterprises, service providers, governmental organizations, and original equipment manufacturers to envision, deploy and evolve their information technology environments and to reduce costs and risk while driving growth and success for their organizations.
Fiscal Year Our fiscal year is reported on a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the last Friday in April. Our fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 ended on April 24, 2015, April 25, 2014 and April 26, 2013, respectively, and were each 52-week years. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every sixyears to realign fiscal months with calendar months. Fiscal year 2016 will span 53 weeks, with a 14th week included in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Companys fiscal years ended on the last Friday of April and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Accounting Change In our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we adopted an Accounting Standards Update ASU that simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring them to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, rather than as a deferred charge, consistent with debt discounts. The new guidance was applied on a retrospective basis to April 25, 2014. The amended presentation of debt issuance costs resulted in a $75 million and $54 million reduction of each of other non-current assets and long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets as of April 24, 2015 and April 25, 2014, respectively.
Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, reserves and allowances; inventory valuation and purchase order accruals; valuation of goodwill and intangibles; restructuring reserves; product warranties; employee benefit accruals; stock-based compensation; loss contingencies; investment impairments; income taxes and fair value measurements. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Available-for-Sale Investments We classify our investments in debt securities as available-for-sale investments. Debt securities primarily consist of corporate bonds, U.S. Treasury and government debt securities and certificates of deposit. These available-for-sale investments are primarily held in the custody of a major financial institution. A specific identification method is used to determine the cost basis of debt securities sold. These investments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
Unrealized gains and temporary losses, net of related taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss AOCI. Upon realization, those amounts are reclassified from AOCI to earnings. The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments are included in our results of operations. Realized gains and losses on our available-for-sale investments are calculated based on the specific identification method.
We classify our investments as current or noncurrent based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.
Other-than-Temporary Impairments on Investments All of our available-for-sale investments are subject to periodic impairment review. When the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, it is deemed impaired, and we assess whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. An impairment is considered other-than-temporary if iwe have the intent to sell the security, iiit is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis, or iiiwe do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If impairment is considered other-than-temporary based on condition ior iidescribed above, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the debt security is recognized in the results of operations. If an impairment is considered other-than-temporary based on condition iii described above, the amount representing credit losses defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security is recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income OCI.
55 For our auction rate securities ARSs, impairment was determined based on fair value and marketability of these investments. The valuation models used to estimate fair value include numerous assumptions such as assessments of the underlying structure of each security, expected cash flows, discount rates, trading activity in the secondary market for similar securities, credit ratings, workout periods, and overall capital market liquidity.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We write down excess and obsolete inventory based on the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand forecasts and market conditions. At the point of a loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established basis. In addition, we record a liability for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of excess and obsolete inventory.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost. 
Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method, generally over the following periods Depreciation Life Buildings and improvements 10 to 40 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years Computer, production, engineering and other equipment 2 to 3 years Computer software 3 to 5 years Leasehold improvements Shorter of remaining lease term or useful life Construction in progress will be depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets when they are ready for use. We capitalize interest on significant facility assets under construction and on significant software development projects.
Software Development Costs The costs for the development of new software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in accordance with the accounting guidance for software. Because our current process for developing software is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility, which occurs upon the completion of a working model, no costs have been capitalized for any of the periods presented.
Internal-Use Software Development Costs We capitalize qualifying costs, which are incurred during the application development stage, for computer software developed or obtained for internal-use and amortize them over the softwares estimated useful life.
Business Combinations We recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent that we identify adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.
Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets Goodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Purchased intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic lives of three to six years for developed technology, two to eight years for customer contracts/relationships, two to three years for covenants not to compete and two to seven years for trademarks and trade names as we believe this method most closely reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets will be consumed.
The carrying value of goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. Triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends, restructuring actions, lower projections of profitability, or a sustained decline in our market capitalization. The performance of the test involves a two-step process. The first step requires comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to its net book value, including goodwill. We have three reporting units, the fair values of which are determined based on an allocation of our entity level market capitalization, as determined through quoted market prices. A potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value. The second step of the process is only performed if a potential impairment exists, and it involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting units net assets other than goodwill and the fair value of the reporting unit. If that difference is less than the net book value of goodwill, an impairment exists and 
56 is recorded. We have not been required to perform this second step of the process because the fair values of each of our reporting units have exceeded their respective net book values in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review the carrying values of long-lived assets whenever events and circumstances, such as reductions in demand, lower projections of profitability, significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets, or significant negative industry or economic trends, indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition. If this review indicates that there is an impairment, the impaired asset is written down to its fair value, which is typically calculated using: iquoted market prices and/or iiexpected future cash flows utilizing a discount rate. Our estimates regarding future anticipated net revenue and cash flows, the remaining economic life of the products and technologies, or both, may differ from those used to assess the recoverability of assets. In that event, impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long-lived assets may be required, resulting in charges to our consolidated statements of operations when such determinations are made.
Derivative Instruments Our derivative instruments consist of foreign currency exchange contracts as described below:
Balance Sheet Hedges We utilize foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the short-term impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily intercompany receivables and payables. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments and do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because the gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset the gains and losses in the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged and the net amount is included in earnings.
Cash Flow HedgesWe use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange exposures related to forecasted sales transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges and in general, closely match the underlying forecasted transactions in duration. The contracts are carried in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and the effective portion of the contracts gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value is recorded in AOCI until the forecasted transaction is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. When the forecasted transactions occur, we reclassify the related gains or losses on the cash flow hedges into net revenues. If the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur, or it becomes probable that they will not occur within the defined hedge period, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from AOCI and recognized immediately in earnings. We measure the effectiveness of hedges of forecasted transactions on a monthly basis by comparing the fair values of the designated foreign currency exchange forward purchase contracts with the fair values of the forecasted transactions. Any ineffective portion of the derivative hedging gain or loss, as well as changes in the fair value of the derivatives time value which are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, are recognized in earnings.
Factors that could have an impact on the effectiveness of our hedging programs include the accuracy of forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets. These programs reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements. Currently, we do not enter into any foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures related to firm commitments or nonmarketable investments. Cash flows from our derivative programs are included under operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Customarily we have a purchase order and/or contract prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement from our end users, customers, value-added resellers or distributors. Delivery has occurred. Our product is physically delivered to our customers. We typically do not allow for restocking rights with any of our value-added resellers or distributors. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria are achieved. We do not recognize revenue if undelivered products or services exist that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an arrangement. The fee is fixed or determinable. Arrangements with payment terms extending beyond our standard terms, conditions and practices are not considered to be fixed or determinable. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized at the earlier of customer payment or when the fees become due and payable. We typically do not allow for price-protection rights with any of our value-added resellers or distributors. Collection is reasonably assured. If there is considerable doubt surrounding the creditworthiness of a customer at the outset of an arrangement, the associated revenue is deferred and recognized upon cash receipt.
The hardware systems and software components essential to the functionality of the hardware systems are considered non-software deliverables and therefore are not subject to industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance.
57 Our product revenues also include revenues from the sale of non-essential software products. Non-essential software sales generally include a perpetual license to our software. Non-essential software sales are subject to the industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance.
Our multiple element arrangements may include our systems, software maintenance, hardware maintenance and other services. Software maintenance contracts entitle our customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis, and patch releases. Hardware maintenance services include contracts for extended warranty, technical support and minimum response times. Other services include professional services and customer education and training services. Revenues from software maintenance and hardware maintenance services are recognized ratably over the contractual term, generally from one to five years. We also offer extended warranty contracts which extend our standard parts warranty and may include premium hardware maintenance at the end of the original warranty term; revenues from these contracts are recognized ratably over their respective contract term. We sell professional services either on a time and materials basis or under fixed price projects; we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed.
For multiple element arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software deliverables and the non-software deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: vendor specific objective evidence of selling price VSOE if available, third party evidence TPE if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price ESP if neither VSOE nor TPE are available. ESP is generally evidenced by a majority of historical transactions falling within a reasonable price range. We also consider multiple factors, including, but not limited to, cost of products, gross margin objectives, historical pricing practices, type of customer and distribution channels. For our non-software deliverables, we generally allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables using ESP. For our software maintenance services, we generally use VSOE. When we are unable to establish VSOE for our software maintenance services, we use ESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration.
VSOE is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately. VSOE is generally evidenced by a substantial majority of historical stand-alone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range. In addition, we consider major service type, customer type, and other variables in determining VSOE.
When VSOE cannot be established, we attempt to establish the selling price of each element based on third party evidence of selling price TPE. Generally, we are not able to determine TPE because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained.
We regularly review VSOE, TPE, and ESP and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates.
For our software deliverables, we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and VSOE of all undelivered elements exists. Typically, only software maintenance, hardware maintenance and/or other services remain undelivered after the product is delivered. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the consideration is recognized as product revenues for delivered elements. If evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist, all revenue is generally deferred until the earlier of when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established. In instances where the only undelivered element without fair value is software maintenance, the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the maintenance period.
We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment. Sales returns are estimated based on historical sales returns, current trends, and our expectations regarding future experience. We monitor and analyze the accuracy of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and adjust them for future expectations. Additionally, distributors and retail partners participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs, and we record estimated accruals and allowances for these programs. We accrue for these programs based on contractual terms and historical experience. Sales and value added taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Product Warranties Estimated future hardware and software warranty costs are recorded as a cost of product revenues at the time of product shipment, based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside our typical experience. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units subject to warranty protection, product failure rates, estimated material costs, estimated distribution costs and estimated labor costs. We assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual each quarter and adjust the amount as considered necessary. 
Foreign Currency Translation For international subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency, gains and losses resulting from translation of these foreign currency financial statements into U.S.dollars are recorded in AOCI. For subsidiaries where the functional currency is the U.S.dollar, gains and losses resulting from the process of remeasuring foreign currency financial statements into U.S.dollars are included in other income expense, net.
Benefit Plans We have a postretirement health care plan and various international defined benefit plans for certain of our employees. We record actuarial gains and losses within AOCI and amortize net gains or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of 
58 the market value of plan assets or the plans' projected benefit obligation on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated service life of plan participants. The measurement date for all defined benefit plans is our fiscal year end.
Stock-Based Compensation We measure and recognize stock-based compensation for all stock-based awards, including employee stock options, restricted stock units RSUs and rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan ESPP, based on their estimated fair value, and recognize the costs in our financial statements using the single option straight-line approach over the requisite service period for the entire award.
The fair value of employee RSUs is equal to the market value of our common stock on the grant date of the award, less the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period, discounted at a risk-free interest rate. Calculating the fair value of employee stock options and the rights to purchase shares under the ESPP requires estimates and significant judgment. The fair value of each award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and is not remeasured as a result of subsequent stock price fluctuations. Option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of awards and the stock price volatility of the underlying stock of such awards. Our expected term assumption is based primarily on historical exercise and post-vesting forfeiture experience. Effective fiscal 2013, our stock price volatility assumption is based on a combination of our historical and implied volatility, whereas prior to fiscal 2013, we solely used implied volatility. 
In addition, the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. The risk-free interest rates are based upon United States Treasury bills with equivalent expected terms, and the expected dividends are based on our history and expected dividend payouts.
We estimate the number of stock-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover. Our forfeiture assumption is primarily based on historical experience.
In the event of a modification of stock-based awards, if the requisite service period of the modified award is longer than the requisite service period of the original award and, both before and after the modification, it is probable that the awards will vest, we recognize the unrecognized compensation cost remaining from the original award plus the incremental compensation cost, if any, as a result of a modification in its entirety over the remaining portion of the requisite service period of the modified award.
Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are provided for temporary differences that will result in tax deductions or income in future periods, as well as the future benefit of tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance reduces tax assets to their estimated realizable value. Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
The accounting guidance for income taxes prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return including a decision whether to file or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction. We recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on the two-step process prescribed in the interpretation. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit. The second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority. Estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
Determining the liability for uncertain tax positions requires us to make significant estimates and judgments as to whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due based on potential tax audit issues in the U.S.and other tax jurisdictions throughout the world. Our estimates are based on the outcomes of previous audits, as well as the precedents set in cases in which others have taken similar tax positions to those taken by us. If we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations, we adjust the liability and effect a related change in our tax provision during the period in which we make such a determination.
Tax attributes related to the exercise of employee stock options are not realized until they result in a reduction of taxes payable. We do not include unrealized stock option attributes as components of our gross deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance disclosures.
Net Income per Share Basic net income per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share is computed giving effect to all dilutive potential shares that were outstanding during the period. Potential dilutive common shares can consist of outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under our employee stock purchase plan and unvested RSUs, as well as outstanding warrants and shares to be issued upon the conversion of convertible notes. 
59 Treasury Stock We account for treasury stock under the cost method. Upon the retirement of treasury stock, we allocate the value of treasury shares between common stock, additional paid-in capital and retained earnings.
2.Concentration of Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investments, foreign currency exchange contracts and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of corporate bonds, U.S.Treasury and government debt securities and certificates of deposit, all of which are considered high investment grade. Our policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities. We further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer.
By entering into foreign currency exchange contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The counterparties to these contracts are major multinational commercial banks, and we do not expect any losses as a result of counterparty defaults.
We sell our products primarily to large organizations in different industries and geographies. We do not require collateral or other security to support accounts receivable. In addition, we maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. To reduce credit risk, we perform ongoing credit evaluations on our customers financial condition. We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers, historical trends and other information and, to date, such losses have been within managements expectations. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the wide variety of customers who are dispersed across many geographic regions.
There are no concentrations of business transacted with a particular market that would severely impact our business in the near term. However, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain key components and a few key contract manufacturers to manufacture most of our products; any disruption or termination of these arrangements could materially adversely affect our operating results.
3.Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective
In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued an ASU that changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and expands related disclosure requirements. This accounting standard will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2016. The effects of this guidance will depend on the nature and significance of discontinued operations occurring after the effective date.
In May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance related to the recognition and reporting of revenue that establishes a comprehensive new revenue recognition model designed to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance allows for the use of either the full or modified retrospective transition method, and the standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018; early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements, as well as which transition method we intend to use.
In April 2015, the FASB issued an ASU to provide guidance to entities on evaluating the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement. This guidance will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2017 and may be applied prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date or retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU, as well as which transition method we intend to use, but do not anticipate material impacts on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 4.Statements of Cash Flows Additional Information

The accounting guidance for fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby the inputs used in valuation techniques are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the three levels of inputs to measure fair value:
Level1:Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level2:Inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in less active markets; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
64 Level3:Unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to measure fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.
We consider an active market to be one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, and consider an inactive market to be one in which there are infrequent or few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers. Where appropriate, our own or the counterpartys non-performance risk is considered in measuring the fair values of liabilities and assets, respectively.

Our Level 2 debt instruments are held by a custodian who prices some of the investments using standard inputs in various asset price models or obtains investment prices from third-party pricing providers that incorporate standard inputs in various asset price models. These pricing providers utilize the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or, if specific prices are not available for these securities, use other observable inputs like market transactions involving identical or comparable securities. We review Level 2 inputs and fair value for reasonableness and the values may be further validated by comparison to multiple independent pricing sources. In addition, we review third-party pricing provider models, key inputs and assumptions and understand the pricing processes at our third-party providers in determining the overall reasonableness of the fair value of our Level 2 financial instruments. As of April 24, 2015 and April25, 2014, we have not made any adjustments to the prices obtained from our third-party pricing providers.

We estimated the fair value of each individual ARS using an income discounted cash flow and market approach that incorporated both observable and unobservable inputs. Key inputs into the discounted cash flow analysis included the time-to-economic maturity, illiquidity premium, which factors in liquidity risk, market credit spread and other factors, and a coupon rate. The key input into the market approach is a discount rate. We reviewed the fair value of our Level 3 financial instruments for overall reasonableness by reviewing service provider pricing methodologies, key inputs and assumptions and by understanding the processes used by our third-party service provider.

Senior Notes
On June5, 2014 we issued $5000 million aggregate par value of 3375% Senior Notes, with a maturity date of June15, 2021, and received proceeds of approximately $4947 million, net of discount and issuance costs, which will be used for general corporate 
67 purposes, including possible stock repurchases, dividends, capital expenditures, working capital and potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. Our 200% Senior Notes and 325% Senior Notes, with a par value of $7500 million and $2500 million, respectively, were issued in December 2012. We collectively refer to such long-term debt as our Senior Notes. Interest on our Senior Notes is paid semi-annually on June15 and December15. Our Senior Notes, which are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations, rank equally in right of payment with any future senior unsecured indebtedness.
We may redeem the Senior Notes in whole or in part, at any time at our option at specified redemption prices. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events, we may be required to repurchase the Senior Notes under specified terms. The Senior Notes also include covenants that limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens on assets or on shares of stock or indebtedness of our subsidiaries; to engage in sale and lease-back transactions; and to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. As of April 24, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the Senior Notes.
As of April 24, 2015, our aggregate future principal debt maturities for our Senior Notes are as follows in millions Fiscal Year Amount 2018 7500 Thereafter 7500 Total 1,5000 175%Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 settled in June 2013
On June10, 2008, we issued $1,2650million aggregate principal amount of 175% Convertible Senior Notes the Convertible Notes that matured in June 2013. Upon maturity, the Convertible Notes were converted into shares of common stock at a conversion rate of 3140 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes which represented the effective conversion price of $3185 per share. Upon conversion in June 2013, the holders received cash for the principal amount of the Convertible Notes and an aggregate of 49 million shares of common stock for the $1789 million excess of the conversion value over the principal amount.
We separately accounted for the liability and equity components of the Convertible Notes. The initial debt component of the Convertible Notes was valued at $1,0170million based on the contractual cash flows discounted at an appropriate comparable market non-convertible debt borrowing rate at the date of issuance of 631%, with the equity component representing the residual amount of the proceeds of $2480million which was recorded as a debt discount. Issuance costs were allocated pro-rata based on the relative initial carrying amounts of the debt and equity components. As a result, $52million of the issuance costs was allocated to the equity component of the Convertible Notes, and $214million of the issuance costs remained classified as other non-current assets. The debt discount and the issuance costs allocated to the debt component were amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method.
The interest expense recognized on the Convertible Notes consisted of the following in millions Year Ended April25,

During fiscal 2014, concurrent with the repayment and conversion of the Convertible Notes, we exercised the Convertible Note hedges which were net settled for an aggregate of 39 million shares from the counterparties. We also entered into separate transactions in which we sold warrants to acquire 397 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $4128 per share. During fiscal 2014, 319 million warrants were exercised at a weighted-average price of $4309 and were net settled with 11 million shares of our common stock, equal to the difference between the market price on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the warrants on their respective exercise dates, and the remaining warrants expired unexercised.
Credit Facility
In December 2012, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicated group of lenders that is scheduled to expire on December 21, 2017 and provides for an unsecured $2500 million revolving credit facility that is comprised of revolving loans, Eurocurrency loans and/or swingline loans. The credit facility includes a $1000 million foreign currency sub-facility, a $500 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $100 million swingline sub-facility available on same-day notice. Available borrowings under the credit facility are reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings on the sub-facilities. We may also, subject to certain 
68 requirements, request an increase in the facility up toan additional $1000 million and request two additional one-year extensions, subject to certain conditions. The proceeds from the facility may be used by us for general corporate purposes.
Borrowings under the facility, except for swingline loans, accrue interest in arrears at an alternate base rate as defined in the credit agreement or, at our option, an adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus in each case, a spread based on our public debt ratings and the type of loan ranging from 02% to 12%. Swingline borrowings accrue interest at an alternate base rate. In addition, we are required to pay fees to maintain the credit facility, whether or not we have outstanding borrowings. The facility contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 30:10 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than 35:10. The facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens on assets or indebtedness of our subsidiaries and to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. As of April 24, 2015, no borrowings were outstanding under the facility and we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the facility.

Equity Incentive Programs
The 1999 Plan As most recently amended on September 5, 2014, the 1999 Stock Option Plan the Plan comprises five separate equity incentive programs: ithe Discretionary Option Grant Program under which options may be granted to eligible individuals at a fixed price per share; iithe Stock Appreciation Rights Program under which eligible persons may be granted stock appreciation rights that allow individuals to receive the appreciation in fair market value of the shares; iiithe Stock Issuance Program under which eligible individuals may be issued shares of common stock directly; ivthe Performance Share and Performance Unit Program also known as RSUs under which eligible persons may be granted performance shares or performance units which result in payment to the participant only if performance goals or other vesting criteria are achieved and vthe Automatic Award Program under which nonemployee board members automatically receive equity grants at designated intervals over their period of board service. The Plan expires in August 2019.
Under the Plan, the Board of Directors may grant to employees, nonemployee directors, consultants and independent advisors options to purchase shares of our common stock during their period of service. The exercise price for an incentive stock option and a nonstatutory option cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. Options granted under the Plan generally vest over a four-year period. Options granted generally have a term of sevenyears after the grant date, subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain events. The Plan prohibits the repricing of any outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right after it has been granted or to cancel any outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right and immediately replace it with a new stock option or stock appreciation right with a lower exercise price unless approved by stockholders. RSUs granted under the Plan generally vest over a four-year period with 25% vesting on each anniversary of the grant date. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has the discretion to use different vesting schedules.
Under the Plan, the number of shares reserved for issuance is reduced by two shares for every share subject to a full value award, which are specified to be grants that are in the form of performance shares and/or performance unit awards, stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units. The Plan i limits the number of shares that may be granted pursuant to awards under the Stock Issuance Program to a participant in any calendar year to 1 million, ii limits the initial value of performance units a participant may receive to not more than $5 million and iii limits the number of performance shares a participant may receive in a calendar year to 1 million.

Stock Repurchase Program
As of April 24, 2015, our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $96 billion of our common stock, including a $25 billion increase approved by our Board of Directors in fiscal 2015. Under this program, which we may suspend or discontinue at any time, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through open market and privately negotiated transactions at prices deemed appropriate by our management.
The following table summarizes activity related to this program in millions, except per share information Year Ended April 24,

Since the May 13, 2003 inception of our stock repurchase program through April 24, 2015, we repurchased a total of 2140 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $3348 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $72 billion.
Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreement
In fiscal 2014, we entered into a collared Accelerated Share Repurchase ASR with a third party under which we prepaid $7500 million to purchase shares of our common stock. The aggregate number of shares ultimately purchased was determined based on the volume weighted-average share price of our common stock over a specified period of time. This contract settled in fiscal 2014, resulting in the repurchase of 192 million shares, at an average price per share of $3913. The value of the ASR forward contract was determined to be $139 million, which was recorded as additional paid-in capital.
72 Preferred Stock
Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 50million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. No shares of preferred stock were issued or outstanding in any period presented.

We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency risk. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. We also have in place master netting arrangements to mitigate the credit risk of our counterparties and to potentially reduce our losses due to counterparty nonperformance. We present our derivative instruments as net amounts in our consolidated balance sheets. The gross and net fair value amounts of such instruments were not material as of April 24, 2015 or April 25, 2014. We did not recognize any gains and losses in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness for any period presented. All contracts have a maturity of less than six months.
Over the next 12 months, we expect an immaterial amount of derivative net gains recorded in AOCI as of April 24, 2015 will be reclassified into net revenues. The maximum length of time over which forecasted foreign currency denominated revenues are hedged is six months.

In May 2013, we initiated a business restructuring plan under which we realigned internal resources, resulting in a reduction of our global workforce of approximately 7%. Such activities were completed in the year ended April 25, 2014. In March 2014, we initiated a business realignment plan designed to focus our resources on key strategic initiatives and streamline our business in light of the constrained information technology spending environment, resulting in a reduction of our global workforce of approximately 4%. Such activities were completed in the year ended April 24, 2015. Restructuring and other charges consisted primarily of employee severance-related costs.
Activities related to these plans are summarized as follows in millions March 2014 Plan May 2013 Plan Total Balance as of April 26, 2013 Net charges 388 495 883 Cash payments 123 495 618 Balance as of April 25, 2014 265 265 Net charges Cash payments 265 265 Balance as of April 24, 2015 Liabilities for our restructuring plans were included in accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets. 74 14.Income Taxes

The increases are mainly attributable to corresponding changes in deferred tax assets, primarily foreign tax credit carryforwards in a foreign jurisdiction and state tax credit carryforwards in certain states.
As of April 24, 2015, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards were approximately $217million and $854 million, respectively, before applying tax rates for the respective jurisdictions. The federal and state tax credit carryforwards were approximately $1170million and $1455million, respectively. Certain acquired net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and credits will expire in various years from fiscal 2018 through 2035. If realized, $1220 million, tax effected, of net operating loss and tax credit carryovers will be recognized as additional paid-in capital.

Unrecognized tax benefits of $1675 million, including penalties, interest and indirect benefits, would affect our provision for income taxes if recognized.
We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. During fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized accrued interest and penalties of approximately $36 million, $22million and $12 million, respectively in the consolidated statements of operations and $86 million and $50 million, respectively, were recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of April 24, 2015 and April 25, 2014.
76 The tax years that remain subject to examination for our major tax jurisdictions are shown below:
Fiscal Years Subject to Examination for Major Tax Jurisdictions at April24, 2015 2008 2015 United States federal income tax 2008 2015 United States state and local income tax 2011 2015 Australia 2009 2015 Germany 2006 2015 India 2009 2015 Japan 2011 2015 The Netherlands 2013 2015 United Kingdom 2008 2015 Canada In addition, we are effectively subject to federal tax examination adjustments for tax years ended on or after fiscal 2001, in that we have net operating loss carryforwards from these years that could be subject to adjustment upon utilization. 
In July 2014, the Internal Revenue Service IRS completed the examination of our fiscal 2005 to 2007 income tax returns upon approval by the Joint Committee of Taxation. We recorded a $474 million income tax provision attributable to the audit settlement and related re-measurement of uncertain tax positions for tax years subject to future audits. The audit adjustments resulted in lower earnings in our foreign subsidiaries which reduced the taxability of dividends that were previously repatriated from such subsidiaries. Due to this reduction in taxable dividends, the conclusion of the fiscal 2005 to 2007 income tax audit resulted in a net refund of $80 million, excluding interest.
In October 2014, the United Kingdoms UKs tax authority concluded the examination of our fiscal 2009 to 2012 UK income tax returns. We recorded a $10 million income tax benefit for the net impact of the audit adjustments and related release of unrecognized tax benefits.
We are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the United States U.S. and several foreign tax jurisdictions. Transfer pricing calculations are key issues under audits in various jurisdictions, and are often subject to dispute and appeals. The IRS is currently auditing our fiscal 2008 to 2010 income tax returns. We expect the IRS examination team to complete their field audit within the next twelve months. However, the resolution of the fiscal 2008 to 2010 income tax return audits may likely occur beyond the next twelve months should we choose to appeal the IRS examination teams audit findings.
On September17, 2010, the Danish Tax Authorities issued a decision concluding that distributions declared in 2005 and 2006 from our Danish subsidiary were subject to Danish at-source dividend withholding tax. We do not believe that our Danish subsidiary is liable for withholding tax and filed an appeal with the Danish Tax Tribunal to that effect. On December19, 2011, the Danish Tax Tribunal issued a ruling that our Danish subsidiary was not liable for Danish withholding tax. The Danish tax examination agency appealed to the Danish High Court in March 2012. The Danish High Court hearing has not yet occurred.
We engage in continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in multiple jurisdictions. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude, certain statutes of limitations will lapse, or both. Given the uncertainties involved in all tax audits, we estimate a potential decrease in our unrecognized tax benefit balance of up to $954 million may occur within the next 12 months associated with the potential settlements and statute lapses.
As of April 24, 2015, the amount of accumulated unremitted earnings from our foreign subsidiaries is approximately $33 billion. We have not provided U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes previously paid on these earnings as well as tax attribute carryforwards. We estimate the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings to be approximately $1 billion as of April 24, 2015. 77 15.Net Income per Share

We operate in one industry segment: the design, manufacturing, marketing, and technical support of high-performance storage and data management solutions. We conduct business globally, and our sales and support activities are managed on a geographic basis. Our management reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by disaggregated information it receives from our internal management system about revenues by geographic region, based on the location from which the customer relationship is managed, for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. We do not allocate costs of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing, or general and administrative expenses to our geographic regions in this internal management reporting because management does not review operations or operating results, or make planning decisions, below the consolidated entity level.
Summarized revenues by geographic region based on information from our internal management system and utilized by our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered our Chief Operating Decision Maker, is as follows in millions Year Ended April 24,

Employee 401k Plan
Our 401k Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401k Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit. Effective January 1, 2015, we match 100% of the first 2% of eligible earnings an employee contributes to the 401k Plan, and then match 50% of the next 4% of eligible earnings an employee contributes. An employee receives the full 4% match when he/she contributes at least 6% of his/her eligible earnings, up to a maximum calendar year matching contribution of $6,000. Effective the same date, employer matching contributions made in the current and previous years vested immediately. Our employer matching contributions to the 401k Plan were as follows in millions Year Ended April 24,

Coverage continues through the duration of the lifetime of the retiree or the retirees spouse, whichever is longer. There is no funding requirement associated with the plan and none of the benefit obligation was funded as of April 24, 2015. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plan.
International Defined Benefit Plans
We maintain various defined benefit plans to provide termination and postretirement benefits to certain eligible employees outside of the U.S. We also provide disability benefits to certain eligible employees in the U.S. Eligibility is determined based on the terms of our plans and local statutory requirements. Assumed discount rates and expected long-term returns on plan assets have significant effects on the amounts reported for the defined benefit plans.

Future annual minimum lease payments under all non-cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year as of April 24, 2015 are as follows in millions 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter Total Operating lease commitments 619 440 296 210 173 317 2055 Rent expense under all cancellable and non-cancelable operating leases was $670 million, $655 million and $649 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
80 Purchase Orders and Other Commitments
In the ordinary course of business, we make commitments to third-party contract manufacturers, to manage manufacturer lead times and meet product forecasts, and to other parties, to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products. We establish accruals for estimated losses on non-cancellable purchase commitments for components to the extent we believe it is probable that such components will not be utilized in future operations. To the extent that such forecasts are not achieved, our commitments and associated accruals may change. As of April 24, 2015, we had $2950 million in non-cancelable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers. In addition, we recorded a liability for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts through a charge to cost of product revenues. As of April 24, 2015 and April 25, 2014, such liability amounted to $169 million and $115 million, respectively, and is included in accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets.
In addition to commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers, we have open purchase orders and construction related obligations associated with our ordinary course of business for which we have not received goods or services. As of April 24, 2015, we had $600 million in construction related obligations and $2110 million in other purchase obligations.
During the ordinary course of business, we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by us or our subsidiaries. As of April 24, 2015, our financial guarantees of $93million that were not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets consisted primarily of standby letters of credit and surety bonds.
Financing Guarantees
Some of our customers have entered into recourse and non-recourse financing leasing arrangements using third-party financing companies, and in some situations, we enter into customer financing arrangements for our products and services that are contemporaneously sold on a recourse or non-recourse basis to third-party financing companies. Under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of end-user customer default. These arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Under the terms of the non-recourse leases, we do not have any continuing obligations or liabilities to the third-party financing companies. Where we provide a guarantee for recourse leases, we defer revenues subject to the industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance, and recognize revenues for non-software deliverables in accordance with our multiple deliverable revenue arrangement policy. In connection with certain recourse financing arrangements, we receive advance payments associated with undelivered elements that are subject to customer refund rights. We defer revenue associated with these advance payments until the related refund rights expire and we perform the services. As of April 24, 2015 and April 25, 2014, the aggregate amount by which such contingencies exceeded the associated deferred revenue was not significant. To date, we have not experienced material losses under our lease financing programs or other financing arrangements.
Indemnification Agreements
We enter into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, we agree to defend and indemnify other parties, primarily our customers or business partners or subcontractors, for damages and reasonable costs incurred in any suit or claim brought against them alleging that our products sold to them infringe any U.S.patent, copyright, trade secret, or similar right. If a product becomes the subject of an infringement claim, we may, at our option: ireplace the product with another non-infringing product that provides substantially similar performance; iimodify the infringing product so that it no longer infringes but remains functionally equivalent; iiiobtain the right for the customer to continue using the product at our expense and for the reseller to continue selling the product; ivtake back the infringing product and refund to the customer the purchase price paid less depreciation amortized on a straight-line basis. We have not been required to make material payments pursuant to these provisions historically. We have not recorded any liability at April 24, 2015 related to these guarantees since the maximum amount of potential future payments under such guarantees, indemnities and warranties is not determinable, other than as described above.
Legal Contingencies
When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency.
We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business. No accrual has been recorded as of April 24, 2015 related to such matters as they are not probable and/or reasonably estimable. 81 Selected Quarterly Financial Data Unaudited

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NetApp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of April 24, 2015 and April 25, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 24, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

June 12, 2015 83 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
NetApp, Inc.
Sunnyvale, California
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of NetApp, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of April 24, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 24, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended April 24, 2015 of the Company and our report dated June 12, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

bManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
