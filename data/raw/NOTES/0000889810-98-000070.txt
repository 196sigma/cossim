Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA                 Page 24 of 54             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Mikasa, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mikasa, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1997. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Mikasa,
Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. COOPERS & LYBRAND L.L.P.

1. General Mikasa, Inc. Mikasa or the Company is a leading designer, developer and
marketer of quality tabletop products. The Company wide range of products
includes ceramic dinnerware, crystal stemware, stainless steel flatware, gifts
and decorative accessories for the home. The Company markets its products in the
United States and internationally to retail accounts, including department
stores, specialty retail stores and mass merchants, and through Company-owned
retail stores.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
2. Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Mikasa, Inc., holding company of American Commercial, Incorporated
and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries collectively the
Company. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.
CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS: Cash equivalents are highly liquid
investments with a maturity of ninety days or less when purchased. Short-term
investments consist of U.S. Government instruments with original maturities of
six months or less. These investments are classified as short-term investments
held-to-maturity. The carrying amounts for cash equivalents and short-term
investments approximate their fair values.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS: The excess of the purchase price over the fair market value
of the net assets acquired in the 1985 acquisition of the Common Stock of the
Company has been allocated to goodwill. Goodwill is amortized using the
straight-line method over its estimated useful life of 40 years.
Other intangible assets consist of loan costs to obtain financing and are
amortized over the terms of the related loans using the straight-line method.
The Company assesses whether there has been a permanent impairment in the value
of intangible assets by considering factors such as expected future operating
income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and
other economic factors. Management believes no permanent impairment has
occurred.
INVENTORIES: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT: Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the related assets as follows                 Page 30 of 54          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued                     Useful Life
Buildings           31 years
Building improvements     15 years
Furniture and fixtures     4-8 years
Leasehold improvements     Lesser of lease term or estimated useful
life of asset Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. The
cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization of property and
equipment sold or retired are removed from the accounts and resulting gains or
losses are included in income.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: During 1996, the Company implemented the disclosure
requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation. This statement sets forth alternative standards
of recognition of the cost of stock-based compensation and requires that a
Company financial statements include certain disclosures about stock-based
employee compensation arrangements regardless of the method used to account for
them. As allowed in this statement, the Company continues to apply Accounting
Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations in recording compensation related to its
plans. The supplemental disclosure requirements and further information related
to the Company stock option plans are presented in Note 13 to the Company
financial statements.
INCOME TAXES: The Company follows the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the
recognition of deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the expected
future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial
statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income tax liabilities
and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
REVENUES: Revenues are recognized upon shipment of product to customers. Sales
allowances, including cooperative advertising allowances, of $7,143,000 8,223,000 and $7,596,000 in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively, are accounted
for as a reduction of sales.
PRE-OPENING STORE EXPENSES: Pre-opening store expenses are charged to selling,
general and administrative expenses as incurred.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are
translated at year-end rates of exchange; income and expenses are translated at
the weighted average rates of exchange during the year. The resultant cumulative
translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders'
equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in net income
and were not significant in any period presented.                 Page 31 of 54          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued The Company periodically hedges against foreign currency exposures using forward
exchange contracts to cover identified inventory purchase commitments. Realized
and unrealized gains and losses are deferred and recognized as the related
transactions are settled. At December 31, 1997, approximately $3,000,000 of
forward exchange contracts hedging such commitments were outstanding.
BASIC NET INCOME PER SHARE AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS: The Company adopted
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings
Per Share effective December 31, 1997. This statement requires the presentation
of basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is calculated
by dividing net income available to common stockholders, adjusted for any
cumulative dividends on preferred stock earned during the year, by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per
share, is calculated giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares that
were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of
the incremental common shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible
preferred stock using the if converted method, convertible debt and exercise
of stock options and warrants for all periods. All prior period earnings per
share amounts have been restated to comply with this statement. See Note 14

with two banks in the amount of $50,000,000. The maturity date is May 19, 2000,
subject to automatic extensions of one year beyond the current maturity date at
the end of each year unless either bank delivers a notice of intention not to
extend the maturity date. At December 31, 1997, there were no acceptances
payable and $9,900,000 of this credit facility was used for open letters of
credit and $40,100,000 of the line of credit was unused and available.
Borrowings in the form of loans bear interest at the higher of the lead bank
Base Rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 05%. At December 31, 1997, the
interest rate in effect was 85%. Borrowings in the form of acceptances bear

In May 1993, the Company concurrently entered into Senior Note agreements in the
amount of $60,000,000 through a private placement of debt which bears interest

agreements, the Company is required to maintain certain financial ratios. The
most restrictive covenant requires the Company to maintain a minimum ratio of
income before interest, income taxes and fixed charges to interest and fixed
charges of 15 to 10. The Company revolving credit and Senior Note agreements
contain restrictive covenants regarding cash distributions to stockholders,
including the payment of dividends. Such cash distributions made or authorized

stores that were not performing up to its expectations. The Company recognized
an estimated $4,100,000 in nonrecurring pre-tax charges related to these
anticipated store closures in the quarter ended June 30, 1996. The store closure
charges consist primarily of the estimated costs to terminate the related leases
of the stores selected for closure. The actual amounts and timing of remaining
closures will be determined through agreements with the lessors. At December 31,
1997, $2,600,000 of the store closure charges are included in Accrued Expenses.                 Page 39 of 54          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

approximately $731,000 associated with these transactions have been included as
a component of equity.
12. Related Party Transactions The Company leases a retail store from two of its officers and directors. The
lease expires on August 31, 1999, with no renewal options. The Company paid
these officers and directors $154,000, $148,000 and $148,000 in lease costs

shares of the Company common stock to be granted or subject to options or
rights may not exceed 2,225,000 and no participant may be granted, in the
aggregate, awards that would result in the employee receiving more than 25% of
the maximum number of shares of common stock available for award under the

less than the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant and that no
portion of the option may be exercised beyond 10 years from that date. Options
