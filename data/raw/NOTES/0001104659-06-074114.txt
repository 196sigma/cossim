34 Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of FactSet
Research Systems Inc.
We have completed
integrated audits of FactSet Research Systems Inc.s 2006 and 2005 consolidated
financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of
August31, 2006, and an audit of its 2004 consolidated financial
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Our
opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule
In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements
listed in the accompanying indexpresent
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of FactSet Research
Systems Inc. and its subsidiaries at August31,
2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended August31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index
appearing under  presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 2 to
the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for share-based payment awards, effective September1, 2005.
Internal control
over financial reporting
Also, in our opinion, managements assessment,
included in the Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of August31, 2006 based on
criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore,
in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of August31, 2006, based on
criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express opinions on managements assessment andon the effectiveness
of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was  35 maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1. ORGANIZATION
AND NATURE OF BUSINESS
FactSet Research Systems Inc. the Company or FactSet
supplies financial intelligence to the global investment community. FactSet
applications support and make more efficient workflows for buy and sell-side
professionals. These professionals include portfolio managers, research and
performance analysts, risk managers, marketing professionals, sell-side equity
research professionals, investment bankers and fixed income professionals. FactSet
applications provide users access to company analysis, multicompany
comparisons, industry analysis, company screening, portfolio analysis,
predictive risk measurements, alphatesting, portfolio optimization and
simulation, real-time news and quotes and tools to value and analyze fixed
income securities and portfolios. The Company combines more than 200 databases,
including content regarding tens of thousands of companies and securities from
major markets across the globe into a single online platform of information and
analytics. Clients have simultaneous access to content from an array of
sources, which they can combine and utilize in FactSet applications. FactSet is
also fully integrated with Microsoft Office applications such as Excel, Word
and PowerPoint and allows for the creation of extensive custom reports.
FactSet revenues are derived from month-to-month
subscriptions to services such as workstations also referred to as users,
content and applications. At the option of each investment management client,
FactSet services may be paid either in commissions from securities transactions
or in cash. To facilitate the payment for services in commissions, the Companys
wholly owned subsidiary, FactSet Data Systems,Inc. FDS, is a member
of the National Association of Securities Dealers,Inc. and is a
registered broker-dealer under Section15 of the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934. Services paid in commissions are derived from securities
transactions introduced and cleared on a fully disclosed basis through clearing
brokers. That is, a client paying subscription charges on a commission basis
directs the clearing broker to credit the commission on the transaction to FDS
at the time the client executes a securities transaction. Clients may also
direct commissions to unrelated third party brokers and request cash be
transmitted to FactSet to pay for its services.
At August31, 2006,
the Company leased office space domestically in Norwalk, Connecticut; Boston,
Massachusetts; four locations in New York, New York; two locations in Chicago,
Illinois; Manchester, New Hampshire; Reston, Virginia; Newark, New Jersey;
Tuscaloosa, Alabama; San Mateo and Santa Monica, California; and outside the
U.S. in London; Tokyo; Hong Kong; Sydney; Singapore; Frankfurt; Milan; and
Paris and Avon, France. The leases expire on various dates through March2021.
Total minimum rental payments associated with the leases are recorded as rent
a component of selling, general and administrative expenses on a straight-line
basis over the periods of the respective non-cancelable lease terms. 42 2. ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
The
significant accounting policies of the Company and its subsidiaries are
summarized below.
Financial Statement
Presentation 
The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany activity and balances have been
eliminated from the consolidated financial statements.
Shares of common stock and
related per share amounts give retroactive effect for stock splits. All shares
of common stock and related per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect a
three-for-two common stock split, effected as a stock dividend, which occurred
on February4, 2005.
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant
estimates have been made in areas that include income and other taxes, useful
lives of fixed and intangible assets, accrued liabilities, accrued
compensation, stock-based compensation, receivable reserves, contingent
liabilities and allocation of purchase price to assets and liabilities
acquired. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition FactSet
applies Staff Accounting Bulletin No104 SAB 104, Revenue Recognition, to its business
arrangements for revenue recognition. Primarily all clients are invoiced
monthly, in arrears, to reflect the actual services provided. Remaining clients
are invoiced quarterly or annually in advance. Subscription revenue is earned
each month as the service is rendered to clients on a monthly basis. A
provision is estimated for billing adjustments and cancellations of service
related to prior periods. Such provisions are accounted for as a reduction of
subscription revenue, with a corresponding reduction to subscriptions
receivable. FactSet recognizes revenue when all the following criteria are met The
client subscribes to FactSet services the
FactSet service has been rendered and earned during the month the
amount of the subscription is fixed and determinable based on established rates
for each product offering, quoted on an annualized basis, and
collectibility
is reasonably assured.
Under the guidance in SAB
104, the Companys subscriptions represent a single earnings process.
Collection of subscription revenues through FDSs external clearing broker does
not represent a separate service or earnings process since FDS is not the
principal party to the settlement of the securities transactions for which the
clearing broker charges clearing fees. Clearing fees are recorded as a
reduction to revenues in the period incurred, at the time that a client
executes securities transactions through the clearing broker. TheCompany
earns the right to recover the clearing fee from its clients at the time the
securities transactions are executed, which is the period in which the clearing
fees are incurred. 43 Amounts that have been
earned but not yet paid through the receipt of commissions on securities
transactions or through cash payments are reflected on the Consolidated
Statements of Financial Condition as receivables from clients and clearing
broker, net. As of August31, 2006, the amount of receivables from clients
and clearing broker, net that was unbilled totaled $329 million. Since the
Company invoices its clients monthly in arrears, the $329 million unbilled as
of August31, 2006 was billed at the beginning of September2006.
Amounts that have been received through commissions on securities transactions
or through cash payments that are in excess of earned subscription revenues are
reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as deferred
fees.
The Company calculates a
receivable reserve through analyzing aged client receivables each month and
reviewing historical Company information, industry trends and general market
conditions. As of August31, 2006 and 2005, the receivable reserve was
$12 million and $11 million, respectively.
Cost of Services
Cost of services is
composed of cash and stock-based compensation and benefits for the software
engineering and consulting groups, data costs, amortization of identifiable
intangible assets, computer maintenance and depreciation expenses and
client-related communication costs.
Selling, General
and Administrative
Selling, general and
administrative expense include cash and stock-based compensation and benefits
for the sales, product development and various other support departments,
travel and entertainment expenses, promotional costs, rent, amortization of
leasehold improvements, depreciation of furniture and fixtures, office
expenses, professional fees and other expenses.
Cash and Cash
Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents
consist of demand deposits and money market investments with maturities of
three months or less at the date of acquisition and are reported at fair value.
Investments 
Investments which have
maturities greater than three months from the date of acquisition are
classified as available-for-sale securities and are reported at fair value.
Fair value of investments is determined from readily available quoted market
prices. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are
included net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in
stockholders equity.
Property, Equipment
and Leasehold Improvements 
Computers and related
equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives
of three years or less. Alpha mainframes purchased after April2006 are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of two years.
Depreciation of furniture and fixtures is recognized using the double declining
balance method over estimated useful lives between five and seven years.
Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of
the related leases or estimated useful lives of the improvements, whichever
period is shorter. 44 Goodwill 
Goodwill has resulted from
the acquisitions of the Insyte, LionShares, Mergerstat, CallStreet, JCF, TrueCourse,
DSI, AlphaMetrics and Global Filings businesses. Goodwill resulting from the
acquisitions of Insyte, LionShares, Mergerstat, CallStreet, JCF, AlphaMetrics
and Global Filings are income tax-deductible based on the structure of the
acquisition. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates goodwill at the
reporting unit level for indications of potential impairment. Goodwill is
tested for impairment based on the present value of discounted cash flows, and,
if impaired, written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows. Based
on the guidance in SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, the Company has determined that there were three
reporting units during fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, which are consistent
with the operating segments reported under SFAS 131, Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information because
there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries
within each operating segment. The Companys reporting units evaluated for
potential impairment during fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 were U.S., Europe
and Asia Pacific, which reflects the level of internal reporting the Companys uses to manage its
business and operations. The Company performed an annual goodwill
impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004
and determined that there had been no impairment.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets
primarily consist of customer relationships, acquired technology, trade names,
non-compete agreements, and certain acquired content databases resulting from
the acquisitions of the Insyte, LionShares, Mergerstat, CallStreet, JCF,
TrueCourse, DSI, AlphaMetrics and Global Filings businesses and depending on
the nature of the intangible asset, are amortized on either a straight-line or
an accelerated basis using estimated useful lives ranging between two and
twenty years. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may
not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of
undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its
eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets
that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying
value exceeds the fair value of the asset. There has been no impairment of intangible
assets as of August31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Internal Use
Software 
Certain costs related to
computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized in
accordance with Statement of Position No98-1, Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.
The Company capitalizes only those direct costs incurred during the application
development and implementation stages for developing, purchasing or otherwise
acquiring software for internal use that management believes have a probable
future application in the Companys subscription-based service.
Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the underlying software, generally two years or less. During
fiscal 2006 the Company capitalized $03million of internal employee
compensation costs associated with the application development and
implementation stages for developing software for internal use only. There were
no internal employee compensation costs capitalized as of August31, 2005. 45 Product Development
The Company capitalizes
software development costs related to software to be sold, leased, or otherwise
marketed in accordance with SFAS No86, Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed SFAS
86. Capitalized software development costs include purchased materials and
services, the salary and benefits for the Companys development and technical
support staff and other costs associated with the enhancements of existing
products and services and development of new products and services. Software
development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has
been established, at which time such costs are capitalized until the product is
available for general release to the public. Once the point of technological
feasibility is reached, which is generally the completion of a working
prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release
candidate or has alternative future uses, development costs are capitalized
until the product is ready for general release. Capitalized software
development costs are amortized over the estimated product useful life,
principally three years using the straight-line method. Research and product
development costs not subject to SFAS 86 are expensed as incurred. As of August31,
2006 and 2005, there were no software development costs capitalized in
accordance with SFAS 86.
Landlord
Contributions to Leasehold Improvements 
In conjunction with
entering into leases for office space, the Company receives contributions from
landlords toward leasehold improvements which are included in the Deferred Rent
and Other Non-Current Liabilities line item of the Companys Consolidated
Statements of Financial Condition. These contributions are amortized as a
reduction to rent expense over the non-cancelable lease terms to which they
pertain.
Accrued Liabilities Accrued liabilities
include estimates relating to employee compensation, operating expenses and tax
liabilities. Most of the Companys employee incentive compensation programs are
discretionary. A final review of corporate, departmental and individual
performance is conducted each year to determine the ultimate amount of
discretionary bonus pools.
Income and Deferred
Taxes 
Deferred taxes are
determined by calculating the future tax consequences associated with
differences between financial accounting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities. A valuation allowance is established to the extent management
considers it more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes from income tax law
changes is recognized immediately upon enactment. The deferred tax provision is
derived from changes in deferred taxes on the balance sheet and reflected on
the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of income taxes.
On September1, 2005,
the Company adopted SFAS 123R. The Company has elected the transition method
provided in SFAS 123Rfor calculating the tax effects of stock-based
compensation pursuant to SFAS 123R. The transition method establishes the
beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool APIC pool related
to the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation and determines the
subsequent impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of
the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation awards that are
outstanding upon adoption of SFAS 123R. 46 Comprehensive
Income Loss 
The Company reports
comprehensive income loss in accordance with SFAS No130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. SFAS No130
establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income
loss in a set of financial statements. Comprehensive income loss is defined
as the change in net assets of a business enterprise during a period from
transactions generated from non-owner sources. It includes all changes in
equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and
distributions to owners.
Foreign Currency
Effective September1,
2005, the Companys wholly owned subsidiaries within the European segment no
longer operate as branch offices and operate under a functional currency
different from that of the Company. The financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries
are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets
and liabilities, and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses.
Translation gains losses that
arise from translating assets and liabilities of foreign operations are recorded
in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a component of stockholders
equity.
Prior to September1,
2005, the functional currency of our wholly owned subsidiaries, excluding JCF,
was the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the foreign currency exchange gains and
losses from translating net monetary assets were included in net income.
A portion of the Companys
non-U.S. clients are billed in local currencies such as the Euro, British Pound
Sterling and the Japanese Yen, in their native foreign jurisdictions.
Volatility in these and other currencies may have either positive or negative
effects on total reported revenues. During fiscal 2006, the Companys expenses
recorded in non-dollar denominated currencies exceeded its revenues billed in
non-dollar denominated currencies by approximately $133 million.
Historically, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the Companys
results of operations has not been material. The Company does not utilize any
hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to foreign
currency-denominated transactions.
Earnings
per Share 
Basic net income per share
is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted
average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares
outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of
employee stock options and restricted common stock. SFAS No128, Earnings per Share, requires that employee equity share
options, non-vested shares and similar equity instruments granted by the
Company be treated as potential common shares outstanding in computing diluted
earnings per share. Diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of
in-the-money options which is calculated based on the average share price for
each fiscal period using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock
method, the exercise price paid by the optionee, future stock-based
compensation expense that the Company has not yet recognized, and the amount of
tax benefits that would be recorded in additional paid-in capital when the
award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares. 47 Stock-Based
Compensation 
On September1, 2005,
the Company adopted SFAS 123Rwhich requires the measurement and
recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to
employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock
purchases related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan employee stock
purchases based on estimated fair values. SFAS 123Rsupersedes the
Companys previous accounting under APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 for
periods beginning on September1, 2005. Prior to the adoption of SFAS
123R, the Company accounted for stock-based awards to employees and directors
using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB 25 as allowed under
SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS 123. In March2005, the Securities and
Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No107, Share-Based Payment, SAB107 relating to SFAS
123R. The Company has applied the provisions of SAB 107 in its adoption of
SFAS123R.
The Company adopted SFAS
123Rusing the modified prospective transition method, which requires
the application of the accounting standard as of September1, 2005, the
first day of the Companys 2006 fiscal year. The Companys consolidated
financial statements for the fiscal year ended August31, 2006 reflect the
impact of SFAS 123R. In accordance with the modified prospective transition
method, the Companys consolidated financial statements for prior periods have
not been restated to reflect, and do not include the impact of SFAS 123R.
Stock-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS123Rfor the
fiscal year ended August31, 2006 was $84 million. There was no
stock-based compensation expense recognized during the 2005 and 2004 fiscal
years.
Stock Option Awards
The Company estimates the fair value of awards on the
date of grant using an option-pricing model. Non-performance based options expire
either seven or ten years from the date of grant and vest at a rate of 20%
after the first year and 167% per month thereafter for years two through five.
Performance based options expire seven years from the date of grant and, in
addition to the related performance conditions, vest at a rate of 40% after the
first two years and 167% per month thereafter for years three through five.
Options become vested and exercisable provided the employee continues
employment with the Company through the applicable vesting date, and remain
exercisable until expiration or cancellation. Performance-based options require
management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company
performance goals. The number of performance-based options that ultimately vest
will be predicated on the Company achieving certain financial performance
levels for fiscal years 2007 and 2008. Dependent on the financial performance
levels attained by FactSet during fiscal years 2007 and 2008, 0%, 20%, 60% or
100% of the performance-based stock options will ultimately vest to the
grantees of those stock options. Based on the Companys current business
outlook for fiscal years 2007 and 2008, 20% of the performance-based stock
options are estimated to vest.
Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company elected to
use the straight-line attribution method for all awards with graded vesting
features and service conditions only. It was the Companys policy decision upon
the adoption of SFAS 123Rand is applied consistently for all awards
with similar features granted or modified after the date of adoption. Under
this method, the amount of compensation cost that is recognized on any date is
at least equal to the vested portion of the award on that date. In accordance
with footnote 85 of SFAS 123R, for all stock-based awards with performance
conditions, the graded vesting  48 attribution method is used
by the Company to determine the monthly stock-based compensation expense over
the applicable vesting periods.
Stock-based compensation expense recognized is based
on the value of share awards that are scheduled to vest during the period.
Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Companys Consolidated
Statement of Income during fiscal 2006 included compensation expense for stock
options and restricted stock not vested as of September1, 2005.
Compensation expense was calculated using the grant date fair value estimated
under the pro forma provisions of SFAS 123 and provisions of SFAS123Rfor
awards issued subsequent to August31, 2005. SFAS 123Rrequires
forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in
subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. In the
Companys pro forma information required under SFAS 123 for the periods prior
to fiscal 2006, the Company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred.
Commencing with the third
quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company transitioned from the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model to a lattice-binomial option-pricing model binomial
model to estimate the fair value of new stock option grants. Management
believes the binomial model provides a more refined estimate of the fair value
of the Companys employee stock options. The Companys determination of fair
value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using the binomial
model is affected by the Companys stock price as well as assumptions regarding
a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include,
but are not limited to the Companys expected stock price volatility over the
term of the awards, interest rates and actual employee stock option exercise
behaviors.
Restricted Stock
Awards
The Company granted
restricted stock awards which entitle the holder to shares of common stock as
the award vests over time. Restricted stock grants are amortized to expense
over the vesting period using the straight-line method. The Company granted
49,178 shares of common stock in restricted stock grants in fiscal 2005. Based
on the $3751 average market price of FactSet common stock on the grant date, a
deferred compensation charge of $18 million was recorded as a reduction to
capital in excess of par value in stockholders equity and is being amortized
ratably to stock-based compensation expense over the vesting period of four
years. There were no restricted stock grants in fiscal 2006.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In September2005, FASB issued FSP No.SFAS
123R-1 to defer the requirement of SFAS123Rthat a
freestanding financial instrument originally subject to SFAS 123Rbecomes
subject to the recognition and measurement requirements of other applicable
GAAP when the rights conveyed by the instrument to the holder are no longer
dependent on the holder being an employee of the entity. The rights under
stock-based payment awards issued to employees by the Company are all dependent
on the recipient being an employee of the Company. Therefore, this FSP
currently does not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial
statements and its measurement of stock-based compensation in accordance with
SFAS 123R.
In October2005, the FASB issued FSP No.SFAS
123R-2 to provide guidance on determining the grant date for an award
as defined in SFAS 123R. This FSP stipulates that assuming all other criteria
in the grant date definition are met, a mutual understanding of the key terms
and conditions of an award to an individual employee is presumed to exist upon
the awards approval in accordance with the relevant  49 corporate governance
requirements, provided that the key terms and conditions of an award acannot
be negotiated by the recipient with the employer because the award is a
unilateral grant, and bare expected to be communicated to an individual
recipient within a relatively short time period from the date of approval. The
Company has applied the principles set forth in this FSP upon its adoption of
SFAS 123R.
In November2005, the FASB issued FSP No.SFAS
123R-3 to provide an alternate transition method for the implementation
of SFAS 123R. Because some entities do not have, and may not be able to
re-create, information about the net excess tax benefits that would have
qualified as such had those entities adopted SFAS 123Rfor recognition
purposes, this FSP provides an elective alternative transition method. That
method comprises aa computational component that establishes a
beginning balance of the APIC pool related to employee compensation and ba
simplified method to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool of
employee awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon the adoption of SFAS
123R. The Company has applied the alternative transition method set forth in
this FSP upon its adoption of SFAS123R.
In February2006, the FASB issued FSP No.SFAS123R-4
to address the classification of options and similar instruments issued as
employee compensation that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a
contingent event. The guidance in this FSP amends paragraphs32 and A229
of SFAS123R. The Companys employee stock option plans have no cash
settlement provisions. Therefore, this FSP currently does not have an impact on
the Companys consolidated financial statements or its measurement of
stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS123R.
In June2006, the FASB issued FIN48. This
interpretation clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized
in accordance with SFAS109. Specifically, FIN48 clarifies the
application of SFAS109 by defining a criterion that an individual tax
position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be
recognized in an enterprises financial statements. Additionally, FIN48
provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and
penalties, accounting in interim periods of income taxes, as well as the
required disclosure and transition. This interpretation is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating
the requirements of FIN48 and have not yet determined if the adoption of
FIN48 will have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated
financial statements.
In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS157.
Among other requirements, SFAS157 defines fair value and establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and also expands disclosure about the use of
fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS157 is effective
beginning the first fiscal year that begins after November15, 2007. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS157 on its financial
position and results of operations.
In September2006,
the Securities and Exchange Commission issued SAB108, which provides
interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior
year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year
misstatement. The guidance is applicable for fiscal years ending after
November15, 2006. The Company does not believe SAB108 will have a
material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 50 3. COMMON STOCK AND
EARNINGS PER SHARE
On August18,
2006, the Company announced a regular quarterly dividend of $006 per share. The
cash dividend was paid on September19, 2006, to common stockholders of

Share Repurchase Program
On June20, 2005, the
Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50million
of FactSet common stock. Repurchases will be made from time to time in the open
market and privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions. No
minimum number of shares to be repurchased has been fixed. During fiscal 2006,
the Company repurchased 320,900 shares at an average cost of $4329 per share
under the program. At August31, 2006, $361million remains
authorized for future share repurchases. The remaining 64,935 shares
repurchased during fiscal 2006 were repurchases of common stock owned by
employees in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan, which was terminated on June20,
2005.
During fiscal 2005,
FactSet repurchased 342,500 shares at an average cost of $2771 per share. As a
result, the Company completed the stock repurchase program authorized by the
Board of Directors on July16, 2002. Under the program, FactSet
repurchased 1,500,000 shares at an average cost of $2003 per share. The
remaining repurchases during fiscal 2005 were repurchases of common stock owned
by employees in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan.
Shares issued in Business Combinations
On August1, 2005,
the Company issued 305,748 common shares as part of the acquisition price of
DSI. On January4, 2005, the Company issued 44,613 common shares as part
of the acquisition price of TrueCourse. On September1, 2004, the Company
issued 385,601 common shares as part of the acquisition price of the JCF Group
of Companies.
Other Share Activity
In January2004, the
Company purchased 3,000,000 shares of its common stock from one of its
co-founders, Howard E. Wille, at a price per share of $2305. In March2004,
the Company purchased 1,500,000 shares of its common stock from its other
co-founder, Charles J. Snyder, at a price per share of $2541. The Board of
Directors approved both purchases of common stock from its co-founders prior to
the execution of those purchases. The total cash expended for the two common
stock purchases was $1073million. 51 Employee Stock Ownership Plan
On March30, 2005,
the Board of Directors resolved that effective September1, 2004, the
Companys Employee Stock Ownership Plan the ESOP or Plan was frozen with
the result that no additional employees shall become participants and no
additional employer contributions will be made for plan years commencing on and
after September1, 2004. Also, effective September1, 2004 all
participants became 100% vested in their account balances. On June20,
2005, the Board of Directors approved the termination of the ESOP, effective
immediately. Account balances of participants are being distributed in
accordance with provisions of the plan.

acquisitions were not material on the Companys consolidated financial results.
5. INTANGIBLE
ASSETS
The Companys identifiable intangible assets consist
primarily of acquired technology, customer relationships, certain acquired
content databases, trade names, and non-compete agreements resulting from the
acquisitions of the Insyte, LionShares, Mergerstat, CallStreet, JCF, TrueCourse,
DSI, AlphaMetrics and Global Filings businesses in August2000, April2001,
January2003, May2004, September2004, January2005, August2005,
September2005, and February2006, respectively. During fiscal 2006 85million of identifiable intangible assets were added as a result of
the acquisition of the AlphaMetrics business and Global Filings. The acquired
businesses and related assets have been fully integrated into the Companys
operations. The weighted average useful life of all acquired intangible assets
is 98 years at August31, 2006.
The Company amortizes intangible assets over their
estimated useful lives. Amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment
based on undiscounted cash flows, and, if impaired, written down to fair value
based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. No impairment of
intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented.
These intangible assets have no assigned residual values. During fiscal 2006,
the Company reassessed the estimated useful lives and classification of its
identifiable intangible assets and determined that they are still appropriate.

8. INVESTMENTS
The Company maintains a portfolio of investments that
is managed to preserve principal. Pursuant to the investment guidelines
established by the Company, the Companys investments attempt to achieve high
levels of credit quality, liquidity and diversification. The weighted average
duration of the Companys portfolios is managed not to exceed two years.
Eligible investments include obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury and other
governmental agencies, money market securities and highly rated commercial
paper and corporate securities. Investments such as puts, calls, strips,
straddles, short sales, futures, options, commodities, precious metals or
investments on margin are not permitted under the Companys investment
guidelines. All investments are denominated in U.S. dollars and recorded at
their approximate fair values.
Investments, classified as
available-for-sale securities, totaled $166million at August31,
2006 and 2005, respectively. Fair value of investments was determined from
readily available quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities were included net of tax in accumulated other
comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity at August31, 2006 and
2005, respectively.

TAXES
In the normal course of business, the Companys tax
filings are subject to audit by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.
Audits by five tax authorities are currently ongoing. There is inherent
uncertainty in the audit process. The Company made its best estimate of the
probable liabilities that exist and recorded an estimate. The Company has no
reason to believe that such audits will result in the payment of additional
taxes or penalties, or both, that would have a material adverse effect on the
Companys results of operations or financial position, beyond current
estimates.

During fiscal 2006, the
Company filed an application for change in accounting method with the IRS as a
result of IRS Revenue Procedure 2004-34, allowing advanced cash
collections to be recognized as income in the same period such revenue is
recorded for GAAP purposes. This resulted in a $34 million reduction to

COMMITMENTS
The Company leases office space in the U.S. in
Norwalk, Connecticut; Newark, New Jersey; Boston, Massachusetts; New York, New
York; Chicago, Illinois; Manchester, New Hampshire; Reston, Virginia;
Tuscaloosa, Alabama; San Mateo and Santa Monica, California; and outside the
U.S. in London; Tokyo; Hong Kong; Sydney; Frankfurt; Milan; and Paris and Avon,
France. The leases expire on various dates through March2021. Total
minimum rental payments associated with the leases are recorded as rent a
component of selling, general and administrative expenses on a straight-line
basis over the periods of the respective non-cancelable lease terms. 60 During fiscal 2006, the Company agreed to extend
existing leases for office space in Chicago, Illinois and Frankfurt, Germany
through the years 2016 and 2011, respectively. The Chicago lease included an
expansion for additional office space commencing in fiscal 2007, which will
result in incremental future minimum rental payments of $40 million over the
remaining non-cancelable lease term. The Frankfurt lease agreement was an
extension to an existing lease and will result in incremental future minimum
rental payments of $14 million over the remaining non-cancelable lease term.
On January19, 2006, the Company agreed to lease
space to serve as the new headquarters for Companys London-based operations.
The new location is governed by a 15-year lease with an option to extend
for an additional 10 years. The Company consolidated its four London-based
offices into one, new location. The Company continued to occupy its existing
leased office space until the new facility was ready for occupancy on June19,
2006.
At August31,
2006, the Companys lease commitments for office space provide for the
following future minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases
with remaining terms in excess of one year in thousands

12. STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION
Effective September1, 2005, the Company adopted
SFAS 123Rwhich requires the measurement and recognition of compensation
expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors. For
the Company, these awards include employee stock options, common shares
acquired under employee stock purchases and restricted stock. SFAS 123Rsupersedes
the Companys previous accounting under APB 25 for periods prior to September1,
2005. The Company adopted the modified prospective transition method as
provided by SFAS 123R. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statement
amounts for the prior periods have not been restated to reflect stock-based
compensation expense. 61 The
following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense under SFAS
123Rfor the twelve months ended August31, 2006 which was

As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the
Consolidated Statement of Income during fiscal 2006 is based on awards
ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
SFAS123Rrequires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant
and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based primarily on historical
experience. In the Companys pro forma information required under SFAS 123 for
the periods prior to fiscal 2006, the Company accounted for forfeitures as they
occurred.
As of August31,
2006, $254million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to
non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period
of 383 years. There were no
stock-based compensation costs capitalized as of August31, 2006.
13. EMPLOYEE
STOCK OPTION AND RETIREMENT PLANS
Stock Option Plans
Options granted without
performance conditions under the Companys stock option plans the Option
Plans expire either seven or ten years from the date of grant and vest at a
rate of 20% after the first year and 167% per month thereafter for years two
through five. Options become vested and exercisable provided the employee continues
employment with the Company through the applicable vesting date, and remain
exercisable until expiration or cancellation. Options granted with performance
conditions under the Companys 2004 Stock Option Plan expire seven years from
the date of grant and vest at a rate of 40% after the first two years and 167%
per month thereafter for years three through five. The number of
performance-based options that ultimately vest is based on the Company
achieving certain financial performance levels during fiscal years 2007 and
2008. Dependent on the financial performance  62 levels
attained, 0%, 20%, 60% or 100% of the performance-based stock options will
ultimately vest to the grantees of those stock options. Based on the Companys
current outlook, the Company has estimated that 20% or 184,998 of the
performance-based stock options should vest. This estimate results in
stock-based compensation expense of $26million to be recognized by the
Company over the next five years. Options generally are not transferable or
assignable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. During
the grantees lifetime, they may be exercised only by the grantee.
General Option Activity
In fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, incentive and
nonqualified stock options to purchase 1,608,890; 1,344,000; and 1,244,700
shares of common stock, respectively, at prices which ranged from $2449 to
$4339 were granted to employees and non-employee directors of the Company.
On December19, 2004, the Companys shareholders
approved the 2004 Stock Option Plan which increased the number of stock options
available for future issuance by 75million. At August31, 2006,
there were 6,316,000 shares available for future grants under the Option Plans.

based on the Companys closing stock price of $4410 as of August31,
2006, which would have been received by the option holders had all option
holders exercised their options as of that date. The total number of
in-the-money options exercisable as of August31, 2006 was 44million
with a weighted average exercise price of $2003. As of August31, 2005,
42million outstanding options were exercisable, and the weighted average
exercise price was $1830.
Stock Option Fair Value Determination
Commencing with the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the
Company transitioned from the Black-Scholes options model to a lattice-binomial
model to estimate the fair value of new employee stock options on the date of
grant. Management believes the lattice-binomial option pricing model provides a
more refined estimate of the fair value of the Companys employee stock
options. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of the
grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for all grants prior to March2005.
For option grants in March2005 and thereafter, the fair value of each
option grant is estimated on the date of the grant using the lattice-binomial
option pricing model. Because
the lattice-binomial option pricing model incorporates ranges of assumptions
for inputs, those ranges are disclosed.
There were 1,608,890 employee stock options granted
during fiscal 2006. The weighted average estimated value of employee stock
options granted during fiscal 2006 was $1583 per share, using the
lattice-binomial option model. For the six months ended August31, 2005,
1,297,620 employee stock  64 options were granted. The
weighted average estimated value of employee stock options granted during the
six months ended August31, 2005 was $899 per share, using the
lattice-binomial option model.
The
weighted average estimated value of employee stock options granted during
fiscal 2006 and the six months ended August31, 2005, was determined using
the lattice-binomial option model with the following weighted average
assumptions

The risk-free interest rate assumption for periods
within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield
curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatility is based on the
historical volatility of the Companys stock. The Company uses historical data
to estimate option exercises and employee termination within the valuation
model. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Companys history and
expectation of dividend payouts.
The expected life of
employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options
are expected to remain outstanding and is a derived output of the
lattice-binomial model. The expected life of employee stock options is impacted
by all of the underlying assumptions and calibration of the Companys model.
The lattice-binomial model assumes that employees exercise behavior is a
function of the options remaining vested life and the extent to which the
option is in-the-money. The lattice-binomial model estimates the probability of
exercise as a function of these two variables based on the entire history of
exercises and cancellations of all past option grants made by the Company.
Accuracy of Fair
Value Estimates
The Company uses third-party analyses to assist in
developing the assumptions used in, as well as calibrating, its
lattice-binomial model. The Company is responsible for determining the
assumptions used in estimating the fair value of its share-based payment
awards.
The Companys
determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant
using an option-pricing model is affected by the Companys stock price as well
as assumptions regarding a  65 number
of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are
not limited to the Companys expected stock price volatility over the term of
the awards, interest rates and actual and projected employee stock option
exercise behaviors. Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating
the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and
are fully transferable.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company implemented an Employee Stock Purchase
Plan the Purchase Plan in fiscal 2001 for all eligible employees. Under the
Purchase Plan, shares of the Companys common stock may be purchased at
three-month intervals at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of FactSet
common stock on the first or the last day of each three-month period. Employee
purchases may not exceed 10% of their gross compensation during an offering
period. During fiscal 2006, employees purchased 88,500 shares at an average
price of $3718. At August31, 2006, 273,000 shares were reserved for
future issuance under the Purchase Plan.
The
Company continues to use the Black-Scholes model to calculate the estimated
fair value for the employee stock purchase plan. The weighted average estimated
value of employee stock purchase plan grants during fiscal years 2006, 2005 and
2004 were $779, $732 and $885 per share, respectively. The following
weighted average assumptions were used to calculate the estimated fair value of
employee stock purchase plan grants for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004

Restricted Stock Awards
The Company stock option
plans permit the issuance of restricted stock and restricted stock units.
Restricted stock awards are subject to continued employment over a specified
period. During fiscal 2005, The Company granted restricted stock awards which
entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests over time. The
Companys restricted stock awards generally vest ratably over a four-year
period. Restricted stock grants are amortized to expense over the vesting
period using the straight-line attribution method. The Company granted 49,178
shares of common stock in restricted stock grants during fiscal 2005. Based on
the $3751 average market price of FactSet common stock on the grant date, a
deferred compensation charge of $18million was recorded to stockholders
equity, and is being amortized ratably to compensation expense over the vesting
period of four years. Compensation expense recorded by the Company was $391,000
and $38,000 during fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. In connection with the
adoption of SFAS 123Rbeginning in fiscal 2006, the Company recorded an
adjustment to deferred compensation in the amount of $222,000 to reflect an
estimated forfeiture rate. SFAS 123Rrequires forfeitures to be
estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods
if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. 66 Employee Stock Ownership Plan

2005. There were no authorized contributions in fiscal 2006 or 2005. The Board
of Directors authorized contributions in the amounts of $22million for

of services and selling, general and administrative as compensation expense. On
June20, 2005, the Board of Directors terminated the Plan. Distributions
were paid in the form of cash or the Companys common stock. In cash
distributions, the Company purchases the common stock in the participants ESOP
account at the closing price of the Companys common stock on the last day of
the month in which the distribution is requested by the participant of the
Plan. These repurchases of common stock from employees are included in both
treasury stock on the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders
Equity and in cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.
The Plan held 49,127;
724,598 and 2,144,414 shares of the Companys common stock at August31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

15. REVOLVING
CREDIT FACILITIES
In March2006, the
Company renewed its 364-day revolving credit facility and continued to
maintain its three-year credit facility. The credit facilities the facilities
are available in an aggregate principal amount of up to $250million for
working capital and general corporate purposes, with the facilities split into
two equal tranches and maturing in March2007 and March2008. Approximately
$30million in aggregate of these credit facilities has been utilized for
letters of credit issued during the ordinary course of business as of August31,
2006. The Company is obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of
the facilities at a weighted average annual rate of 0125%. The facilities also
contain covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain
minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge
ratios.
16. OFF-BALANCE
SHEET RISK AND CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
In the normal course of business, securities
transactions of commission clients of FDS are cleared through its clearing
brokers. Pursuant to an agreement between FDS and its clearing brokers, the
clearing brokers have the right to charge FDS for unsecured losses that result
from a clients failure to complete such transactions. The Company has never
experienced significant losses and, therefore, has not recorded a liability
with regard to the right. The Company seeks to control the credit risk of
nonperformance by considering the creditworthiness of its clients.
Receivables from clearing brokers represent a
concentration of credit risk in that securities transactions cleared through
its clearing broker bear the potential for liability if unwound or
unconsummated. 69 Financial instruments,
which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist
principally of trade accounts receivable. The Company periodically reviews its
accounts receivable for collectibility and provides for an allowance for
doubtful accounts to the extent that amounts are not expected to be collected.
No individual client accounted for more than 3% of total subscriptions as of August31,
2006. Subscriptions from the ten largest clients did not surpass 15% of total
client subscriptions.
17. NOTE
