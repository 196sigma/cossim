Item 8--Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Seasonality
Our revenue and gross margins vary from quarter to quarter as a result of
the level of business volumes and seasonality of demand.
Our contracts with key customers generally provide a framework for the
overall relationship with the customer. Actual production volumes are based on
purchase orders for the delivery of systems. We minimize risk relative to our
production inventory, which comprised 197% of our total inventory as at
December 31, 2002, by ordering materials and components mainly to the extent
necessary to satisfy customer orders.
Our annual and quarterly operating results are primarily affected by the
level and timing of customer orders. Historically, we have experienced seasonal
variation in revenue, with revenue typically being highest in the second and
third quarters and lowest in the first and fourth quarters.
Trends in our revenues and cost of sales
Service revenue accounted for approximately 21% of our total revenues in
2002, as compared to approximately 99% for 2001. The increase of service
revenue as a percentage of total revenues resulted in a decrease in our overall
gross margins in 2002.
We are witnessing increased competition in the food retailing industry
among traditional supermarket chains and low-cost supercenter operators. This
competition is putting pressure on the profitability and performance of some of
our core customers, which could lead to continuing reluctance on their part to
spend on capital, if and when general economic conditions in North America
improve.
Gross margins on the sale of U-Scan systems in 2003 are expected to remain
consistent with gross margins realized in 2002. Gross margins on service
contracts are expected to increase during 2003 as a result of leveraging within
our customer base.                    15   We continue to focus on taking advantage of economies of scale and reducing
the costs of installing and servicing our systems. One of the primary
responsibilities of our purchasing department is the sourcing of new suppliers
and obtaining the best possible component prices. As a result of these
cost-cutting initiatives, we achieved a reduction in some of our component costs
in 2002. In addition, during the course of the year, we transitioned from using
third party support providers to mainly using our own technicians, to provide
service under our after-sales maintenance contracts, which we expect will result
in a significant reduction in the costs of providing this service.
We continue to make investments in certain areas of our infrastructure to
support our plan to further increase our penetration of existing customer
accounts and sell to new customers.
On February 27, 2003 we reduced our workforce by approximately 12% in an
effort to increase operating efficiencies in each department, decrease overall
general and administrative expenses and improve financial results. We expect
this employment reduction to produce annualized cost savings of approximately
$30 million.
Acquisition of Alpha Microsystems
On May 29, 2001, we acquired certain assets and the ongoing business of
Alpha Microsystems, LLC Alpha, based in Santa Ana, California, for a total
purchase price of approximately $68 million, of which $57 million was paid by
the assumption of liabilities and $11 million was paid in cash. The acquired
assets formed the basis for the Optimal Systems Services division of our
company. Optimal System Services performs installation and on-site service
support for the U-Scan systems as well as computer hardware maintenance support
for third party accounts. See note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial
statements, which are included in Item 8--Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data.
Critical accounting policies
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our
estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, investments,
intangible assets, income taxes, and contingencies and litigation. We base our
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
A critical accounting policy is one that is important to the understanding
of a company financial condition and results of operations and requires the
management of the company to exercise judgment or make estimates. We believe the
following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements     o Revenue Recognition: Approximately 80% of our revenues are derived
from the sale of our U-Scan systems. Revenue from these product sales is
recognized upon shipment, delivery or upon customer acceptance of the
product, based upon the terms as defined in the customer contract. In
general, sales to a retail chain follow a three-step process, in which the
customer takes delivery of a single U-Scan station for testing purposes,
then places a full system in a store for evaluation and finally decides
whether to commit to a volume order. No revenue is recognized for a new
customer until the customization and integration process is complete and
accepted by the customer. Installation service revenue, which is billed
separately from product sales, is recognized at the time the service has
been provided to the customer. Installations can be performed by our
technicians, by the customer trained and certified employees, or by
certified third party installers. Revenue from maintenance, which is
subject to separate service and support contracts, is deferred and
amortized ratably over the term of the contract.
o Inventories: Raw material inventory is stated at the lower of landed
cost or replacement cost. Finished goods and work in process inventory are
stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on
the basis of weighted average costs.                    16   In order to provide maintenance and repair services to our customers, we
are required to maintain significant levels of replacement parts. Parts are
stated at cost, less an allowance for obsolescence and shrinkage. The costs
of refurbishing parts are included in the cost of sales as incurred.
Periodic revisions to allowance estimates are required, based upon the
evaluation of several factors, including changes in estimated product life
cycles, usage levels, and technological changes. Changes in these estimates
are reflected immediately in income. Management bases its allowance
estimates on the expected service life of replacement parts and its
expectation as to parts obsolescence.
Supplementary measure of net earnings
The Company tax provision includes the effect of future taxes on
unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses, which arise on the conversion of
short-term investments and other monetary assets and liabilities into Canadian
dollars for purposes of determining taxable income under Canadian income tax
regulations. Because the U.S. dollar is our measurement currency and our
consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, these foreign
exchange gains/losses do not impact earnings before income taxes even though the
income tax provision includes a net tax liability for these gains/losses. In
2002, our tax provision includes a future tax recovery of $178,000 related to
unrealized foreign exchange gains compared to a charge of $2,173,000 for 2001.
To illustrate the impact of the foreign exchange gains/losses, management has
also included in this discussion a supplementary measure of net earnings as a
measure of its operating performance, which excludes the effects of future
income taxes on unrealized foreign exchange gains/losses. Supplementary net
earnings is not a measure of performance under Canadian GAAP or U.S. GAAP and
should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings
prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP or U.S. GAAP. See note 16 of the notes
to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item
8--Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Functional currency
During the third quarter of fiscal 2000, we determined that our functional
currency had clearly changed from the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar as at
the beginning of the quarter. As a result of this change, which has been applied
prospectively from July 1, 2000, transactions denominated in currencies other
than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using the temporal method.
Under this method, monetary assets and liabilities are translated into U.S.
dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary
assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at historical exchange
rates. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange
rates prevailing at the dates of the respective transactions. Translation gains
and losses are reflected in the statement of operations.
Prior to July 1, 2000, our functional currency was the Canadian dollar.
Accordingly, the financial statements were translated from Canadian dollars into
U.S. dollars using the current rate method. Gains and losses resulting from
translation of the financial statements were included in the cumulative
translation adjustment in shareholders' equity. The translated amounts for the
non-monetary items as at June 30, 2000 become the historical basis for those
items in subsequent periods. With the adoption of the U.S. dollar as our
functional currency on July 1, 2000, the amount of the cumulative translation
adjustment became fixed.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
141, Business Combinations and SFAS 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. SFAS 141, which replaces APB Opinion No. 16, revises the accounting
standards for business combinations and is effective for acquisitions initiated
after June 30, 2001. SFAS 142, which replaces APB Opinion No. 17, revises the
standards in accounting for goodwill and other intangibles and is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Similar standards have been
adopted by the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants the CICA.
Effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2002, SFAS 142 changes the
accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment-only
approach, with the effect that goodwill and other intangibles determined to have
an indefinite life are no longer to be amortized but are to be tested for
impairment at least annually. In addition, SFAS 142 requires acquired intangible
assets to be separately recognized if the benefit of                    17 the intangible assets is obtained through contractual or other legal right, or
if the intangible assets can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented or
exchanged.
As of December 31, 2002, we had unamortized goodwill in the amount of
approximately $30 million, and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in
the amount of approximately $14 million, all of which were subject to the
transition provisions of SFAS 141 and SFAS 142. The Company did not record an
amortization of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2002. Goodwill was
tested for impairment during the first quarter of fiscal 2002. The fair value of
the Alpha business, which was acquired during the second quarter of fiscal 2001
and from which the goodwill arose, was estimated using the expected present
value of future cash flows. See Overview - Acquisition of Alpha Microsystems,
above. We consider that there was no impairment in the carrying value of
goodwill. Amortization expense related to goodwill was $142,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2001.
Financial Condition
Our cash and short-term investment portfolio amounted to $85,762,000 as at
December 31, 2002, compared to $104,104,000 as at December 31, 2001. The
decrease relates primarily to the following: cash used in operations of
$5,929,000, the repurchase of common shares by our company of $8,684,000, the
purchase of property and equipment of $3,084,000 and patent costs of $645,000.
Our portfolio of short-term investments consists of short-term discounted notes
with a weighted average effective yield of 156%. Our investments are liquid and
investment grade. The portfolio is invested in U.S. and Canadian dollar
denominated securities, which are short-term to minimize interest rate risk.
Our inventory position at year-end was $22,657,000, increased from
$22,355,000 at the end of 2001. The year-end inventory position included
$1,648,000 of finished goods and $356,000 of work in process, compared to
$2,779,000 of finished goods and $542,000 of work in process at the end of 2001.
In addition, included in the inventory were raw materials and replacement parts
amounting to $4,469,000 and $16,185,000, respectively, for 2002 and $6,970,000
and $12,065,000, respectively, for 2001. The replacement parts inventory
increased in order to service additional systems sold during the year and to
support our U-Scan1, U-Scan3 and U-Scan5 next generation systems. We believe,
considering our current installed base and our anticipated sales for 2003, that
this level of replacement parts is appropriate for the current servicing and
support of our customers.
We have no long-term debt. Shareholders' equity as at December 31, 2002 was
$119,461,000 as compared to $133,473,000 as at December 31, 2001.
We will continue to evaluate areas in which to invest further, such as
sales, marketing and product support infrastructure. We will continue to
increase our research and development spending on new technologies.
Share Repurchase Program
Pursuant to a 12-month share repurchase program which terminated on March
4, 2003, we repurchased 535,100 of our common shares for total consideration of
$8,684,330. See note 10 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements,
which are included in Item 8- Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Quarterly Results
The following table sets forth certain summarized unaudited quarterly
financial data for the periods presented. The financial data has been derived
from unaudited financial statements that, in the opinion of management, reflect
all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for
a fair presentation of such quarterly data. The operating results for any
quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any
future period.
The unaudited financial statements are prepared on the basis of Canadian
GAAP, which is different in some regards from U.S. GAAP. For a description of
the material differences between Canadian GAAP and U.S. GAAP in regard to our
consolidated financial statements, see note 20 of the notes to our consolidated
financial statements, which are included in Item 8--Financial Statements and

Results of Operations
2002 Compared with 2001
Total revenues decreased by $25,703,000, or 25%, from 2001 to 2002. Sales
of our U-Scan systems declined by $31,220,000, or 34%, from 2001 to 2002. The
decline in sales was due to a significant decrease in orders from existing
customers compounded by reluctance of major retailers to spend on capital, as a
result of the continued economic weakness throughout North America. Service
contract revenue recognized for hardware and software maintenance increased by
$5,517,000, or 55%, from 2001 to 2002, in part because of the increased number
of customers that entered into service contracts with us after purchasing U-Scan
systems. In total, service revenue accounted for approximately 21% of our total
revenues in 2002 as compared to approximately 99% in 2001.
Cost of sales decreased by $12,897,000, or 20%, from 2001 to 2002. Overall
gross margin decreased as a percentage of sales from 38% in 2001 to 34% in 2002,
primarily due to the increased percentage of service contract revenue in 2002
compared to 2001, which generated a lower gross margin compared to the gross
margin generated by system sales.
Gross research and development expenses increased by $122,000, or 6%, from
2001 to 2002. As a percentage of total revenues, gross research and development
expenses increased from 2% in 2001 to 3% in 2002. Research and development
expenses during the year included the continuing development costs of the U-Scan
Mobile AttendantTM device; the integration of an electronic signature capture
interface and process; the integration of a biometric access interface and
process; a lower profile, smaller footprint U-Scan system; and the improvement
of the graphical user interface GUI.                    19   During the fourth quarter of 2002, we closed our assembly facility in
Phoenix, Arizona and a support hub in Covington, Kentucky, in an effort to
consolidate operations. The costs incurred as a result of these closures, in the
approximate amount of $1,039,000, related mainly to lease costs, severance
costs, and the write down of inventories and leasehold improvements. As at
December 31, 2002, a provision of $288,000 relating to future lease obligations
is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheet. We expect these closures to produce an annualized cost savings of
approximately $14 million.
Selling, general, administrative and other expenses including operating
lease expenses increased by $11,932,108, or 56%, from 2001 to 2002. As a
percentage of total revenues, these expenses increased from 19% to 40%. The
increase in selling, general, administrative and other expenses in 2002 was
primarily due to the hiring of additional sales and business development people;
expansion of our service organization as a result of our increased number of
system installations; the cost of hiring and training service technicians as a
result of the termination of third party support providers; the design of our
U-Scan1, U-Scan2 and U-Scan3 next generation of systems, along with the training
of our technicians and customers for these systems; marketing and trade show
expenses; and the establishment of Optimal Robotics Plc, our U.K. subsidiary.
Other expenses incurred include the migration and upgrade of our computer
systems as well as the standardization of software for a major customer in order
to consolidate the number of versions required to run its self-checkout systems.
The recovery of income taxes amounted to $2,941,000 in 2002 as compared to
a tax provision of $9,600,000 in 2001. The 2002 amount included the recovery of
tax from losses carried back to prior years, as well as the future benefit of
the remaining non-capital losses carry forward, undeducted research and
development expenditures and other temporary differences that may be used to
reduce taxable income for Canadian federal and Quebec provincial income tax
purposes in future years. With respect to the future income tax assets recorded
as at December 31, 2002, we determined that it is more likely than not that we
will earn sufficient taxable income during the allowable carry-forward period to
fully realize all of our future income tax assets. Our ability to ultimately
realize these future income tax assets is dependent upon our realizing certain
sales levels within the allowable carry-forward period, thus creating sufficient
taxable income to realize the benefit of these assets. Our ability to realize
these assets is also dependent on effective control over our selling, general
and administrative expenses.
Our effective tax rate for 2002 was 35%, as compared to 51% for 2001. In
2001, we recognized Canadian income taxes on foreign exchange gains in the
amount of approximately $22 million. Because our consolidated financial
statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the foreign exchange gains, which for
Canadian income tax purposes arise on the conversion into Canadian dollars of
our net monetary assets denominated in U.S. dollars, create a tax liability even
though foreign exchange gains do not impact our earnings before income taxes.
Excluding the effect of Canadian income taxes on these foreign exchange gains,
the effective tax rate in 2001 would have been 39%, instead of 51%. In 2002, we
recognized a tax recovery of $178,000 on these foreign exchange items.
The net loss in 2002 was $5,327,000 or $035 per share diluted,
compared to net earnings of $9,306,000 in 2001 or $060 per share diluted.
As a measure of our financial performance, management uses supplementary net
earnings/loss of operating performance. Supplementary net loss earnings
exclude the effect of future income taxes on unrealized foreign exchange
gains/losses, as discussed in note 16 of the notes to our consolidated financial
statements, which are included in Item 8--Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data. Excluding the future income taxes on foreign exchange
gains, supplementary measure of net loss earnings was $5,505,000 for 2002,
compared to $11,479,000 for 2001. On a per-share basis, the supplementary
measure of net earnings was $037 basic and diluted for 2002, as compared to
$078 basic and $074 diluted for 2001.
2001 Compared with 2000
Total revenues increased by $40,451,000, or 66%, from 2000 to 2001. Sales
of our U-Scan systems produced $33,512,000 of additional systems revenues, an
increase of 58%. The growth in sales was due to a significant increase in orders
from existing customers as well as new customers. Service contract revenue
recognized for hardware and software maintenance increased by $6,682,000, or
198%, in part because of the increased number of customers that entered into
service contracts with us after purchasing U-Scan systems and in part due to our
decision in the third quarter of 2001 to service an increased number of
maintenance contracts                    20 using our own technicians rather than third party support providers. In total,
service revenue accounted for approximately 99% of our total revenues in 2001
compared to approximately 55% in 2000.
Cost of sales increased by $17,601,000, or 39%, from 2000 to 2001. Overall
gross margin increased as a percentage of sales from 25% in 2000 to 38% in 2001,
primarily due to the increase in gross margin on system sales. This margin
increase resulted primarily from the fact that commencing January 1, 2001 we
began to assemble all of our U-Scan systems.
Gross research and development expenses increased by $966,000, or 91%, from
2000 to 2001. As a percentage of total revenues, gross research and development
expenses remained constant at 2% for both 2000 and 2001. Research and
development expenses during the year included the cost of the U-Scan Mobile
Attendant device; the development of an electronic signature capture interface
and process; a paging feature; a lower profile, smaller footprint U-Scan system;
and the improvement of the graphical user interface GUI.
Selling, general, administrative and other expenses including operating
lease expenses increased by $10,651,000, or 100%, in 2001 compared to 2000. As
a percentage of total revenues, these expenses increased from 16% to 19%. The
increase in selling, general, administrative and other expenses in 2001 was
primarily due to increased investment in sales and marketing, support and
administrative staff required to service the increased customer base and
strategic acquisitions.
The provision for income taxes amounted to $9,600,000 in 2001 as compared
to $2,972,000 in 2000. We utilized all unclaimed scientific research and
experimental development expenditures and federal investment tax credits carried
forward to reduce our cash taxes payable for 2001.
Our effective tax rate for 2001 was 51% as compared to 38% for 2000. The
increase was due to Canadian income taxes recognized on foreign exchange gains
in the amount of approximately $22 million. Because our consolidated financial
statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the foreign exchange gains which, for
Canadian income tax purposes, arise on the conversion into Canadian dollars of
our net monetary assets denominated in U.S. dollars create a tax liability even
though foreign exchange gains do not impact our earnings before income taxes.
Excluding the effect of Canadian income taxes on these foreign exchange gains,
the effective tax rate in 2001 would have been 39%, instead of 51%.
Net earnings in 2001 were $9,306,000 or $060 per share diluted,
compared to $4,795,000 in 2000 or $033 per share diluted, an increase of
94%. As a measure of our financial performance, management uses supplementary
net earnings as a measure of operating performance. Supplementary net earnings
exclude the effect of future income taxes on unrealized foreign exchange gains,
as discussed in note 16 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements,
which are included in Item 8--Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Excluding the income taxes on the foreign exchange gains, supplementary measure
of net earnings is $11,479,000 for 2001, an increase of 139% from $4,795,000 for
2000. On a per-share basis, the supplementary measure of net earnings is $078
basic and $074 diluted for 2001, as compared to $037 basic and $033
diluted for 2000.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2002, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments of $85,762,000, compared to $104,104,000 as of December 31, 2001,
and working capital of $108,650,000, compared to $124,550,000 as of December 31,
2001.
Operating activities used $5,929,000 of cash and cash equivalents in 2002,
as compared to having generated $13,678,000 in 2001. In 2002, the Company
repurchased 535,100 common shares for a total amount of $8,684,000. In 2001, we
issued 1,762,645 common shares pursuant to the exercise of options and warrants,
which resulted in net cash proceeds of $19,421,000.
In 2002, we had capital expenditures of $3,084,000, which principally
related to computer equipment, testing units and leasehold improvements related
to the expansion of our facility in Santa Ana, California.                    21   We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will
be adequate to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months.
We have no financial obligations of significance other than long-term lease
commitments for our premises in the United States and Canada. These are
summarized in note 12a of the notes to our consolidated financial statements,
which are included in Item 8--Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
The timing of our contractual commitments during the next five years,
related to our operating leases, is as follows

-       Forward-Looking Statements
This Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be
covered by the safe harbors created thereby. Words such as expects, intends,
anticipates, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, or variations of such
words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking
statements. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve
risk and uncertainty. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the
forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the
assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore, there can be no assurance that
the forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K will prove to be
accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the
forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information
should not be regarded as a representation of our company or any other person
that the objectives and plans of our company will be achieved.
The following factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the
general or specific factors that may affect us. It should be recognized that
other factors, including general economic factors and business strategies, may
be significant, presently or in the future, and the factors discussed below may
affect us to a greater extent than indicated. All forward-looking statements
attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in
their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth herein. Except as required
by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
WE PRINCIPALLY DEPEND ON ONE LINE OF PRODUCTS. Our short-term success
depends principally on the sales volume of one line of products, the U-Scan
self-checkout system. Our longer-term success depends upon the continued
acceptance of and demand for this one product line, as well as new products that
we may bring to market. If the U-Scan systems experience significant problems,
competition from superior technology, or customer resistance, we could be harmed
significantly.
Sales growth will depend on our generating additional orders from existing
U-Scan system customers, as well as finding new customers for the system. We
believe that our customers will only purchase the system if they conclude that
shoppers will use it and that there are financial benefits to their stores from
its installation. We believe that shoppers will use the system only if it is
convenient, easy to use and reliable.
WE RELIED ON ONE CUSTOMER FOR A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF OUR REVENUES IN 2002.
One significant customer, through its various divisions and affiliates,
accounted for approximately 44% of our revenues in 2002, and we rely on this
customer continued willingness to purchase our U-Scan systems. We may not be
able to generate new customers for our U-Scan systems.
WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MANAGE OUR GROWTH. Prior to 2002, we experienced
significant growth in sales. As a result, we had to hire and train additional
skilled personnel. Due to the continued economic weakness throughout North
America, in February 2003 we reduced our workforce by approximately 12%. Should
sales increase, we will again have to hire and train more personnel to
customize, install and
22 support our U-Scan systems. There is no assurance that we will be able to hire
the skilled personnel we will need to meet increased demand, should it develop.
If we are unable to hire such personnel, our sales may be adversely affected.
Despite the growth that we experienced prior to 2002, we are still a small
company, and should demand for our products be unexpectedly strong, we may be
unable to fill our orders.
WE RELY ON THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS. The U-Scan system is assembled from
components that are readily available from numerous suppliers. Although we may
use a single supplier for particular components, given the open architecture of
our system, we are not dependent on any single supplier for any particular
component. Nevertheless, should any of our suppliers fail to deliver components
to us in a timely manner, it could disrupt our business.
OUR U-SCAN SYSTEMS ARE ASSEMBLED AT A SINGLE FACILITY. We assemble our
systems at our facility in Plattsburgh, New York. A disruption of operations at
this facility for any reason, including labor unrest or natural disaster, would
have a short-term adverse effect upon our business and results of operations.
WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY. The
self-checkout industry is rapidly developing. The technology used by the U-Scan
system is changing rapidly, in part due to the evolving demands of our
customers. To be successful, we will have to anticipate the demands of our
customers and improve our existing product line and develop new products to
satisfy them. If we fail to improve and develop products by the times and at the
prices demanded by our customers, our business and prospects may be adversely
affected. Our competitors may introduce new technology that is better than ours.
If so, we will have to improve our technology in order to remain competitive. If
we are unable to do so, there might be an adverse impact on us.
WE DEPEND UPON KEY PERSONNEL. Our future success depends to a great extent
on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel,
including sales and business development people. Our success will also depend
upon our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel to assemble, install and
support our systems, to improve our existing products and to develop new ones.
These people will include   o programmers and other software engineers   o project managers   o installers, and
o hardware and software support personnel.
The competition for these people may be significant, despite current
economic conditions. Should we have difficulty hiring or retaining qualified
personnel, it could adversely affect our business and prospects.
COMPETITION COULD REDUCE REVENUE FROM THE U-SCAN SYSTEM. The market for
checkout systems is very competitive. The chief rival for our U-Scan system is
the traditional manned checkout counter. Although the use of automated
self-checkout systems such as the U-Scan system is relatively new, we expect
increasing competition for sales of this product. The barriers to entering this
market may be low. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater
financial and other resources. Competitors include NCR, Symbol Technologies, PSC
and Productivity Solutions. We may not be able to compete successfully against
these and other companies with greater financial and other resources. In the
event that general economic conditions continue to result in reduced demand in
our industry, our competitors could develop more aggressive pricing practices,
which, in turn, could result in price reductions, negatively affecting our
operating results, reducing our profit margins and potentially leading to a loss
of market share.
OUR PRODUCTS MAY CONTAIN DEFECTS. Our products, including the U-Scan
system, are complex and, despite extensive testing, may contain undetected flaws
when first installed for a new customer. This is particularly true of the
software in the U-Scan system, which must be adapted to each customer
information systems. If serious, any such flaws could prevent or delay market
acceptance of our products and cause us to incur substantial re-engineering
expenses.
THE ADVERSE RESOLUTION OF LITIGATION AGAINST US COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR
BUSINESS. We are currently a defendant in an action alleging that the U-Scan
system infringes upon the
23 claimant patent, and a second party has sent demand letters to us alleging a
different patent infringement. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings. We are and may
in the future be subject to other litigation arising in the normal course of our
business. Litigation may be time consuming, expensive and distracting from the
conduct of our business, and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict.
The adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
ORGANIZED LABOR MAY RESIST OUR U-SCAN SYSTEMS. The U-Scan system displaces
cashiers. For this reason, organized labor may seek provisions in collective
bargaining agreements that prevent stores from purchasing the system.
WE MAY BE VULNERABLE TO TECHNOLOGICAL PROBLEMS. We are a
technology-oriented company and depend to a significant degree upon our ability
to communicate on-line or by telephone with the systems that we have sold. If we
are unable to access these systems due to technological problems beyond our
control, it will have a material adverse effect on our ability to assist our
customers. Additionally, if our customers are unable to reach us by telephone or
via the Internet, we will also be unable to respond to questions or address
serious problems faced by these customers. If our ability to communicate with
our systems or our customers is impaired, our business may be adversely
affected. The Internet is subject to security and privacy breaches, which may
impact us or our customers.
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA, AFFECTING THE SELF-CHECKOUT
INDUSTRY, ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL AND MAY RESULT IN CONTINUING REDUCED DEMAND AND
PRICING PRESSURE ON OUR PRODUCTS. There are trends and factors affecting the
self-checkout industry, which are beyond our control and may affect our
operations. Such trends and factors include   o adverse changes in the public and private equity and debt markets and
the ability of our customers to obtain financing or to fund capital
expenditures   o visibility to, and the actual size and timing of, capital expenditures
by our customers   o the effects of war or acts of terrorism.
Reduced capital spending and the generally negative economic conditions in
the United States and Canada have resulted in substantially reduced demand for
our products. Continuing negative economic conditions could result in further
reductions in demand for and/or pricing pressures on our products. Reduced
capital spending and/or negative economic conditions in Europe can be expected
to affect our attempt to initiate sales of our systems in Europe.                    24 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Approximately 19%
of our expenses are paid in Canadian dollars, while substantially all of our
revenues are earned in U.S. dollars. If the Canadian dollar strengthens in
relation to the U.S. dollar, the effective cost of our expenses as reported in
U.S. dollars will increase. We have never tried to hedge our exchange rate
risk, do not plan to do so and may not be successful should we attempt to do so
in the future. We are also exposed to interest rate fluctuation risk, which we
do not systematically manage. We presently invest in short-term investment grade
paper.                    25 Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA                    26 AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS

b Cash and cash equivalents     Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and balances with
banks and highly liquid debt instruments with original terms to
maturity of three months or less.
c Short-term investments     Short-term investments, which management intends to hold until
maturity, include investments with maturities of greater than three
months and less than a year and are carried at the lower of amortized
cost and market value.
d Securitizations     Securitization transactions are recorded as sales of assets when the
control of the asset is transferred to the purchaser. Transactions
recorded in this manner result in the removal of the assets sold from
the Company balance sheet. Discount fees on the portfolio of
receivables sold are recorded in selling, general and administrative
expenses.                    33 Optimal Robotics Corp.

2.  Significant accounting policies continued   e Inventories     Raw material inventories are stated at the lower of landed cost or
replacement cost. Finished goods and work in process inventories are
stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined
on the basis of weighted average cost.
In order to provide maintenance and repair services to its customers,
the Company is required to maintain significant levels of replacement
parts. Parts are stated at cost, less an allowance for obsolescence and
shrinkage. The costs of refurbishing parts are included in the cost of
sales as incurred.
Periodic revisions to allowance estimates are required, based upon the
evaluation of several factors, including changes in estimated product
life cycles, usage levels, and technology changes. Changes in these
estimates are reflected immediately in income.
f Research and investment tax credits     Research and investment tax credits are recorded as a reduction of the
related expense or the cost of the assets acquired. Tax credits are
recorded in the accounts when reasonable assurance exists that they
will be realized.
g Property and equipment     Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Amortization is provided
for over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the
straight-line method at the following annual rates      
Test units                             33%

The Company performs reviews for the impairment of its property and
equipment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be
recognized when estimates of non-discounted future cash flows expected
to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition are
less than the carrying amount. No impairment losses have been
identified by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001
and 2000.                    34 Optimal Robotics Corp.

2.  Significant accounting policies continued   h Goodwill and other intangible assets     Goodwill:
Goodwill is the residual amount that results when the purchase price of
an acquired business exceeds the sum of the amounts allocated to the
assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, based on their fair values.
Goodwill is allocated as of the date of the business combination to the
Company reporting units that are expected to benefit from the
synergies of the business combination.
Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the new recommendations
of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants CICA, Handbook
Section 3062, with respect to the accounting for goodwill and other
intangible assets. The standard changes the accounting for goodwill
from an amortization method to an impairment-only approach. The change
was accounted for prospectively. The Company did not record
amortization of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2002. Goodwill
was tested for impairment during the first quarter of fiscal 2002. The
fair value of the Alpha Microsystems business, which was acquired
during the second quarter of fiscal 2001 and from which the goodwill
arose, was estimated using the expected present value of future cash
flows. Management considered that there was no impairment in the
carrying value of goodwill.
As required under CICA Handbook Section 3062, the following information
is presented      
Year ended December 31,

2.  Significant accounting policies continued   h Goodwill and other intangible assets continued     Other intangible assets:
Intangible assets acquired either individually or with a group of other
assets are initially recognized and measured at cost. The cost of a
group of intangible assets, including those acquired in a business
combination that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from
goodwill, is allocated to the individual assets based on their relative
fair values. The new standard requires acquired intangible assets to be
separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible assets is
obtained through contractual or other legal right, or if the intangible
assets can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged.
There has been no change in the estimated useful life of the other
intangible assets which continue to be amortized using the
straight-line method at the following annual rates      
Customer list                            20%
Patent costs                      over patent life
i Income taxes     The Company provides for income taxes using the asset and liability
method of tax allocation. Under this method, future income tax assets
and liabilities are determined based on deductible or taxable temporary
differences between financial statement values and tax values of assets
and liabilities using enacted income tax rates expected to be in effect
for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
The Company establishes a valuation allowance against future income tax
assets if, based on available information, it is more likely than not
that some or all of the future income tax assets will not be realized.
j Revenue recognition     Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment, delivery or
upon customer acceptance of the product, based upon the terms as
defined in the customer contract. Installation service revenue, which
is billed separately from product sales, is recognized at the time the
service has been provided to the customers. Revenue from maintenance,
which is subject to separate contracts, is deferred and amortized
ratably over the term of the contract.                    36 Optimal Robotics Corp.

2.  Significant accounting policies continued   k Foreign currency translation     Effective July 1, 2000, the Company adopted the United States dollar as
its measurement currency as a result of the significance of business
activities conducted in the United States and the increasing proportion
of operating, financing and investing transactions in the Canadian
operations that are denominated in U.S. dollars.
Monetary assets and liabilities of the Canadian and foreign operations
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated at
the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet dates. Other
assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar are translated at the exchange rates prevailing when the assets
were acquired or the liabilities incurred. Revenues and expenses
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated at
the approximate rate of exchange in effect on the date of the
transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the
determination of net earnings.
Prior to July 1, 2000, the Company measurement currency was the
Canadian dollar. However, the Company had adopted the U.S. dollar as
its reporting currency effective December 31, 1998. Accordingly, the
financial statements from December 31, 1998 to June 30, 2000 have been
translated from Canadian dollars into U.S. dollars using the current
rate method. Gains and losses resulting from translation of the
financial statements were included in the cumulative translation
adjustment in shareholders' equity. As a result of the change in the
measurement currency to U.S. dollars adopted in 2000, the cumulative
translation account will not change.
Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted retroactively the
revisions to CICA Handbook Section 1650 Foreign Currency Translation.
The new recommendations eliminate the deferral and amortization of
unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses on foreign
currency denominated monetary items that have a fixed or ascertainable
life extending beyond the end of the fiscal year following the current
reporting period. There is no impact on the Company consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows as a result of
adopting these recommendations. The new recommendations also require
the disclosure of foreign exchange gains losses included in the
consolidated statements of earnings which, for 2002, amounted to $6,436
2001 - $90,110; 2000 - $1,507,340.
l Research and development expenses     Research costs, which include all costs incurred to establish
technological feasibility, are charged to operations in the year in
which they are incurred. Technological feasibility has been defined as
the completion of the product design for the computer software.                    37 Optimal Robotics Corp.

are evaluated for deferral and subsequent amortization. As at December
31, 2002, the Company has not deferred any development costs.
m Stock-based compensation     Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted prospectively the new
recommendations of the CICA, Handbook Section 3870, with respect to the
accounting for stock-based compensation and other stock-based payments.
The new recommendations require that all stock-based payments to
non-employees, and employee awards that are direct awards of stock,
call for settlement in cash or other assets, or are stock appreciation
rights that call for settlement by the issuance of equity instruments,
granted on or after January 1, 2002 be accounted for using the fair
value method. For all other stock-based employee compensation awards,
the new standards permit the Company to continue to follow its existing
policy of using the settlement date method of accounting. Under this
method, no compensation expense is recognized when stock options are
issued to employees. Any consideration received from the plan
participants upon exercise of stock options is credited to share
capital.                    38 Optimal Robotics Corp.

Management believes that the effects of applying Handbook Section 3870
on a pro forma basis are not likely to be representative of the effects
on reported pro forma net earnings for future years as the estimated
compensation costs reflect only options granted between January 1, 2002
and December 31, 2002 and do not consider awards which may occur in
future years, the terms and conditions of which may vary.
Dividend yield was excluded from the calculation since it is the
present policy of the Company to retain all earnings to finance
operations. In addition, option valuation models require the input of
highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect their
fair value estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do
not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of
its stock options.
n Earnings per share     Basic earnings per share are determined using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings
per share are calculated using the treasury stock method. Diluted
earnings per share are computed in a manner consistent with basic
earnings per share except that the weighted average shares outstanding
are increased to include additional shares from the assumed exercise of
options and warrants, if dilutive. The number of additional shares is
calculated by assuming that outstanding options and warrants were
exercised and that the proceeds from such exercises are used to
repurchase common shares at the average market price during the
reporting period.                    40 Optimal Robotics Corp.

reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

common shares. Options may be granted by the Board of Directors for
terms of up to ten years. The Board of Directors establishes the
exercise period, vesting terms and other conditions for each grant at
the grant date. Options may be granted with exercise prices at the then
current market price. Options outstanding under the plan expire between
five and ten years after the date of grant and vest either immediately
or over a period of up to two years.
Upon its establishment in 1997, 3,000,000 common shares were authorized
for issuance pursuant to options granted under the stock option plan.
During 2000, there was a 3,000,000-share increase in the number of
common shares that may be issued under this plan. During 2001, there
was a further 3,000,000-share increase in the number of common shares
that may be issued under this plan. As at December 31, 2002, 2,543,725
common shares had been issued pursuant to the stock option plan, an
additional 4,794,525 common shares were reserved for options
outstanding, leaving a further 1,661,750 common shares available to be
granted under this plan.
b Options granted under employment agreements     The Company had granted options under the plan pursuant to certain
employment agreements which provide that in the event of termination by
the Company without cause, the exercise price of all options, warrants
or rights would be amended to a nominal value. At December 31, 2002,
options to purchase 2,790,000 2001 - 2,097,000 common shares with a
weighted average exercise price of $2322 2001 - $2906 were subject
to this provision, of which 2,392,500 2001 - 927,000 options were
exercisable.                    46 Optimal Robotics Corp.

11. Stock option plan/warrants continued   c Options subject to reload provision     In 1997, options to purchase 312,000 common shares were granted,
including 282,000 which were granted to three senior officers with a
reload feature whereby upon exercise of the option, a new option is
issued with an exercise price equal to the then current market price.
Two consecutive reloads were permitted. The holder was permitted to
exercise the options without paying cash by accepting the number of
shares having a value equal to the in-the-money value of the options.
This right was irrevocably waived by the holders of options to acquire
307,000 common shares in 1998 and the options for the remaining 5,000
expired in the same year.
During 2001, 289,000 2000 - 20,000 of these options were exercised
and immediately reloaded at the then current market price. During,
2002, there were no options with a reload provision exercised and the
remaining 307,000 options granted, which were subject to this reload
provision, expired.

certain office equipment. The minimum amounts payable for each of the
next five years, excluding the Company proportionate share of common
operating costs, are approximately as follows      
2003                           $  1,084,000
2004                             1,023,000

b In 1995 and 1996, the Company received demand letters from the same
claimant alleging patent infringement. In July 1999, the claimant filed
a civil action alleging patent infringement in the United States
District Court for the District of Utah against the Company and PSC
Inc., one of the Company suppliers. In addition, a similar suit has
been filed in the State of Utah against one of the Company customers.
The Company is contractually bound to indemnify the customer for any
damages it incurs in connection with such suit. At the Company
expense, the Company legal counsel is defending this suit. The
Company also received a lawyer letter from another party in 1999, and
again in February 2001, alleging infringement of another patent.
No amounts have been specified in these claims. Consequently, it is not
possible at this time to make an estimate of the amount of damages, if
any, that may result and accordingly, no provision has been made in
these financial statements with respect to the above claims. The
Company believes these claims to be without merit and intends to
vigorously defend its position.
c The Company is party to litigation arising in the normal course of
operations. The Company does not expect the resolution of such matters
to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position or
results of operations of the Company.                    50 Optimal Robotics Corp.

14. Closure costs   The Company closed the assembly facility in Phoenix, Arizona, and the
support hub in Covington, Kentucky in an effort to consolidate operations.
The costs incurred as a result of the closures related mainly to lease
costs, severance payments and the write-down of inventories and leasehold
improvements. As at December 31, 2002, a provision of approximately
$288,000 relating to future obligations under leased premises is included
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance
sheets. 15. Income taxes   The income tax provision differs from the amount computed by applying the
combined Canadian federal and Quebec tax rates to earnings before income
taxes. The reasons for the difference and the related tax effects are as

15. Income taxes continued   1 For purposes of calculating the income tax provision of the Company, a
tax liability is recognized on the foreign exchange gains which arise
on the conversion into Canadian dollars of the net monetary assets
denominated in U.S. dollars which is required for tax purposes. Because
these financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, this foreign
exchange gain does not impact earnings before income taxes even though
the income tax provision includes a tax liability for this gain. Future
fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate between the Canadian and U.S.
dollar will change the amount of the foreign exchange gains and thus
the provision for income taxes thereon.
The recovery of provision for income taxes is composed of the following

15. Income taxes continued   Management believes that it is more likely than not that all future income
tax assets will be realized and, accordingly, no valuation allowance is
required.
The Company has approximately $3,200,000 of losses carryforward available
to reduce federal taxable income in the United States. These losses expire
in 2022. 16. Earnings per share   Supplementary measures of earnings do not have any standardized meaning
prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles and are therefore
unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.
The purpose of presenting a supplementary measure of net earnings and
earnings per share is to illustrate the tax impact of the foreign exchange
gain which arises on the conversion of the short-term investments into
Canadian dollars for purposes of determining taxable income under Canadian
income tax regulations as described in note 15.

18. Financial instruments   a Credit risk     Credit risk results from the possibility that a loss may occur from the
failure of another party to perform according to the terms of the
contract. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, short-term
investments and accounts receivable. Cash is maintained with a
high-credit quality financial institution. Short-term investments
consist of short-term discounted notes issued by high-credit quality
corporations. For accounts receivable, the Company performs periodic
credit evaluations and typically does not require collateral.
Allowances are maintained for potential credit losses consistent with
the credit risk, historical trends, general economic conditions and
other information.
b Interest rate risk     The Company exposure to interest rate risk is as follows      
Cash and cash equivalents              Fixed interest rate

18. Financial instruments continued   c Fair value     Fair value estimates are made as of a specific point in time using
available information about the financial instrument. These estimates
are subjective in nature and often cannot be determined with precision.
The Company has determined that the carrying values of cash, accounts
receivable, tax credits receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values due to the
relatively short periods to maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of short-term investments as at December 31, 2002
amounted to approximately $76,713,851 2001 - $94,635,000 which was
calculated by reference to various market data. 19. Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123,
the Company has chosen to use the intrinsic value method which
requires compensation costs to be recognized on the difference, if
any, between the quoted market price of the stock as at the grant
date and the amount the individual must pay to acquire the stock.
Certain of the Company stock options are variable because the
exercise price is not known until the options are exercised. As a
result, compensation cost is measured on the date the options are
exercised.                    57 Optimal Robotics Corp.

Management believes that the effects of applying SFAS No. 123 on a pro
forma basis are not likely to be representative of the effects on reported
pro forma net earnings for future years as the estimated compensation
costs reflect only options granted to December 31, 2002 and do not
consider awards which may occur in future years, the terms and conditions
of which may vary.
Dividend yield was excluded from the calculation since it is the present
policy of the Company to retain all earnings to finance operations. In
addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because the
Company stock options have characteristics significantly different from
those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect their fair value estimate, in
management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a
reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock options.                    60 Optimal Robotics Corp.

currency, the historical financial statements were presented using
a translation of convenience. Under U.S. GAAP, the financial

Comprehensive income consists of net earnings loss and all other
changes in shareholders' equity that do not result from transactions
with shareholders. These changes include cumulative foreign currency
translation adjustments. The statement requires only additional

period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets. This statement is effective
for the Company fiscal year beginning January 1, 2003. The Company
does not expect SFAS No. 143 to have a material impact on its financial
statements.
In April 2002, FASB issued SFAS No 145, Rescission of FASB Statements
No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical
Corrections. In June 2002, FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for

1, 2003. The Company does not expect SFAS No. 145 and 146 to have a
