balance sheets of P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc. the
Company as of December31, 2000 and
December30, 2001, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, common stockholders equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
December30, 2001. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of P.F. Changs China
Bistro, Inc. at December31, 2000 and December30,
2001 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for

STATEMENTS December31, 2000 and December30,
2001 1.Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies Organization
and Nature of Operations P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc. the
Company operates two restaurant concepts in a
single segment consisting of restaurants throughout the United
States under the name of P.F.Changs China
Bistro and Pei Wei Asian Diner. The Company
successfully completed an initial public offering the
Offering on December9, 1998, in which
3,922,500 new shares of common stock were issued at a price of
$12 per share. Proceeds from the offering were $42,675,100, net
of issuance costs totaling $4,394,900. Upon completion of the Offering, all outstanding
shares of preferred stock were converted to shares of common
stock at a ratio of one share of common stock for each two
shares of preferred stock. Additionally, the deferred purchase
price liability, resulting from the Companys acquisition
of substantially all of the remaining minority interests in the
three original restaurants in 1997, was converted into common
stock. The number of shares issued relating to the deferred
purchase price liability was determined by dividing the
remaining purchase price liability by the price per share of the
common stock sold. Fiscal
Year The Companys fiscal year ends on the Sunday
closest to the end of December and includes 52weeks in
2000 and 2001 and 53weeks in 1999. Use of
Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Principles of
Consolidation The Companys consolidated financial
statements include the accounts and operations of the Company
and its subsidiaries and partnerships in which it owns more than
a 50percent interest. All material balances and
transactions between the consolidated entities have been
eliminated. Cash and Cash
Equivalents The Companys cash balances are not pledged
or restricted. The Companys policy is to invest cash in
excess of operating requirements in income-producing
investments. Income-producing investments with maturities of
three months or less at the time of investment are reflected as
cash equivalents. Cash equivalents at December30, 2001
consist primarily of money market funds. 36 Table of Contents P.F. CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Investments The Company accounts for investments in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standard No115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities. The Companys investments are classified
as available for sale. At December30, 2001 133million, recorded as Short-term Investments,
consisted of preferred stock investments in Dividends Received
Eligible Auction Market Stock DREAMS offered under private
placements by a subsidiary of Bank of America. Under the terms
of the investment arrangement, the Company participates in
periodic auctions that are generally held every 49days and
that determine the dividend rate. The Company has the
opportunity to offer to sell its investment during such periodic
auctions subject to availability of buying bidders. The Company
may also sell the investment to certain accredited investors.
Under the prospectus it is the intention to maintain a rating
for the DREAMS at a grade of AAA by Moodys. At
December30, 2001, the Company also had a $17million
investment, recorded in Other Assets, in a municipal bond
maturing in 2031. Both instruments have a cost which equals fair
market value at December30, 2001. Receivables Receivables consist primarily of amounts due from
landlords or other parties for the reimbursement of leasehold
improvements paid by the Company. Inventories Inventories consist of food and beverages and are
stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in,
first-out method. Notes
Receivable From Related Parties Notes receivable from related parties represent
amounts due the Company from employees, none of which are
officers, directors or affiliates of the Company. A significant
portion of these amounts is due from an employee of Pei Wei
Asian Diner, Inc. All notes receivable outstanding as of
December30, 2001 will become due within the next two years. Property and
Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, which
includes capitalized interest during the construction and
development period. Furniture, fixtures and equipment are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
service lives of the related assets, which approximates seven
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of
the useful life of the asset or the length of the related lease
term. China and smallwares are depreciated over two years up to
50percent of their original cost, and subsequent additions
are expensed as purchased. During the years ended
January2, 2000, December31, 2000 and
December30, 2001, the Company capitalized $0, $533,000 and
$77,000, respectively, of interest costs. The Company follows Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFASNo. 121, Accounting for
the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets To
Be Disposed Of, which requires impairment losses to be
recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators
of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flow
estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the
assets carrying amount. The Companys policy is to
evaluate long-lived assets for impairment at a store level. Intangibles Intangibles consist primarily of goodwill
relating to the excess of cost over net assets acquired in the
purchase of interests in various restaurants at the formation of
the Company and the subsequent acquisition of certain minority
partnership interests in the operating rights of certain of the
Companys partnerships and/or 37 Table of Contents P.F. CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued operating restaurants. The initial goodwill was
recorded at $87million and the subsequently-acquired
interests in partnerships and/or operating restaurants is
$21million. Intangibles are amortized over 20years
on a straight-line basis. In accordance with the provisions of
SFAS 142, the Company will apply the new rules on accounting for
goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first
quarter of 2002. Also during 2002, the Company will perform the
required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived
intangible assets. The Company currently anticipates that its
goodwill will no longer be amortized under SFAS 142 but will be
subjected to periodic impairment assessments as defined in that
Standard. The Company is currently assessing the treatment of
the subsequently-acquired minority interests in partnerships
and/or operating restaurants. Unearned
Revenue Unearned revenue represents gift certificates
sold but not yet redeemed. Revenues are recognized upon
redemption of the gift certificates. Revenue
Recognition Revenues from food, beverage and alcohol sales
are recognized as products are sold. Advertising The Company expenses advertising as incurred.
Advertising expense for the years ended January2, 2000,
December31, 2000 and December30, 2001 was
approximately $2,004,000, $2,442,000 and $2,304,000 respectively. Preopening
Expense Preopening expenses, consisting primarily of
manager salaries and relocation expense, employee payroll and
related training costs incurred prior to the opening of a
restaurant, are expensed as incurred. Income
Taxes The Company utilizes the liability method of
accounting for income taxes as set forth in SFAS No109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. Under the liability
method, deferred taxes are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in
which the differences are expected to reverse. Recognition of
deferred tax assets is limited to amounts considered by
management to be more likely than not of realization in future
periods. Minority partners interests in income or
loss of consolidated partnerships includes no provision for
income taxes as any tax liability related thereto is the
responsibility of the individual minority partners. Stock Based
Compensation The Company grants stock options for a fixed
number of shares to certain employees with an exercise price
equal to or greater than the fair value of the shares at the
date of grant. The Company accounts for stock option grants to
employees in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB No25, and, accordingly, recognizes
no compensation expense for the stock option grants. 38 Table of Contents P.F. CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Net Income
Per Share Net income per share is computed in accordance
with SFAS No128, Earnings per Share. Fair Value of
Financial Instruments The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents,
investments, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses
approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term
maturity of these financial instruments. The fair value of
long-term debt is determined using current applicable rates for
similar instruments and collateral as of the balance sheet date
and approximates the carrying value of such debt. Segment
Reporting The Company accounts for its segments in
accordance with SFAS No131, Disclosure About
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS
No131 requires that a public company report annual and
interim financial and descriptive information about its
reportable operating segments. Operating segments, as defined,
are components of an enterprise about which separate financial
information is available that is evaluated regularly by the
chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate
resources and in assessing performance. SFAS No131 allows
aggregation of similar operating segments into a single
operating segment if the businesses are considered similar under
the criteria established by SFAS No131. The Company
operates restaurants under the P.F.Changs China
Bistro and Pei Wei brands. These two brands have similar
investment criteria, customer demographics and economic and
operating characteristics. Therefore, the Company has one
reportable operating segment. Concentrations
of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist
primarily of cash investments and receivables. The Company
maintains cash and cash equivalents, funds on deposit and
certain other financial instruments with financial institutions
that are considered in the Companys investment strategy.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are
limited as the Companys receivables are primarily with its
landlords for the reimbursement of tenant improvements. Reclassifications Certain amounts shown in the prior periods
consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to
conform to the current year consolidated financial statements
presentation. Recent
Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued SFAS No141, Business
Combinations, and No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, effective for fiscal years beginning
after December15, 2001. Under the new rules, goodwill and
intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer
be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in
accordance with the Statements. Other intangible assets will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives. For fiscal
2001, the amortization provisions of SFAS No142 apply to
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired after
June30, 2001. For fiscal 2002, the provision will apply to
all goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company will apply
the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible
assets beginning in the first quarter of 2002, including the
required impairment tests. The Company recorded approximately
$503,000 in amortization of its intangible assets during 2001
that is being evaluated by management to determine which portion
will be subject to no future amortization under FAS142. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued SFAS No144, Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
SFAS144, which addresses financial accounting and 39 Table of Contents P.F. CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued reporting for the impairment or disposal of
long-lived assets and supersedes SFAS No121,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, and
the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion
No30, Reporting the Results of Operations for
a disposal of a segment of a business. SFAS144 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December15,
2001, with earlier application encouraged. The Company expects
to adopt SFAS 144 as of December31, 2001 and it does not
expect that the adoption of the Statement will have a
significant impact on the Companys financial position and
results of operations. 2.Property and

Facility In December of 1999, the Company entered into a
revolving credit facility with a commercial lending institution.
The credit facility allows for borrowings up to $15million
at an interest rate ranging from 150 to 225basis points
over the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR. In
June of 2000 the Company amended its credit facility to allow
for borrowings up to a total of $45million with an
interest rate ranging from 100 to 225basis points over
LIBOR. The revolving credit facility expires on
November30, 2002 and contains certain restrictions and
conditions which require the Company to: maintain a minimum
tangible net worth, a leverage ratio at a maximum of
375:1, and a fixed-charge ratio no less than
125:1. A portion of the assets of the Company serves as
collateral for the credit facility. The Company had no
borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of
December30, 2001. The Company used proceeds from the
private equity placement that occurred early in 2001 to repay
the $15million in borrowings that was outstanding as of
December31, 2000. 40 Table of Contents P.F. CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

2005 $37,000; 2006 $42,000 and
thereafter $836,000. 5.Preferred
Stock and Common Stockholders Equity Preferred
Stock The board of directors is authorized to issue up
to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the
powers, preferences, privileges, rights, including voting
rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions of those
shares without any further vote or act by the common
stockholders. There is no outstanding preferred stock as of
December31, 2000 and December30, 2001. In connection with the original capitalization of
the Company, a warrant to purchase 124,380 shares of preferred
stock, convertible into 62,190 shares of common stock, was
issued to an investment bank with an exercise price of $400 per
common share. This warrant was exercised in the first quarter of
2001 in accordance with the cashless exercise provision
contained therein for an aggregate of 55,545 shares of common
stock. 41 Table of Contents P.F. CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Common
Stock In January of 2001, the Company raised
$408million in cash through a private equity placement of
125million shares of common stock with two large mutual
fund companies. The Company used $15million of the
proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under its credit
facility. Stock Option
Plans The Company has elected to follow APB No25
and related Interpretations in accounting for its employee stock
options because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value
accounting provided for under SFAS No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, requires
use of option valuation models that were not developed for use
in valuing employee stock options. Under APB No25,
because the exercise price of the Companys employee stock
options equals or exceeds the fair value of the underlying stock
on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized. In August 1996, the Company adopted the 1996
Stock Option Plan 1996 Plan, and in July 1997, the Company
adopted the 1997 Restaurant Management Stock Option Plan 1997
Plan. Options under the 1996 Plan may be granted to employees,
consultants and directors to purchase the Companys common
stock at an exercise price that equals or exceeds the fair value
of such shares on the date such option is granted. Options under
the 1997 Plan may be granted to key employees of the Company who
are actively engaged in the management and operation of the
Companys restaurants to purchase the Companys common
stock at an exercise price that equals or exceeds the fair value
of such shares on the date such option is granted. Vesting
periods are determined at the discretion of the board of
directors, and options currently outstanding at
December30, 2001 vest over five years. Options may be
exercised immediately upon grant, subject to a right by the
Company to repurchase any unvested shares at the exercise price.
Any options granted shall not be exercisable after ten years.
Upon certain changes in control of the Company, the 1996 and
1997 Plans provide for two additional years of immediate
vesting. The Company has reserved a total of
1,086,500shares of common stock for issuance under the
1996 and 1997 Plans. During 1998, the Companys Board of
Directors approved the 1998 Stock Option Plan 1998 Plan which
provides for discretionary grants of incentive stock options and
nonqualified stock options to the Companys employees,
including officers, directors, consultants, advisors, and other
independent contractors. A total of 606,885 additional shares of
common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 1998
Plan. The option price per share for an incentive stock option
may not be less than 100percent of the fair market value
of a share of common stock on the grant date. The option price
per share for a nonstatutory stock option may not be less than
85percent of the fair market value of a share of common
stock on the grant date. The Companys Compensation
Committee has the authority to, among other things, determine
the vesting schedule for each option granted. All options expire
within 10years. The 1998 Plan includes an automatic grant
program for outside directors. Pursuant to this program, each
outside director will be granted an option to purchase
15,000shares of common stock at the time he or she is
first elected or appointed a director of the Company. In
addition, each outside director remaining in office will be
granted an option to purchase 7,500immediately fully
vested shares on the day following each annual meeting of
stockholders. During 1999, the Companys Board of
Directors approved the 1999 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan 1999
Plan, which provides for discretionary grants of nonqualified
stock options to the Companys employees. The 1999 Plan
prohibits grants to officers or directors. A total of
400,000shares of common stock have been reserved for
issuance under the 1999 Plan. The option price per share may not
be less than 85percent of the fair market value of a share
of common stock on the grant date. The Companys
Compensation Committee has the authority to, among other things,
determine the vesting schedule for each option granted. All
options expire within 10years. 42 Table of Contents P.F. CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Pro forma information regarding net income is
required by SFAS No123, which also requires that the
information be determined as if the Company has accounted for
its employee stock options granted subsequent to
December31, 1994 under the fair value method of that
Statement. The fair value for these options was estimated at the
date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following weighted-average assumptions for 1999 and 2000 and
2001: risk-free interest rate of 55percent; a dividend
yield of -0-percent; volatility factors of the expected
market price of the Companys common stock of 497, 559
and 433 respectively; and a weighted-average expected life of
the option of five years. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price
volatility. Because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
managements opinion, the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value
of its employee stock options. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the
estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over
the options vesting period. The Companys pro forma

represents the only issued and outstanding shares. 44 Table of Contents P.F. CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Employee Stock Purchase Plan During 1998, the Companys Board of
Directors approved the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Purchase Plan and reserved 400,000shares for issuance
thereunder. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to
purchase common stock at a discount, but only through payroll
deductions, during concurrent 24month offering periods.
Each offering period will be divided into four consecutive
6-month purchase periods. The price at which stock is purchased
under the Purchase Plan is equal to 85percent of the lower
of the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of
the offering period and the fair market value of the common
stock on the last day of the purchase period. 6.Partnership
Agreements P.F. Changs has implemented a partnership
structure to facilitate the development, leadership and
operation of its restaurants. Each partner is required to make a
capital contribution in exchange for a specified interest in the
restaurant or region the partner is employed to manage. The
ownership interest purchased by each partner generally ranges
between two and seven percent of the restaurant or region the
partner oversees. At the end of a specific term generally five
years, P.F.Changs has the right, but not the
obligation, to purchase the minority partners interest in
the partners respective restaurant or region at fair
market value. An estimated fair value is determined by reference
to current industry purchase metrics as well as the discounted
cash flows of the subject restaurants/ regions
financial results. The Company has the option to pay the agreed
upon purchase price in cash or common stock of the company over
a period of time not to exceed five years. As of December30, 2001, there were 90
partners within the P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc. system.
During 2001, we purchased the interests of 11 of our minority
partners for a total of approximately $19million, of
which the majority was recorded as intangibles in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. Approximately $924,000 of the total purchase price was
paid in cash while the remaining balance has been recorded as
amounts due to related parties on the balance sheet at
December30, 2001. In 2002, we will have the opportunity to
purchase five additional partnership interests. If all of these
interests were fully purchased, the total purchase price would
approximate $50 to $60million based upon the estimated
fair value of the respective interests at December30,
2001. Such amounts are subject to change based upon changes in
the estimated fair value of the respective interests from
December30, 2001 through the date of purchase. 7.Income
