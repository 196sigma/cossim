43 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
44 38 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of SIGA Technologies, Inc.: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of changes in stockholders' equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of SIGA Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiary at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Company management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2009, the Company changed the way certain financial instruments that are settled in the Company common stock are accounted for. A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS, LLP New York, New York

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation Description of Business
SIGA Technologies, Inc. SIGA or the Company is a bio-defense company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of novel products for the prevention and treatment of serious infectious diseases, including products for use in defense against biological warfare agents such as smallpox and arenaviruses. The Companys antiviral programs are designed to prevent or limit the replication of viral pathogens. Basis of presentation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America US GAAP and reflect the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred cumulative net losses and expects to incur additional losses to perform further research and development activities. The Company does not have commercial products and has limited capital resources. Managements plans with regard to these matters include continued development of its products as well as pursuing commercial opportunities and seeking additional capital through a combination of collaborative agreements, strategic alliances, research grants, and future equity and debt financing. Although management will continue to pursue these plans, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining future financing on commercially reasonable terms or that the Company will be able to secure funding from anticipated government contracts and grants. Management believes that existing funds combined with cash flows primarily from continuing government grants and contracts will be sufficient to support its operations for at least the next twelve months. The success of the Company is dependent upon commercializing its research and development programs and the Companys ability to obtain adequate future financing. If the Company is unable to raise adequate capital and/or achieve profitable operations, future operations might need to be scaled back or discontinued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the carrying amount of recorded assets and liabilities that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates
The consolidated financial statements and related disclosures are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the period reported. These estimates include the variables used in the calculation of fair value for outstanding options and warrants granted or issued by the Company; impairment of goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets, and the realization of deferred tax assets. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Cash Equivalents, Short-term Investments and Marketable Securities
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months and less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Such investments are generally money market funds, bank certificates of deposit, and U.S. Treasury bills. The Company classifies short-term investments and marketable securities with readily determinable fair values as available-for-sale. Investments in securities that are classified as available-for-sale are measured at fair market value in the balance sheet and unrealized holding gains and losses on investments are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized. 44 As of December 31, 2010 and 2009 the Companys short-term investments consisted of approximately $150 million and $50 million, respectively, of available-for-sale United States Treasury Bills. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the unrealized gain relating to these investments was immaterial. Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company has cash in bank accounts that exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its cash accounts. No allowance has been provided for potential credit losses because management believes that any such losses would be minimal. The Companys accounts payable consist of trade payables due to creditors. Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various asset classes. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 5 years for laboratory equipment; 3 years for computer equipment; and 7 years for furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term. Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred. Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured, contractual obligations have been satisfied and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer. The Company recognizes revenue from non-refundable up-front payments, not tied to achieving a specific performance milestone, over the period which the Company is obligated to perform services or based on the percentage of costs incurred to date, estimated costs to complete and total expected contract revenue. Payments for development activities are recognized as revenue as earned, over the period of effort. Funding for the acquisition of capital assets under cost-plus-fee grants and contracts is evaluated for appropriate recognition as a reduction to the cost of the asset, a financing arrangement, or revenue based on the specific terms of the related grant or contract. Substantive at-risk milestone payments, which are based on achieving a specific performance milestone, are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due, providing there is no future service obligation associated with that milestone. In situations in which the Company receives payment in advance of the performance of services, such amounts are deferred and recognized as revenue as the related services are performed. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, revenues from National Institutes of Health NIH contracts and grants was 91%, 100% and 995%, respectively, of total revenues recognized by the Company. Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are recorded net of provisions for doubtful accounts. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, 87% and 100%, respectively, of accounts receivables represented receivables from NIH. An allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specific analysis of the receivables. At December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, the Company had no allowance for doubtful accounts. Research and Development
Research and development expenses include costs directly attributable to the conduct of research and development programs, including employee related costs, materials, supplies, depreciation on and maintenance of research equipment, the cost of services provided by outside contractors, including services related to the Companys clinical trials and facility costs, such as rent, utilities, and general support services. All costs associated with research and development are expensed as incurred. Costs related to the acquisition of technology rights, for which development work is still in process, and that have no alternative future uses, are expensed as incurred. Goodwill
The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant. The impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value. The Company operates as one business and one reporting unit. Therefore, the goodwill impairment analysis is performed on the basis of the Company as a whole, using the market capitalization of the Company as an estimate of its fair value. 45 Share-based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors is determined based on estimated grant-date fair value using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recorded as expense over the requisite service periods in the Companys consolidated statement of operations. These compensation costs are recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service periods of the awards. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of the respective grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differ materially from original estimates. Income Taxes
The Company recognizes income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that some or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company applies the applicable authoritative guidance which prescribes a comprehensive model for the manner in which a company should recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements all material uncertain tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. The Company has no tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months from December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, the only tax jurisdiction to which the Company is subject is the United States. Open tax years relate to years in which unused net operating losses were generated. Thus, the Companys open tax years extend back to 1996. In the event that the Company concludes that it is subject to interest and/or penalties arising from uncertain tax positions, the Company will present interest and penalties as a component of income taxes. No amounts of interest or penalties were recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010. Net Loss per Share
The Company computes, presents and discloses earnings per share in accordance with the authoritative guidance which specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings per share of entities with publicly held common stock or potential common stock. The objective of basic EPS is to measure the performance of an entity over the reporting period by dividing income loss by the weighted average shares outstanding. The objective of diluted EPS is consistent with that of basic EPS, that is to measure the performance of an entity over the reporting period, while giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS except the denominator is increased for the conversion of potential common shares unless the impact of such common shares is anti-dilutive. The Company incurred losses for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, and as a result, certain equity instruments are excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share. At December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, outstanding options to purchase 4,719,628, 6,249,917 and 7,696,054 shares, respectively, of the Companys common stock with exercise prices ranging from $094 to $932 have been excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as the effect of such shares is anti-dilutive. At December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, outstanding warrants to purchase 3,155,537, 5,011,141 and 7,456,406 shares, respectively, of the Companys common stock, with exercise prices ranging from $118 to $480 have been excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as they are anti-dilutive. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. Common stock warrants which are classified as liabilities are recorded at their fair market value as of each reporting period. The Company applies the applicable authoritative guidance for financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 46 The measurement of fair value requires the use of techniques based on observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. The inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations where inputs are observable or where significant value drivers are observable.
Level 3 Instruments where significant value drivers are unobservable to third parties. The Company uses model-derived valuations where inputs are observable in active markets to determine the fair value of certain common stock warrants on a recurring basis and classify such warrants in Level 2. The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes model consisting of the following variables: i the closing price of SIGAs common stock; ii the expected remaining life of the warrant; iii the expected volatility using a weighted-average of historical volatilities from a combination of SIGA and comparable companies; and iv the risk-free market rate. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the fair value of such warrants was as follows: 2010
2009
Common stock warrants classified as current liabilities 3,260,000
Common stock warrants classified as long-term liabilities 10,524,660 9,733,870
Total 10,524,660 12,993,870 As of December 31, 2010, the Company held approximately $150 million in United States Treasury Bills, classified as a Level 1 security. SIGA does not hold any Level 3 securities. Segment Information 
The Company is managed and operated as one business. The entire business is managed by a single management team that reports to the chief executive officer. The Company does not operate separate lines of business or separate business entities with respect to any of its product candidates. Accordingly, the Company does not prepare discrete financial information with respect to separate product areas or by location and only has one reportable segment. Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles
On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted the provisions of the authoritative guidance for derivatives and hedging. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded by the Company in connection with certain warrants to acquire shares of the Companys common stock, was recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit as summarized in the following table: As reported on

In October 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard updating existing multiple-element arrangement guidance. The revised guidance requires companies to allocate revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables based on the estimated selling price of each deliverable, even if such deliverables are not sold separately by either company itself or other vendors. The revised guidance also significantly expands the disclosures required for multiple-element revenue arrangements. The revised guidance will be effective for the first annual period beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance on January 1, 2010, which had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance for fair value measurements. This update provides amendments that require new disclosure as follows: 1 A reporting entity should disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair-value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers. 2 In the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs Level 3, a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements that is, on a gross basis rather than as one net number. This update provides amendments that clarify existing disclosures as follows: 1 A reporting entity should provide fair-value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities. A class is often a subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in the statement of financial position. A reporting entity needs to use judgment in determining the appropriate classes of assets and liabilities. 2 A reporting entity should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. Those disclosures are required for fair value measurements that fall in either Level 2 or Level 3. The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll-forward of activity in Level 3 fair-value measurements. Those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has adopted the amendments effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not yet adopted the amendments effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2010. SIGA does not expect the preceding amendments to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 47 3. Research Agreements The Company obtains funding in the form of grants or contracts collectively, the Grants from various agencies of the U.S. Government to support its research and development activities. As of December 31, 2010, the Company has five active Grants with varying expiration dates though August 2013 that provide for aggregate research and development funding for specific projects of approximately $991 million. At December 31, 2010, the Company has recognized $344 million of revenue from these grants. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $647 million is available to support future research and development activities. The Grants contain customary terms and conditions including the U.S. Governments right to terminate a grant for convenience. 4. Stockholders Equity On December 31, 2010, the Company authorized share capital consisted of 110,000,000 shares, of which 100,000,000 are designated common shares and 10,000,000 are designated preferred shares. The Company Board of Directors is authorized to issue preferred shares in series with rights, privileges and qualifications of each series determined by the Board. 2009 Financing
On December 9, 2009, the Company entered into Subscription Agreements for the sale of 2,725,339 shares of the Companys common stock, par value $00001 per share, at a purchase price of $735 per share. Net proceeds to the Company were approximately $186 million. 2008 Financing
On June 19, 2008, SIGA entered into a letter agreement as amended, the Letter Agreement that expired on June 19, 2010, with MacAndrews Forbes LLC MF, a related party, for MFs commitment to invest, at SIGAs discretion or at MFs option, up to $8 million in exchange for i SIGA common stock and ii warrants to purchase 40% of the number of SIGA shares acquired by MF. On June 18, 2010, MF notified SIGA of its intention to exercise its right to invest $55 million, the remaining amount available under the Letter Agreement and entered into a Deferred Closing and Registration Rights Agreement dated as of June 18, 2010 with the Company. On July 26, 2010, upon satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions, including the expiration of the applicable waiting period pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, MF funded the $55 million purchase price to SIGA in exchange for the issuance of i 1,797,386 shares of common stock and ii warrants to purchase 718,954 shares of SIGA common stock at an exercise price of $3519 per share. The number of shares issuable pursuant to the warrants granted under the Letter Agreement, as well as the exercise price of those warrants, may be subject to adjustment as a result of the effect of future equity issuances on certain anti-dilution provisions in the related warrant agreements. In 2009, SIGA issued to MF 816,993 shares of common stock and 326,797 warrants to acquire common stock in exchange for total proceeds of $25 million. The warrants are exercisable for a term of four years from issuance for an exercise price of $3519 per share. The number of shares issuable pursuant to the warrants granted under the Letter Agreement, as well as the exercise price of those warrants, may be subject to adjustment as a result of the effect of future equity issuances on certain anti-dilution provisions in the warrant agreements. 48 In addition and in consideration for the commitment of MF reflected in the Letter Agreement, on June 19, 2008, MF received warrants to purchase 238,000 shares of SIGA common stock, initially exercisable at $306 the Commitment Warrants. The number of shares issuable pursuant to the warrants granted under the Letter Agreement, as well as the exercise price of those warrants, may be subject to adjustment as a result of the effect of future equity issuances on certain anti-dilution provisions in the Letter Agreement. The Commitment Warrants are exercisable until June 19, 2012. The Company initially recorded all costs related to the Letter Agreement, including the fair value of the Commitment Warrants, as deferred transaction costs. Upon the issuance of common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock on April 30, 2009, the Company recorded a reduction in its additional paid-in capital for the effect of the related transaction costs. The Company determined that the warrants potentially issuable to MF under the Letter Agreement were not indexed to the Companys own stock prior to their issuance in accordance with the authoritative guidance. As a result, warrants potentially issuable under the Letter Agreement met the definition of a derivative and were recorded as a liability on the Companys balance sheet also refer to Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principle in Note 2. Management determined that, upon issuance, the warrants do not meet the definition of a derivative and, consequently, the warrants are reflected as equity at December 31, 2010. The Company recorded a loss of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 representing the increase in the fair value of the warrants from January 1, 2010 through the date of issuance. 2006 and 2005 Placements
In 2006 and 2005 the Company sold shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock. In 2006, the Company issued 1,000,000 warrants with an initial exercise price of $499 per share the 2006 Warrants. In 2005, the Company issued 1,000,000 warrants with an initial exercise price of $118 per share the 2005 Warrants. As of December 31, 2010, all of the 2005 Warrants have been exercised and issued. The 2006 Warrants may be exercised through and including October 19, 2013. Due to the effect of certain anti-dilution provisions in such warrants, the Company adjusted the number of shares issuable under the 2006 Warrants by 652,038 through December 31, 2010. The exercise prices of the warrants issued in these placements were also adjusted. At December 31, 2010, 915,568 of the 2006 Warrants at an exercise price of $292 were outstanding. The number of shares issuable pursuant to the Warrants may be subject to further adjustment as a result of the effect of future equity issuances on anti-dilution provisions in the related warrant agreements. The Company accounted for the 2006 and 2005 Warrants in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that free-standing derivative financial instruments that require net cash settlement be classified as assets or liabilities at the time of the transaction, and recorded at their fair value. Any changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments be reported in earnings or loss as long as the derivative contracts are classified as assets or liabilities. At December 31, 2010, the fair market value of the 2006 Warrants was $105 million. The Company applied the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair values of the respective derivative instruments using the contractual term of the warrants. Management estimates the expected volatility using a combination of the Companys historical volatility and the volatility of a group of comparable companies. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded a loss of $149 million as a result of a net increase in the 2005 and 2006 Warrants. 5. Stock Option Plan and Warrants In May 2010, the Company adopted its 2010 Incentive Stock Option Plan the 2010 Plan to supersede its 1996 Incentive and Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan the 1996 Plan. The 2010 Plan provides for the granting of up to 2,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock to employees, consultants and outside directors of the Company. The awards that may be provided under the 2010 Plan include: Incentive Stock Options ISOs and Nonqualified Stock Options; shares of Restricted Stock; and shares of Unrestricted Stock. Stock option awards provide holders the right to purchase shares of Common Stock at prices determined by the Compensation Committee but must have an exercise price equal to or in excess of the fair market value of the Companys common stock at the date of grant. The vesting period for options granted under the 2010 Plan, except those granted to outside directors, is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee also determines the expiration date of each Stock Option, however, no ISO is exercisable more than ten years after the date of grant. The maximum term of options awarded under the 2010 Plan is ten years. 49 During 1996, the Company established its 1996 Plan which, as amended, provided for the granting of up to 11,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock to employees, consultants and outside directors of the Company. The exercise period for options granted under the Plan, except those granted to outside directors, is determined by a committee of the Board of Directors. Stock options granted to outside directors pursuant to the Plan must have an exercise price equal to or in excess of the fair market value of the Companys common stock at the date of grant. There will be no future awards from the 1996 Plan. The fair value of option grants were estimated at the date of grant during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 based upon the following weighted average assumptions: 2010
2009
2008
Expected volatility
8021 8140 6850 Expected dividend yield
000 000 000 Risk-free interest rate
216 221 279 Expected life
5 years
5 years
5 years Expected volatility has been estimated using a combination of the Companys historical volatility and the historical volatility of a group of comparable companies, both using historical periods equivalent to the options expected lives. The expected dividend yield assumption is based on the Companys intent not to issue a dividend in the foreseeable future. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for securities with maturities approximating the options expected lives. The expected life was estimated based on historical experience and expectation of employee exercise behavior in the future giving consideration to the contractual terms of the award. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, the Company recorded compensation expense of $15 million, $21 million and $10 million, respectively. The total fair value of options vested during each year was $15 million, $14 million and $595,000 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options granted was $495, $429 and $172 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $196 million, $70 million and $09 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The intrinsic value represents the amount by which the market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of an option. 50 As of December 31, 2009, options awarded outside of the plan included 125,000 options granted in May 2000 to the Companys Chief Scientific Officer, with an exercise price of $200 per share. These options were exercised in 2010 for total proceeds of approximately $250,000. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, 500,000 of the Companys outstanding options, respectively, were subject to specific performance conditions which included revenue thresholds and regulatory approval of our lead drug candidate. These options are not exercisable at December 31, 2010. The following tables summarize information about warrants outstanding at December 31, 2010: Number of

The agreement is cancelable upon 60 days notice by SIGA or the affiliate. A member of the Companys Board of Directors is a member of the Companys outside counsel. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, the Company incurred costs of $27 million, $18 million and $10 million, respectively, related to services provided by the outside counsel. On December 31, 2010, the Companys outstanding payables included $485,000 payable to the outside counsel. 7.

Net operating losses

25,340

175 Deferred income tax liabilities, net 175 The Company has incurred losses since inception, which have generated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $687 million at December 31, 2010 for federal and state income tax purposes. These carryforwards are available to offset future taxable income and expire beginning in 2011 for federal income tax purposes. As a result of a previous change in stock ownership, the annual utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards from years prior to 2004 may be subject to limitation. In consideration of the Companys accumulated losses and the uncertainty of its ability to utilize this deferred tax asset in the future, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of an equal amount on such date to fully offset the deferred tax asset. The deferred tax assets for the respective periods were assessed for recoverability and, where applicable, a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized in the future. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was an increase of $48 million and a increase of $38 million, respectively. The increase in the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 relates primarily to net operating loss carryforwards. The Companys effective tax rate differs from the U.S. Federal Statutory income tax rate of 34% as follows: 2010
2009
Statutory federal income tax rate
3400 3400 State tax benefit, net of federal taxes
230 252 Loss from fair value of common warrants
1936 1318 Other
181 376 Valuation allowance on deferred tax assets
1445 1958 Effective tax rate
068 000 52 For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Companys effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate principally due to net operating losses and other differences for which no benefit was recorded, state taxes and other permanent differences. Other Income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2010, includes $648,000 awarded to the Company under the U.S. Government Qualified Discovery Tax Credit program offset by a $175,000 deferred tax provision associated with a temporary difference generated from the amortization of goodwill for tax purposes. 10. Commitments and Contingencies Operating lease commitments The Company leases certain facilities and office space under operating leases. Certain leases contain renewal provisions and generally require us to pay utilities, insurance, taxes and other operating expenses. Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2010 consist of $573,077 due in 2011. Other In December 2006, PharmAthene, Inc. PharmAthene filed an action against us in the Delaware Court of Chancery captioned PharmAthene, Inc. v. SIGA Technologies, Inc., C.A. No. 2627-N. In its amended complaint, PharmAthene asks the Court to demand SIGA enter into a license agreement with PharmAthene with respect to ST-246, as well as issue a declaration that we are obliged to execute such a license agreement, and award damages resulting from our supposed breach of that obligation. PharmAthene also alleges that we breached an obligation to negotiate such a license agreement in good faith, as well as seeks damages for promissory estoppel and unjust enrichment based on supposed information, capital and assistance that PharmAthene allegedly provided to us during the negotiation process. In January 2008, the Court of Chancery denied our motion to dismiss the original complaint and discovery proceeded. In May 2009, PharmAthene amended its complaint with respect to its claim for breach of an obligation to negotiate in good faith, and we filed our answer to the amended complaint and counterclaim denying the new claim and asserting defenses. PharmAthene has submitted an expert report asserting several alternative theories of damages, in a wide range of up to one billion dollars. We believe that the experts damages analyses are flawed and methodologically unsound. The Company continues to believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims. The Company filed a partial summary judgment motion on March 19, 2010, regarding certain aspects of PharmAthenes claims and damage assessments. On November 23, 2010, the Court of Chancery denied the motion for partial summary judgment. A trial was held before Vice Chancellor Donald F. Parsons, Jr. on January 3 -7, 10-12, 18-19 and 21, 2011. The Court reserved decision, and the parties are currently preparing post-trial briefs. Closing arguments are scheduled for April 2011. It is not currently possible to estimate a range of loss, if any. From time to time, the Company is involved in disputes or legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that there is no other dispute or litigation pending that could have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 53 11.

Controls and Procedures  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2010. The term disclosure controls and procedures is defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Office and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2010 at a reasonable level of assurance. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15f or Rule 15d-15f of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  
a.
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the Companys assets b.
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and c.
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. In making this evaluation, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on this evaluation using the COSO criteria, management concluded that the Company internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.  The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. 55  Remediation of Material Weakness  In our restated Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2009, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2009, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP due to the following material weakness:  We did not maintain effective controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy of non-cash charges resulting from required adjustments to certain outstanding warrants the Warrants. These adjustments were triggered by the application of certain anti-dilution provisions included in the agreements governing the Warrants and resulted in the issuance of additional warrants to acquire shares of common stock and additional non-cash charges which were not recorded in the appropriate accounting periods. This material weakness resulted in a material misstatement of our liabilities, non-cash expense relating to the changes in fair value of common stock warrants and accumulated deficit accounts and related financial disclosures that was not prevented and detected on a timely basis. As a result, the Companys consolidated financial statements were restated for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 and each of the quarterly periods from June 30, 2008 through June 30, 2010. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Subsequent to the identification of the material weakness, management developed a remediation plan to address the material weakness. The remediation plan consisted of redesigning quarterly procedures to enhance managements identification, capture, review, approval and recording of contractual terms included in active contracts or arrangements. During the quarters ended September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2010, management tested the design and operating effectiveness of the newly implemented controls. As a result, management concluded that the material weakness described above has been remediated as of December 31, 2010. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Except as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information  None. 56 PART III
