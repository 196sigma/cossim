Item8.Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT The Board of Directors LCC International, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of LCC International, Inc. and its subsidiaries
the Company as of December31, 2002 and 2003,
and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December31, 2003. In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
statements, we have also audited the related financial statement
schedule. These consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of LCC International, Inc. and
its subsidiaries as of December31, 2002 and 2003, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December31, 2003, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein. KPMG LLP McLean, Virginia March19, 2004 37 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND

Supplemental disclosures of non-cash investing
and financing activities In January 2002, we purchased all of the assets
of Smith Woolley Telecom for a purchase price of approximately
$86million. The purchase price consisted of
$71million in cash included above as part of business
acquisitions and the issuance of 215,000 shares of our
classA common stock, par value $001 per share. The value
of the classA common stock was approximately
$15million. As a result, common stock and additional paid
in capital increased, offset by an increase to goodwill and
other intangibles. In May 2003, in satisfaction of the purchase
agreement between Westminster Capital, B.V.
Westminster and our company, we paid Westminster
approximately $03million in cash and assigned an
intercompany note receivable due from Detron to Westminster in
the amount of approximately $02million. As a result of
the note assignment, goodwill and other intangible assets
increased, offset by an increase in due to related parties,
which is included in accounts payable on the consolidated
balance sheet. The accompanying notes are an integral part of
the Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and
2003 1Description
of Operations LCC International Inc. a Delaware Corporation
LCCI, was formed in 1983. Unless the context
indicates otherwise, the terms the Company,
we, us, and our refer herein
to LCCI. We provide integrated end-to-end solutions for
wireless voice and data communication networks with service
offerings ranging from high level technical consulting, to
system design and deployment, to ongoing operations and
maintenance services. We operate in a highly competitive
environment subject to rapid technological change and emergence
of new technologies. Historically, the key drivers of changes in
our wireless services business have been 1the issuance
of new or additional licenses to wireless operators;
2the introduction of new services or technologies;
3increases in the number of subscribers served by
wireless operators; 4the increasing complexity of
wireless systems in operation and 5changes in wireless
infrastructure spending and deployment. Although we believe that
our services are transferable to emerging technologies, rapid
changes in technology and deployment could have an adverse
financial impact on us. In November 2003, we completed an underwritten
public offering of 8,050,000 shares of class A common stock, of
which 5,000,000 shares were sold by certain of our stockholders.
We received net proceeds for $115million from the
offering. 2Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies Principles of
Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Cash
Equivalents Cash equivalents include all highly liquid
investments purchased with original maturities of three months
or less and include overnight repurchase agreements, short-term
notes, and short-term money market funds. Short-Term
Investments During 2002, short-term investments consisted
primarily of federally sponsored short-term notes with maturity
dates of more than three months from the date of acquisition.
During 2003, short-term investments consist of a certificate of
deposit with a maturity of six months from the date of
acquisition. The portfolio held by us has been classified based
on managements intentions as to future investment
activity. We carry these investments at cost plus accrued
interest receivable, which approximates their market value. All
short-term investments have maturity dates of one year or less. Concentration
of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially expose us
to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade
receivables. We sell our services globally. Generally, we do not
require collateral or other security to support customer
receivables. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our
customers financial condition and maintain a provision for
doubtful accounts related to potential credit losses. We had the
following significant 42 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND

Our existing and potential customer base is
diverse and includes start-up companies and foreign enterprises.
We derived approximately 829%, 603% and 729% of our revenues
from our ten largest customers for the years ended
December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. These ten
largest customers constituted 664% and 812% of our net
receivable balance as of December31, 2002 and 2003,
respectively. Although we believe that the diversity of our
customer base has historically minimized the risk of incurring
material losses due to concentrations of credit risk, we may be
exposed to a declining customer base in periods of market
downturns, severe competition, exchange rate fluctuations or
other international developments. In 2003, revenues from one customer were
approximately $165million or 152% of total revenues,
revenues from another customer were approximately
$130million or 120% of total revenues and revenues from
a third customer were approximately $115million or 106%
of total revenues. In 2002, revenues from one customer were
approximately $78million or 117% of total revenues and
revenues from another customer were $70million or 105%
of total revenues. In 2001, revenues from one customer were
approximately $573million or 439% of total revenues. Fair Value of
Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of financial instruments,
including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and
accounts payable, approximated fair value as of
December31, 2002 and 2003 because of the relatively short
duration of these instruments. The carrying value of the note
receivable from shareholder and the line of credit approximated
the fair value as the instrument included a market rate of
interest. Property and
Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, less
an allowance for depreciation. Replacements and major
improvements are capitalized; maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
related assets per the table below.   
Computer equipment

Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets Our policy is to review our long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in
accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. We recognize an impairment
loss when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows
is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The measurement
of the impairment losses to be recognized is based upon the
difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the
assets. 43 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair
value of assets of businesses acquired. We adopted the
provisions of SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, as of January1, 2002. Goodwill and
intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination
and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not
amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually
in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No142. SFAS
No142 also requires that intangible assets with estimable
useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful
lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for
impairment in accordance with SFAS No144. Investments
in Affiliates We use the equity method to account for those
investments in which we have an ownership interest equal to or
greater than 20% or exercise significant influence. For equity
method investments, we record our proportionate share of the
investees net income or loss. Generally, we use the cost
method of accounting for our investments in which we have an
ownership interest of less than 20% or do not exercise
significant influence. Investments carried at cost are written
down if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
investment may not be recoverable. Revenue
Recognition Our principal sources of revenues are design
services and system deployment services. We recognize revenues
from long-term fixed-price contracts using the
percentage-of-completion method. With the
percentage-of-completion method, we recognize revenue based on
the ratio of individual contract costs incurred to date on a
project compared with total estimated contract costs.
Anticipated contract losses are recognized as soon as they
become known and estimable. We also recognize revenues on time
and materials contracts as the services are performed. Revenues
earned but not yet billed are reflected as unbilled receivables
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We expect
substantially all unbilled and billed receivables to be
collected within one year. Income
Taxes Income taxes are determined in accordance with
SFAS No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. Under this statement, temporary differences
arise as a result of the differences between the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the
opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects
of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. Certain of our international operations are
subject to local income taxation. Currently, we are subject to
taxation on income from certain operations in Europe, Latin
America, the Far East, the Middle East and the non-U.S. portions
of North America where we have subsidiaries, have established
branch offices or have performed significant services that
constitute a permanent establishment for tax
reporting purposes. The foreign taxes paid or accrued by us may
represent a potential credit for us against our U.S. federal
income taxes. Foreign
Currency Translation Gains and losses on translation of the accounts
of our foreign operations where the local currency is the
functional currency are accumulated and included in other
comprehensive loss within the accompanying consolidated
statement of shareholders equity. Foreign currency
transaction gains and losses are recognized currently in the
consolidated statements of operations. 44 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Use of
Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other
things, long-term contracts, allowance for doubtful accounts,
accrual of income taxes, recoverability of investments in
affiliates and the accrual of restructuring charges. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Stock-Based
Compensation We account for equity-based compensation
arrangements in accordance with the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related interpretations including FASB Interpretation
No44, and comply with the disclosure provisions of SFAS
No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. All equity-based awards to non-employees
are accounted for at their fair value in accordance with SFAS
No123. Under APB No25, compensation expense is
based upon the difference, if any, on the date of grant, between
the fair value of our stock and the exercise price. Had compensation cost for our stock-based
compensation plans and employee stock purchase plan been
determined on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under
those plans, consistent with SFAS No123, our net income

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting No150, Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities
and Equity SFAS No150. This statement
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures
certain financial instruments with both liability and equity
characteristics. It requires that an issuer classify a
freestanding financial instrument that is within its scope as a
liability or as an asset in some circumstances. Many of these
freestanding financial instruments were previously classified as
equity. SFAS No150 became effective for financial
instruments entered into or modified after May31, 2003. We
have evaluated the impact of SFAS No150 on our
consolidated financial statements with respect to our right to
buy out the minority interests in several of our subsidiaries.
The adoption of SFAS No150 did not have a material impact
on our consolidated financial statements. 3Tower
Portfolio Sale and Administration During 2000, Microcell Management, Inc.
Microcell, our subsidiary, completed the closing
of the sale of its telecommunication tower portfolio to Pinnacle
Towers Inc. Pinnacle pursuant to an Asset Purchase
Agreement between Pinnacle and Microcell. During 2000, Microcell
conveyed 177 tower sites to Pinnacle for net cash proceeds of
$722million. On February15, 2000, Microcell and the
Company entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement with the
minority shareholders of Microcell. Pursuant to the Settlement
and Release Agreement, concurrent with the Pinnacle tower sale,
the aggregate 1625% minority shareholder interests were
redeemed and other costs paid and/or reimbursed for
$72million. The payment was capitalized as part of the
cost of acquiring the Microcell assets and was expensed as sites
were conveyed to Pinnacle. As part of the agreement, all pending
claims of the minority shareholders were settled and dismissed
with prejudice. As part of the tower sale transaction, Microcell
and Pinnacle entered into a Master Antenna Site Lease pursuant
to which Microcell agreed to lease, until December31,
2002, the unoccupied space on each telecommunication tower sold
to Pinnacle. As of December31, 2000, we had recognized a
gain of $264million on the sale of the tower portfolio
and deferred $52million of the gain. During 2001, we
recognized $32million of the deferred gain, which was
offset by $02million in related operating expenses.
Microcell and Pinnacle also entered into a Tower Services
Agreement to provide Pinnacle with audit, maintenance, and
program management services. The Tower Services Agreement, which
expired in August 2001, provided for minimum annual payments to
Microcell of $10million for the contemplated services. On January25, 2002, we entered into a
settlement agreement with Pinnacle. Pursuant to the agreement,
we received $20million in cash to satisfy Pinnacles
obligations under the Tower Services Agreement. This gain was
recognized in the second quarter of 2002, when all uncertainties
related to any potential claims against the payment received
were resolved. In addition, we paid Pinnacle $20million
to satisfy all remaining obligations under the Master Antenna
Site Lease. 46 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND

Transactions RF Investors, a subsidiary of Telcom Ventures,
indirectly owns the ClassB Common Stock shares
outstanding, which have ten-to-one voting rights over the
ClassA Common Stock shares and therefore represent
approximately 70% voting control. Prior to our initial public offering, both our
employees and the employees of Telcom Ventures were eligible to
participate in our life, medical, dental and 401k plans. In
connection with the initial public offering in 1996, we agreed
pursuant to an Overhead and Administrative Services Agreement to
allow the employees of Telcom Ventures to continue to
participate in our employee benefit plans in exchange for full
reimbursement of the cash costs and expenses. We billed Telcom
Ventures $141,000 and $71,000 during 2002 and 2003,
respectively, for payments made by us pursuant to this
agreement. We received reimbursements from Telcom Ventures of
$324,000 during 2002 which included payments for prior periods
and $65,000 during 2003. At December31, 2002 and 2003,
outstanding amounts associated with payments made by us under
this agreement were $9,000 and $6,000, respectively, and are
included as due from related parties and affiliates within the
consolidated balance sheets in the accompanying financial
statements. We also had an understanding with Telcom Ventures
pursuant to which from July1, 2000 to December31,
2000 we retained five employees who had worked in the business
development group of our tower subsidiary, Microcell, before the
assets of that subsidiary were sold in March 2000. During the
six-month period, these employees pursued international
telecommunications tower business opportunities on Telcom
Ventures behalf. In return, we would be Telcom
Ventures exclusive provider of project management, radio
frequency engineering and deployment services for any
tower-related projects secured by these employees during this
six-month period. In addition, Telcom Ventures is required to
reimburse us for all costs incurred in employing these persons
including payroll and benefit costs. This arrangement has been
terminated. We received reimbursements from Telcom Ventures of
$140,000 during 2002 for outstanding amounts associated with
this arrangement. At December31, 2002, outstanding amounts
associated with payments made by us under this arrangement were
$100,000 in expense reimbursements and other payments for 2001
that were initially disputed by Telcom Ventures. This matter was
fully resolved in April 2003 with Telcom Ventures payment of the
full $100,000 in dispute. At December 31, 2003, no amounts were
outstanding under this arrangement. The amounts outstanding as
of December31, 2002, less reserves, are included as due
from related parties and affiliates within the consolidated
balance sheets in the accompanying financial statements In September 1996, we lent $35million to
Telcom Ventures to assist in the payment of taxes due in
connection with the assumption by us of $300 million of
convertible subordinated debt from Telcom Ventures. The original
note was payable over five years with equal annual principal
payments over the term. Interest accrued at the rate of LIBOR,
plus 175%. We received the final payment of principal and
accrued interest of approximately $700,000 during 2002 in
satisfaction of the note. During 2001 and 2002, we provided services to XM
Satellite Radio. Telcom Ventures has a minority investment in XM
Satellite Radio, and Dr.Rajendra Singh, a director of
Telcom Ventures, is a member of our board of directors.
Dr.Singh is also a former member of XM Satellite
Radios board of directors. Revenues 47 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued earned during 2001 and 2002 for services provided
to XM Satellite Radio were $573million, and
$34million, respectively. In December 1999, we issued approximately 108,000
shares of ClassA Common Stock in exchange for a
$16million note receivable from our President and Chief
Executive Officer. The note is payable on the earlier of
December 2004 or the date he is no longer our President and
Chief Executive Officer. Upon the event of a change in control
of ownership of the Company, the note will be forgiven. Interest
accrues at the federal mid-term rate on the date of the note and
is payable quarterly. The note is reflected as a reduction of
shareholders equity in the accompanying statement of
shareholders equity. In November 2001, we entered into a
$06million promissory note with Plan + Design Netcare AG.
Under the terms of the note, the entire principal amount, plus
accrued interest was due to us on January31, 2002. The
interest rate was 50% calculated on a basis of a 365-day year.
In the event of default, interest would accrue on the unpaid
balance of the note at the interest rate, plus 50%. The note
was paid in full in February 2002. In July 2002, we acquired 51% of the outstanding
shares of Detron, a newly formed corporation in The Netherlands.
We acquired the shares from Westminster, which transferred the
shares to Detron CorporationB.V. in January 2003. Detron
has certain ongoing transactions with Westminster. Under a
five-year lease agreement for office space, Detron recorded
approximately $27,000 of rent expense from the date of
acquisition to December31, 2002 and $01million for
the year ended December31, 2003. During 2002 and 2003,
Detron seconded various idle employees to Detron Telematics,
Westminsters wholly-owned subsidiary and recorded revenue
of approximately $02million for 2002 and
$03million for 2003. 6Property and

7Restructuring
Charge During the second quarter of 2002, we adopted a
restructuring plan and recorded a restructuring charge of
$100million. During the fourth quarter of 2002, we
recorded an additional $35million relating to the costs
of excess office space. The restructuring plan was in response
to the low utilization of professional employees caused by the
completion of several large fixed-price contracts and the
difficulty in obtaining new contracts as a result of the
slowdown in wireless telecommunications infrastructure spending.
The cost of the severance and associated expenses was
approximately $10million and resulted in a work force
reduction of approximately 140 people. In addition, we had
excess facility costs relative to the space occupied by the
employees affected by the reduction in force, space previously
occupied by divested operations, and reduced business use of
office space resulting from a continued trend for clients to
provide professional staff office space while performing their
services. The charge for the excess office space was
approximately $125million, which included 48 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued 15million in written-off leasehold
improvements and other assets related to the excess space. The
facility charge equals the existing lease obligation, less the
anticipated rental receipts to be received from existing and
potential subleases. This charge required significant judgments
about the length of time that space will remain vacant,
anticipated cost escalators and operating costs associated with
the leases, market rate of the subleased space, and broker fees
or other costs necessary to market the space. As of
December31, 2003, the restructuring charge calculation
assumes we will receive $107million in sublease income,
of which $51million is committed. During the first quarter of 2003, we reversed
excess severance payable of approximately $02million.
During the third quarter of 2003, we reoccupied a portion of our
office space in McLean, Virginia and reversed $04million
of the payable and recorded an increase in the restructuring
payable of $05 million related to an estimated increase in the
time period expected to sublease space in our London office. A reconciliation of the restructuring activities

8Recovery of
Receivables On March28, 2001, the United States
Bankruptcy Court, District of Maryland, Northern Division,
entered an order confirming the Amended Joint Plan of
Reorganization Under Chapter11 the Plan for
DCR PCS, Inc. DCR and Pocket Communications, Inc.
Pocket. The Plan provided that our claim against
DCR would be allowed in the amount of $50million. We
received payment of $50million on 49 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued April11, 2001 which has been recognized as
a recovery of a bad debt during 2001 and was recorded as a
reduction in general and administrative expense. The Plan also
provided that our general unsecured claim against Pocket would
be allowed. We received $16million on May23, 2002
as final settlement for the Pocket claim and was recognized as a
recovery of bad debt and as a reduction in general and
administrative expense during 2002. Both receivables had been
written off in prior years. During 1997, we recorded a charge for receivables
due from a Malaysian corporation. On March15, 2001, we
received payment of $21million, net of taxes withheld at
the source of $04million, as complete settlement on these
balances after the Malaysian Corporation successfully emerged
from bankruptcy. This amount has been recognized as a recovery
of bad debt during 2001 and was recorded as a reduction in
general and administrative expense. During 2003, we received $21million from a
customer in Algeria that had been previously reserved during
2002. The amount was recorded as a recovery of bad debt and as a
reduction in general and administrative expense. 9Impairment of
Investments and Business Disposals In June 2000, we acquired 182% of Mobilocity,
Inc. Mobilocity, which was subsequently diluted to
less than 3% as Mobilocity continued to raise additional
capital. During 2002, we evaluated our investment in Mobilocity
to determine if an impairment loss had occurred. Mobilocity had
implemented a voluntary liquidation plan, leading us to
determine the investment was likely not recoverable and recorded
a $05million impairment charge in other income and
expense. We invested a total of $46million
$29million in August 2000 and $17million in
February 2001 in Plan + Design Netcare AG PDN for
a 150% interest. PDN, and its operating subsidiary, filed for
insolvency protection in 2002. During 2002, we evaluated this
investment and determined that the investment was likely not
recoverable and recorded a $46million impairment charge
in other income and expense. On October23, 2002 we entered into a sale
agreement to convey 820% of our ownership interest in our
Egyptian subsidiary, LCC Egypt Ltd., with put options to convey
the remaining 180% ownership interest upon the resolution of
certain items. This subsidiary was established to execute a
contract for a customer, which is substantially complete. The
sale agreement anticipated that the new owner would collect
receivable balances and resolve vendor, tax, and other
obligations of the subsidiary, during the four-week period from
the agreement date. As part of the agreement we assumed specific
payroll and other obligations and agreed to make contributions
to the subsidiary requiring payments of approximately
$03million during the fourth quarter of 2002, and an
additional $02million in February 2003. In December 2002,
we recorded a recovery for provisions that were no longer needed
for operations in Egypt of $11million. This recovery was
recorded in other income and expense in the accompanying 2002
consolidated statement of operations. 10Investments In September 1999, we acquired 199% of
Tecnosistemi S.p.A. formerly, Italtel Sistemi, S.p.A. for
$11million. Tecnosistemi is an Italian telecommunications
services company. We applied the equity method to account for
our investment in Tecnosistemi until September 2000, when our
ownership interest was diluted to 94% as a result of a merger.
From the date of acquisition until September30, 2000,
Tecnosistemi incurred cumulative losses of $34million. We
recorded our $08million pro-rata share of these losses in
other income expense. Subsequent to September 2000, when our
ownership interest was diluted, the investment was accounted for
using the cost method. In July 2001, we sold all of our shares
in Tecnosistemi for $14million, resulting in a gain of
approximately $10million, which is recorded in other
income in the accompanying 2001 consolidated statement of
operations. 50 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued We held 1,666,666 shares of ClassB Common
Stock of NextWave Telecom, Inc. NextWave Telecom
which is the parent corporation of NextWave Personal
Communications Inc. We acquired the shares of NextWave Telecom
in May 1996 for a purchase price of $50million in
connection with a series of transactions entered into between
NextWave Telecom and us under an agreement dated March12,
1996 the March Agreement. We also acquired
warrants to purchase an additional 123,356 shares of
ClassB Common Stock at $300 per share. Under the March
Agreement, NextWave Telecom agreed to use us to provide not less
than a$140million of radio frequency engineering
services and b$350million of system deployment
services. These services were to be provided in increments of
20% each year during the five-year period following the
execution of the March Agreement. NextWave Telecom filed for
bankruptcy protection on December23, 1998. The March
Agreement has not been assumed or rejected by NextWave Telecom
in the bankruptcy proceeding. We did not carry any assets or
liabilities on our books relating to our equity investment in
NextWave, any pre-petition debts due us, or the March Agreement;
these balances were written off in previous years. The total amount of pre-petition debt owed to us
by NextWave Telecom and certain of its subsidiaries
collectively, NextWave was approximately $143
million, plus post-petition interest thereon. This amount
included our interest, amounting to approximately
$07million plus post-petition interest thereon, in a
general unsecured claim against NextWave that was acquired by us
in connection with our acquisition of Koll Telecommunications
LLC in 1997 the Koll Claim. In September 2001, we sold all of our 1,666,666
shares of ClassB common stock and our pre-petition debt
claims excluding a 925% interest in pre-petition interest that
may be payable with respect to the claims, the
Pre-Petition Interest Amount against NextWave
Telecom resulting in a gain of $214million, which equaled
the proceeds from the sale. The gain was recorded in other
income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
The September 2001 sale of current pre-petition debt excluded
athe Koll Claim, bany claims resulting from the
assumption or rejection of the March Agreement, and cthe
Pre-Petition Interest Amount. In February 2003, we sold our
interest in the Pre-Petition Interest Amount for
$10million in cash, which was paid in March 2003. 11Business
Combinations On December5, 2001, we acquired Transmast
Italia S.R.L. which we renamed LCC Italia S.R.L. LCC
Italia for approximately $08million in cash. LCC
Italia is a wireless infrastructure, deployment, civil
engineering and project management firm located in Milan, Italy.
The acquisition is accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting. The acquisition cost was allocated to net tangible
assets and goodwill. The net tangible assets acquired consisted
primarily of fixed assets and current assets net of assumed
liabilities. On January31, 2002, we acquired all of the
assets of Smith Woolley Telecom which we renamed LCC Deployment
Services UK, Limited LCC Deployment Services. LCC
Deployment Services is a telecommunications consultancy company
that specializes in the provision of search, acquisition,
design, build, management and maintenance services to the
wireless industry in the United Kingdom. LCC Deployment Services
is based in Cambridge, England, with several regional offices.
The purchase price of the acquisition was approximately
$86million consisting of $71million in cash and
approximately 215,000 shares of LCC ClassA common stock,
par value $001 per share. The value of the LCC ClassA
common stock was approximately $15million and was based
on the closing price on January31, 2002 of $708 per
share. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting and, therefore, LCC Deployment
Services results have been included in the consolidated
financial statements since the date of acquisition. We finalized the allocation of the purchase price
to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for this
acquisition with the assistance of an outside valuation firm.
The net assets acquired and liabilities assumed amounted to
$07million. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition
amounted to $59million. Other intangible assets acquired
amounted to $20million. Other intangible assets,
including contract backlog, customer 51 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued relationships, and the Smith Woolley trade name,
are amortized over two to five years depending on the estimated
remaining useful lives. In 2003, we wrote off the
$05million unamortized balance of intangible cost for the
Smith Woolley trade name acquired in the acquisition because we
ceased to use the name. On July9, 2002, we acquired 51% of the
outstanding shares of Detron, a newly formed corporation
organized under the laws of The Netherlands. Detron specializes
in the provision of deployment, management and maintenance
services to the wireless industry in The Netherlands. We
acquired the shares from Westminster for an initial purchase
price of $19million. Also included in the acquisition
cost were legal and transaction costs of $04million. The
purchase agreement provided for the payment of an additional
$05million should Detron achieve certain objectives by
the end of the calendar year as confirmed by its adopted annual
accounts. Having determined that these objectives were achieved,
we agreed upon the payment of the second purchase price by way
of aassignment of an intercompany note receivable from
Detron to the sellers in the amount of approximately $02
million and bthe payment in cash of approximately
$03million. The payment in cash to Westminster was made
in May 2003 in accordance with the deed of the assignment
agreement. The acquisition has been recorded under the
purchase method of accounting, and therefore Detrons
results have been included in the consolidated financial
statements since the date of acquisition. Goodwill recognized in
the acquisition amounted to $25million. Other intangible
assets acquired amounted to $05million. Other intangible
assets, including backlog, customer relationships, and the
Detron trade name, are amortized over two to five years
depending on the estimated remaining useful lives. Goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite
useful lives were evaluated at December31, 2002 and 2003
for possible impairment under the provisions of SFAS
No142. We concluded that no adjustment was necessary at
year-end and will continue to evaluate for possible impairment
annually. We recognized $06million and
$12million, respectively, in amortization expense for the
intangible assets with definite useful lives from the date of
acquisition through 2002 and for the year ended
December31, 2003. We expect amortization expense on the

On August4, 2003, through our wholly owned
subsidiary LCC China Services, L.L.C., we closed an investment
in a newly created entity based in China, Beijing LCC Bright
Oceans Communication Consulting Co. Ltd. LCC/
BOCO. We contributed approximately $11million for
a 490% share of LCC/ BOCOs registered capital. Bright
Oceans Inter-Telecom Corporation, a Chinese publicly traded
network management and systems integrator BOCO,
contributed approximately $11million to hold the
remaining 510% of LCC/ BOCOs registered capital. Our
capital contribution was to be paid in three equal installments
of approximately $357,000 each and the first installment was
made on the date of closing. The second installment was made in
October 2003. The third installment was made in January 2004.
LCC/ BOCO offers design, deployment and maintenance services to
wireless carriers in China. We account for our investment in
LCC/ BOCO using the equity method of accounting. We recorded an
equity loss of $01million to reflect its proportionate
share of LCC/ BOCOs losses through December31, 2003. 12Line of
Credit In 2003, Detron established a line of credit with
NMB-HellerN.V. NMB. The line of credit
provides that NMB will provide credit to Detron in the form of
advance payments collateralized by Detrons outstanding
receivables. The agreement provides for NMB to advance up to 75%
of the receivable balance. There is no maximum on the amount of
receivables Detron can assign to NMB. Detron must repay the
advances from NMB within 90days or upon customer payment
whichever occurs first. Interest on the advance payments will be
calculated at a rate equal to NMBs overdraft base rate
plus 2% subject to a minimum of 575% per year. The agreement
has an initial term of two years and can be extended. As of
December31, 2003 Detron had $18million at an
interest rate of 575% outstanding under the credit facility. 53 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND

At December31, 2003, we had foreign tax
credits for U.S. tax purposes of $30million, which expire
between 2003 and 2005, a research and development credit of
$03million and an alternative minimum tax credit of
$05million. We had U.S. operating loss carry-forwards of
$39million, which expire in 2024. We also had
$131million of foreign operating loss carry-forwards from
operations, which expire between 2006 and 2009. Foreign income tax expense is generated from
business conducted in countries where we have subsidiaries or
have established branch offices or have performed significant
services that constitute a permanent establishment
for tax reporting purposes. In determining the tax valuation allowance,
management considers if it is likely that some portion of the
deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of
future taxable income during the periods in which those
temporary differences become deductible. Management considers
the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected
future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this
assessment. A valuation allowance has been provided for deferred
tax assets which management does not believe are more likely
than not to be realized, primarily consisting of foreign net
operating losses carried forward, foreign tax credits before
they expire and non-cash compensation expense that may not
become deductible for tax purposes. 55 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued 14Health and
Retirement Plans We have a defined contribution profit sharing
plan under Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code that
provides for voluntary employee contributions of 10% to 600%
of compensation for substantially all employees. We make a
matching contribution of 500% of an employees
contribution up to 60% of each employees compensation.
Company contributions and other expenses associated with the
plan were approximately $07million, $05million,
and $04million for the years ended December31,
2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Our subsidiary, LCC UK Ltd., has a defined
contribution pension plan under Chapter1 Part XIV of the
Income and Corporation Taxes Act, 1988. The plan provides for
voluntary employee contributions of 10% to 50% of an
employees base salary. It is available to all full-time
employees who have completed their three-month probation period.
We contribute 50% of an employees base salary and match
the employees contribution up to 50%. LCC UK Ltd.,
contributions and other expenses related to the plan were
approximately $02million, $02million, and
$01million for the years ended December31, 2001,
2002 and 2003, respectively. LCC Italia has two statutory defined contribution
pension plans and one voluntary plan for directors of LCC
Italia. The contributions are in accordance with the National
Contract Agreement. LCC Italia contributions and related
expenses to the plans were approximately $04million and
$09million for the years ended December31, 2002 and
2003. We are self-insured for group health benefits and
claims up to $01million in stop loss coverage. 15Incentive
Plans At December31, 2001, 2002, and 2003, we had
two stock-based incentive plans, an employee stock purchase plan
and an employee stock option plan, which are described below. No
compensation cost has been recognized for our fixed stock option
plans and employee stock purchase plan. Pro forma information regarding net income
lossand net income loss per share for stock options
under the fair value method of SFAS123 is described in
Note2. The per share weighted-average fair value of stock
options granted during 2001, 2002 and 2003 was $793, $191, and
$153 respectively, on the date of grant using the Black Scholes

We established our Employee Stock Purchase Plan
in 1997, which authorizes the issuance of up to 860,000 shares
of classA common stock pursuant to the plan. The Employee
Stock Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to elect to have
a portion of their pay deducted by our company in order to
purchase shares of classA common stock. Rights to purchase
shares are deemed granted to participating employees as of the
beginning of each applicable period, as specified by the
Compensation and Stock Option Committee of our board of
directors. The purchase price for each share is not less than
85% of the fair market value of the share of classA common
stock on the first or last trading day of such period, whichever
is lower. Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, we issued
102,530 shares in 2001, 34,565 shares in 2002, and 31,779 shares
in 2003 to employees upon the exercise of options held by such
employees. Compensation cost of approximately $127,000, $11,000,
and $15,000, respectively, would have been recognized under SFAS
No123 for the fair value of the employees purchase
rights and is included in the pro forma net income

The weighted average fair value of the purchase
rights granted in 2001, 2002, and 2003 was $123, $032, and
$050, respectively. In connection with our initial public offering,
we established the 1996 Employee Stock Option Plan, which
currently authorizes the issuance of up to 8,825,000 shares of
classA common stock pursuant to options granted under the
plan. Also in connection with our initial public
offering, we established the 1996 Directors Stock Option Plan
Directors Plan. The Directors Plan currently
authorizes the issuance of up to 250,000 shares of classA
common stock. The Directors Plan provides that directors are
entitled to receive options to purchase shares of classA
common stock in an amount determined at the discretion of the
board of directors. The Directors Plan also provides for annual
grants of options to purchase up to 250,000 shares of
classB common stock to directors who are eligible to hold
such shares. However, pursuant to the terms of the Directors
Plan, the final annual grant of such options occurred in 2000.
Options granted to directors eligible to hold classB
common stock expire no later than the fifth anniversary of the
date of grant and options granted to directors who are not
eligible to hold classB common stock expire no later than
the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. Our directors are
also entitled to receive option grants under the 1996 Employee
Stock Option Plan in an amount determined at the discretion of
the board of directors. On October17, 2001, we offered to exchange
all eligible outstanding options under the Amended and Restated
LCC International, Inc. 1996 Employee Stock Option Plan the
1996 Plan for new options we granted under the 1996
Plan on May21, 2002. Eligible outstanding options were all
options with an exercise price of $1050 or more that were held
by an employee other than our Chief Executive Officer. We
granted an option to purchase one share of our classA
common stock for every option to purchase two shares tendered
and accepted for exchange. The terms of the new options other
than the exercise price are substantially the same as the terms
of the options tendered for exchange. Our offer to exchange
expired on November20, 2001 and eligible employees had
tendered 1,460,250 options on that date. In exchange for the
options tendered, we granted 592,619 new options on May21,
2002 with an exercise price of $296, which is equal to the
closing price of our classA common stock on the business
day immediately preceding the date we granted the new options. 57 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND

Commitments We lease office facilities and certain equipment,
principally in the United States, under operating leases
expiring on various dates over the next twelve years. The lease
agreements include renewal options and provisions for rental
escalations based on the Consumer Price Index and require us to
pay for executory costs such as taxes and insurance. The lease
agreements also allow us to elect an early out provision by
giving notice and paying certain lease termination penalties. Benefits associated with a rent abatement period
and certain lease incentives for office facilities are reflected
ratably over the period of the lease. For leases that have been
terminated, the applicable portion of the benefit has been
offset against the lease termination penalty. 58 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND

and Contingencies We are party to various legal proceedings and

Loss Per Share Income lossper share is presented on both
a basic and diluted basis in accordance with the provisions of
FASB Statement No128, Earnings per
Share SFAS No128. Basic earnings
per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income
available to common stockholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings
per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other contracts to issue common stock were
exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the
issuance of common stock that shared in our earnings. The
reconciliations of the basic and diluted earnings per share
computations for the years ended December31, 2001, 2002

Under SFAS No128, options that have an
anti-dilutive effect or that reduce the loss per share should be
excluded from the computation of diluted earnings. As a result,
options to purchase 38million, 44million and
44million shares of ClassA Common Stock outstanding
during the years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003,
respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share because the effect would have had an
anti-dilutive effect. 59 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued 19Segment
Reporting SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information established
standards for reporting information about the operating segments
in interim and annual financial reports issued to stockholders.
It also established standards for related disclosures about
products and services and geographic areas. Operating segments
are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate
financial information is available that is evaluated regularly
by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group,
in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.
Our chief operating decision-making group is the Executive
Committee, which comprises the Chief Executive Officer and our
senior vice presidents. Our operating segments are defined geographically
by region, the Americas region and the EMEA region. Both regions
provide design and deployment services, operations and
maintenance services and technical consulting services. The accounting policies of the operating segments
are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies. We evaluate performance based on stand
alone operating segment profit or loss from operations before
income taxes not including nonrecurring gains and losses, and
generally accounts for intersegment sales and transfers as if
the sales or transfers were to third parties at current market
prices. Interdivisional transactions are eliminated in
consolidation. Revenues are attributed to geographic areas based
on the location of the assignment. 60 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
