REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of CommScope,Inc. We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CommScope,Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, comprehensive income loss and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004. Our audits also
included the consolidated financial statement schedule listed in the Index at . These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and related financial statement schedule based on our audits. We did not audit the financial statements
of OFS BrightWave, LLC, the Company investment which was accounted for by use of the equity method as of and for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002. The Company net investment in
and advances to OFS BrightWave, LLC at December31, 2003 of $13361million and the Company share of OFS BrightWave, LLC net losses of $61745million and
$53722million for the years ended December2003 and 2002, respectively, are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The financial statements of OFS BrightWave,
LLC were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for such company, is based solely on the report of such other
auditors. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In
our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
CommScope,Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such consolidated financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of the Company internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March14, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting. s/

CommScope, Inc.      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements      In Thousands, Unless Otherwise Noted    
1.BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS 
CommScope,Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries CommScope or the Company is a world leader in the design and manufacture of cable and connectivity
solutions for communications networks. The Company focuses on the 'last mile' in communications networks, which is the distribution access, or final link to the customer. Through the acquisition of
substantially all of the assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of the Connectivity Solutions business Connectivity Solutions of AvayaInc. Avaya as of January31, 2004
see Note3, the Company became a global leader in structured cabling for business enterprise applications. The Company believes it is a global leader in broadband coaxial cables for the cable
television industry. The Company also designs, manufactures and markets a broad line of high-performance electronic, coaxial and fiber optic cable products for data networking, Internet
access, wireless communication, telephony and other broadband applications. In addition, the Company is a leading provider of environmentally secure enclosures and structured cabling solutions
supporting central offices for telecommunication service providers in the United States. 
2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of Consolidation 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include CommScope and its wholly owned subsidiaries. CommScope consolidated results of operations for the
year ended December31, 2004 include the results of operations of Connectivity Solutions from January31, 2004, the date of the Connectivity Solutions acquisition, through
December31, 2004 see Note3. In addition, CommScope consolidated results of operations for the year ended December31, 2004 include the results of operations of OFS
BrightWave, LLC OFS BrightWave for the period from January1, 2004 to June14, 2004, the date CommScope disposed of its equity interest in OFS BrightWave see Note5. All
material intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2004 presentation. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents represent amounts on deposit in banks and cash invested temporarily in various instruments with a maturity of three months or less at
the time of purchase. 
Short-term Investments 
The Company short-term investments consist of marketable debt securities that are designated as available for sale and recorded at fair value.
Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. As of December31, 2004 and 2003, all
such investments were variable rate instruments and there were no unrealized gains or losses. Short-term investments totaling $957million as of December31, 2003, which were previously
recorded as cash and cash equivalents due to their liquidity and pricing reset feature, have been reported as short-term investments to conform to current year presentation. This change in
classification has no effect on total current assets, total assets, net income or net cash provided by operating activities of the Company. 
43  Short-term
investments are regularly reviewed for impairment, based on criteria that include the extent to which the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the duration of
the market decline, the Company ability and intent to hold the investment to its expected recovery and the financial strength of the issuer of the security. As of December31, 2004 and 2003,
there were no investment securities that were considered impaired. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory cost is determined on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis for the
Company domestic inventories. Inventory cost is determined on an average cost basis for certain of the Company foreign inventories, representing 25% and 100% of the Company foreign inventory at
December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Inventory cost for the remainder of the Company foreign inventories at December31, 2004 is determined on a FIFO basis. The Company maintains
reserves to reduce the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market, including reserves for excess and obsolete inventory. 
Long-Lived Assets 
Property, Plant and Equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, including interest costs associated with qualifying capital additions. Provisions for depreciation are based on
estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line and accelerated methods. Useful lives generally range from 10 to 35years for buildings and improvements and 3 to
10years for machinery and equipment. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, CommScope ceased amortization of goodwill
and other purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition less accumulated
amortization. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets see Note4. 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
In accordance with SFAS No142, goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or at other times if events have
occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of these intangibles may no longer by recoverable. The Company performs these annual impairment evaluations as of August31.
Based on these annual impairment evaluations, no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives was identified during 2004, 2003 or 2002. Property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the
assets may not be recoverable, based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets. Assets identified as being impaired are carried at fair
value. Assets that 
44  management
intends to dispose of are carried at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Income Taxes 
Deferred income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Investment tax
credits are recorded using the flow-through method. The Company records a valuation allowance, when appropriate, to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to
be realized. 
The
Company had no cumulative net undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries as of December31, 2004. In addition, the Company does not provide for taxes related to the
foreign currency transaction gains and losses on its long-term intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries. These loans are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future and the
foreign currency gains and losses are therefore recorded on a pretax basis to accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
Revenue Recognition 
The Company primary source of revenues is from product sales to distributors, cable television system operators, telecommunications service providers and
Original Equipment Manufacturers OEMs. Service revenue from delivery of products shipped by Company owned trucks was not material to the Company reported sales during 2004, 2003 or 2002. Revenue
from sales of the Company products shipped by nonaffiliated carriers and by Company owned trucks is recognized at the time the goods are delivered to the customer and title
passes, provided the earnings process is complete, the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer and revenue is measurable. 
For
all arrangements, revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances, returns and rebates. In addition, accruals are
established for price protection programs with distributors at the time the related revenue is recognized. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical
experience, contract terms, inventory levels in the distributor channel and other related factors. 
Product Warranties 
The Company recognizes a liability for the estimated claims that may be paid under its customer warranty agreements to remedy potential deficiencies of quality or
performance of the Company products. These product warranties extend over periods ranging from one to twenty-five years from the date of sale, depending upon the product subject to the
warranty. The Company records a provision for estimated future warranty claims as cost of sales based upon the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales and specifically identified warranty
issues. The Company bases its estimates on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates, as appropriate, when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that revisions may be necessary. 
45  Shipping and Handling Costs 
CommScope includes shipping and handling costs billed to customers in net sales and includes the costs incurred to transport the shipment of product to customers
as cost of sales. Certain internal handling costs, which relate to activities to prepare goods for shipment, are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense and were approximately
$22million in 2004, $28million in 2003 and $34million in 2002. 
Advertising Costs 
Advertising costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Advertising expense was $25million in 2004, $18million in 2003 and
$17million in 2002. Research and Development Costs 
Research and development RD costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. RD costs include materials, equipment and facilities that have no
alternative future use, depreciation on equipment and facilities currently used for RD purposes, personnel costs, contract services and reasonable allocations of indirect costs, if clearly related to
an RD activity. Expenditures in the pre-production phase of an RD project are recorded as RD expense. However, costs incurred in the pre-production phase that are associated
with output actually used in production are recorded in cost of sales. A project is considered finished with pre-production efforts when management determines that it has achieved
acceptable levels of scrap and yield, which vary by project. Expenditures related to ongoing production are recorded in cost of sales. 
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
CommScope is exposed to various risks resulting from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. CommScope
risk management strategy includes the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments as hedges of these risks, whenever management determines their use to be reasonable and
practical. This strategy does not permit the use of derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, nor does it allow for speculation. A hedging instrument may be designated as a net investment
hedge to manage exposure to foreign currency risks related to an investment in a foreign subsidiary, a fair value hedge to manage exposure to risks related to a firm commitment for the purchase of raw
materials or a foreign-currency-
denominated firm commitment for the purchase of equipment, or a cash flow hedge to manage exposure to risks related to a forecasted purchase of raw materials, variable interest rate payments or a
forecasted foreign-currency-denominated sale of product. The use of non-derivative financial instruments in hedging activities is limited to hedging fair value risk related to a foreign-
currency-denominated firm commitment or a foreign currency risk related to a net investment in a foreign subsidiary. The
Company risk management strategy permits the reasonable and practical use of derivative hedging instruments such as forward contracts, options, cross currency swaps, certain
interest rate swaps, caps and floors, and non-derivative hedging instruments such as foreign-currency-denominated loans. The Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments as
assets and liabilities and measures them at fair value. All hedging instruments are designated and documented as either a fair 
46  value
hedge, a cash flow hedge or a net investment hedge at inception. For fair value hedges, the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is recognized currently in earnings. To the extent
the fair value hedging relationship is effective, the change in fair value of the hedged item is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognized currently in
earnings. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax, and is
recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Any ineffectiveness of a cash flow hedge is recognized currently in earnings. For net investment hedges, the effective portion
of the change in fair value of a derivative instrument, or the change in carrying amount of a non-derivative instrument, is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net
of tax, and is recognized in the income statement only if there is a substantially complete liquidation of the investment in the foreign subsidiary. Any ineffectiveness of a net investment hedge is
recognized currently in earnings. The effectiveness of designated hedging relationships is tested and documented on at least a quarterly basis. At December31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had
one hedging relationship, which involved the use of a derivative financial instrument. See Note13 for further disclosure related to derivative instruments and hedging activities. The
Company has elected and documented the use of the normal purchases and sales exception for normal purchase and sales contracts that meet the definition of a derivative financial
instrument. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
Approximately 32% of the Company 2004 sales were to customers located outside the U.S. Although the Company primarily bills customers in foreign countries in
U.S. dollars, a portion of these sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, particularly sales from the Company foreign subsidiaries. The financial position and results of
operations of certain of the Company foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Revenues and expenses of
these subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries have been translated at the rates of
exchange as of the balance sheet date. Translation gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
Aggregate
foreign currency transaction gains and losses of the Company and its subsidiaries, such as those resulting from the settlement of foreign receivables or payables and
short-term intercompany advances, were recorded to other income expense, in the statement of operations and were not material to the results of the Company operations during 2004, 2003
or 2002. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to long-term intercompany loans that are not expected to be settled in the foreseeable future are recorded to accumulated
other comprehensive loss. 
The
Eurodollar Credit Agreement see Note12, which was designated and effective as a partial hedge of the Company net investment in its Belgian subsidiary prior to its
termination on December2, 2002, was translated at the rate of exchange as of the termination date. The transaction gains and losses recognized during the term of this loan, and on the
termination date, were recorded, net of tax, to accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
47  Net Income Loss Per Share 
Basic net income loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable
periods. Diluted net income loss per share is based on net income loss adjusted for after-tax interest and amortization of debt issuance costs related to convertible debt, if dilutive,
divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock options and convertible securities.

As of December31, 2004, the Company had one stock-based employee compensation plan see Note16. The Company accounts for this plan under the
intrinsic value method recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations. No
stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income loss, as all options granted under this plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of grant.

following table illustrates the effect on net income loss and net income loss per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123,

December2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued a revised accounting standard related to share-based payments to employees for compensation and
nonemployees for payments for products and/or services. The revised standard supersedes APB Opinion No25 and will require fair value accounting for stock option plans. The accounting standard
is effective for periods beginning after June15, 2005 and is more fully discussed within this Note under the section titled Impact of Newly Issued Accounting Standards. Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the Financial Statements 
The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and their underlying assumptions form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other objective sources. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and
on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates, as appropriate, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary.
Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Company financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts; reserves for sales returns, discounts, allowances and rebates and
distributor price protection reserves; inventory excess and obsolescence reserves; product warranty reserves; income tax valuation allowances; impairment reviews for investments, fixed assets,
goodwill and other intangibles; pension and postretirement benefit costs; and fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of Connectivity Solutions. Although these
estimates are based on management knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management assumptions about future events, it is at least reasonably possible that they may
ultimately differ materially from actual results. 
49  Concentrations of Risk 
Non-derivative financial instruments used by the Company in the normal course of business include letters of credit and commitments to extend credit,
primarily accounts receivable. These financial instruments involve risk, including the credit risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to those instruments, and the maximum potential loss may
exceed the reserves provided in the Company balance sheet. See Note20 for further discussion of customer-related concentrations of risk. 
The
Company manages its exposures to credit risk associated with accounts receivable through credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures. CommScope estimates the allowance
for doubtful accounts based on the actual payment history and individual circumstances of significant customers as well as the age of receivables. In management opinion, the Company did not have
significant unreserved risk of credit loss due to the nonperformance of customers or other counterparties related to amounts receivable. However, an adverse change in financial condition of a
significant customer or group of customers or in the telecommunications industry could materially affect the Company estimates related to doubtful accounts. The
principal raw materials purchased by CommScope fabricated aluminum, plastics and other polymers, bimetals, copper and optical fiber are subject to changes in market price as these
materials are linked to the commodity markets. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks through effective requirements planning and by working closely with its key suppliers to obtain the best
possible pricing and delivery terms. 
Impact of Newly Issued Accounting Standards 
In April2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP No. FAS129-1, Disclosure Requirements under FASB Statement No129,
Disclosure of Information about Capital Structure, Relating to Contingently Convertible Securities. This FSP interprets how the disclosure provisions of SFAS No129 apply to contingently
convertible securities and to their potentially dilutive effects on net income loss per share. The guidance in this FSP was effective immediately and applies to all existing and newly created
securities. Management believes the Company disclosures comply with the requirements of this FSP. 
In
June2004, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003. This FSP provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act for employers that
sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits. The FSP states that if the benefits provided by a plan are actuarially equivalent to Medicare PartD, measures
of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost on or after the date of enactment should reflect the effects of the Act. It also requires employers to
provide certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the Act. The Company implemented this FSP on a prospective basis as of July1, 2004 see Note14. 
In
October2004, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF on Issue No04-8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible
Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share. Issue No04-8 requires that all instruments that have embedded conversion features that are 
50  contingent
on market conditions indexed to an issuer share price be included in diluted net income per share if dilutive regardless of whether the market conditions have been met. This consensus
was effective for the year ended December31, 2004. Issue No04-8 applies retroactively to instruments outstanding at the date of adoption of this consensus and requires
prior period diluted net income per share amounts to be restated to conform to this consensus. The Company believes its 1% convertible senior subordinated debentures issued in March2004 are
subject to the requirements of Issue No04-8 see section titled Net Income Loss Per Share within this Note and Note22. 
In
November2004, the FASB issued SFAS No151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No43, Chapter 4. This Statement is the result of efforts to converge U.S.
accounting standards for inventories with International Accounting Standards. SFAS No151 requires that items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, and rehandling costs be
recognized as expenses in the current period. It also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS
No151 is effective on a prospective basis for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005, though earlier adoption is permitted. The Company does not
anticipate that the application of SFAS No151 will have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial position. 
In
December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123 revised, Share-Based Payment, which establishes standards related to the accounting for transactions in which an entity
exchanges its equity instrument for goods or services. This revised standard also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the
fair value of the entity equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of these equity instruments. SFAS No123 focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an
entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. This standard requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity
instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognize the cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. This
standard is effective for periods beginning after June15, 2005. CommScope believes that this statement will have a material impact on its consolidated statement of operations. The pro forma
effects on net income loss and net income loss per share related to the application of this standard had CommScope applied fair value recognition provisions for the years ended December31,
2004, 2003 and 2002 are reported within this Note under the section titled Stock Options. 3.ACQUISITION OF CONNECTIVITY SOLUTIONS 
Effective January31, 2004, CommScope completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Connectivity
Solutions. The total purchase price consisted of approximately $250million in cash and approximately 18million shares of CommScope common stock. These shares were valued at
$324million on the closing date, based on the five-day average market price of CommScope common stock beginning on the second trading day prior to the closing date and ending on
the third trading day after the closing date. Additional paid-in-capital was reduced by a $05million accrual for estimated registration costs related to the issuance
of the common shares to fund the acquisition. CommScope assumed certain current liabilities and approximately $65million of other specified liabilities, primarily related to employee benefits.
The cash portion of the purchase price 
51  consisted
of $150million from CommScope existing cash balances and $100million from borrowing under a new senior secured credit facility see Note12. 
The
Company acquired Connectivity Solutions primarily to expand the Company position in the 'last mile' of telecommunications, establish a leadership position in the global enterprise
connectivity market and enhance the Company global growth opportunities. The Connectivity Solutions segment is a designer, manufacturer and marketer of physical layer
end-to-end structured cabling solutions and integrated cabinet solutions supporting local area network LAN applications for enterprises and telecommunications service
providers. 
The
Company prepared a preliminary estimate of the fair values assigned to each major asset and liability category of Connectivity Solutions as of the January31, 2004 closing
date. This preliminary estimate has been updated to reflect post-closing adjustments to the purchase price, in accordance with the terms of the asset purchase agreement entered into with
Avaya in connection with the acquisition of the Connectivity Solutions business, and a revised purchase price allocation based on new information related to estimates of the fair values of certain
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. As of
January 31, 2004

The
values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets reflected above have been adjusted for the pro rata allocation based on their relative fair values of the excess of
the fair value of acquired net assets over the cost of the acquisition of Connectivity Solutions. 
Intangible
assets reflected above were determined by management to meet the criteria for recognition apart from goodwill and include the following: Estimated Fair

have been determined by management to have indefinite lives and will not be amortized, based on management expectation that the trademarked products will generate cash flows
for the Company for an indefinite period. Management expects to maintain usage of trademarks on existing products and introduce new products in the future that will also display the trademarks, thus
extending their lives indefinitely. 
In-process
research and development assets were written off and reflected in the Company statement of operations during 2004. Management believed that the assets under
development had no alternative future use as of the date of the third party valuation of this intangible asset, resulting in its immediate write-off. 
The
amortizable intangible assets reflected in the table above were determined by management to have finite lives. The useful life for the developed technologies for internal use was
based on review of historical lives of similar products, in conjunction with technology-specific factors and anticipated future trends in the industry. The useful life for the developed technologies
for external use was based on the remaining lives of the related patents. The useful life for the customer base was based on management forecasts of customer turnover. The useful life for the
favorable contracts was based on the remaining terms of the contracts. The useful life of the other intangible assets was based on management estimate of the remaining useful life, considering the
age of the underlying assets and review of historical lives of similar products. 
CommScope
consolidated results of operations for the year ended December31, 2004 include the results of operations of the Connectivity Solutions segment for the eleven-month
period from February1, 2004 through December31, 2004. The following table presents pro forma consolidated results of operations for CommScope for the years ended December31,
2004 and 2003, as though the acquisition of Connectivity Solutions had been completed as of the beginning of each period. This pro forma information is intended to provide information regarding how
CommScope might have looked if 
53  the
acquisition had occurred as of the dates indicated. The amounts for the Connectivity Solutions business of Avaya included in this pro forma information for the year ended December31, 2003
and the month of January2004 are based on the historical results of the Connectivity Solutions business as a division of Avaya and, therefore, may not be indicative of the actual results of
the Connectivity Solutions segment when operated as part of CommScope. Moreover, the pro forma information does not reflect all of the changes that may result from the acquisition, including, but not
limited to, challenges of transition, integration and restructuring associated with the transaction; challenges of achieving anticipated synergies; ability to retain qualified employees and existing
business alliances; maintaining satisfactory relationships with represented employees; and customer demand for Connectivity Solutions segment products. The pro forma adjustments represent management
best estimates based on information available at the time the pro forma information was prepared and may differ from the adjustments that may actually have been required. Accordingly, the pro forma
financial information should not be relied upon as being indicative of the historical results that would have been realized had the acquisition occurred as of the dates indicated or that may be
achieved in the future. Unaudited Pro Forma

expense, depreciation, amortization and related income taxes. These pro forma results also include $473million of corporate overhead costs allocated by Avaya to the Connectivity Solutions
business during the year ended December31, 2003. The pro forma results for the year ended December31, 2004 include an estimate of $40million for corporate overhead costs that
would have been allocated by Avaya to the Connectivity Solutions business during January2004. During the eleven-month period from February1, 2004 through December31, 2004,
CommScope incurred corporate overhead costs of approximately $54million on behalf of the Connectivity Solutions segment. Certain overhead costs previously incurred on behalf of and allocated
to the Connectivity Solutions business by Avaya are now being incurred directly by the Connectivity Solutions segment. 
Net
income during 2004 includes certain material charges that relate directly or indirectly to the acquisition of the Connectivity Solutions segment, as listed below on a pretax basis: Increase in cost of sales resulting from inventory purchase accounting adjustments 14,628 Acquisition-related in-process research and development charges 3,984 Acquisition-related transition and startup costs 8,289 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 5,029 Restructuring costs 14,243 54

expense for intangible assets was $122million, $25million and $25million for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Estimated amortization expense for the five succeeding years is as follows: 2005 130 2006 121 2007 65 2008 61 2009 61 The
immaterial change in goodwill for the year ended December31, 2004 was due to the impact of translating the euro-denominated goodwill on the balance sheet of the
Company Belgian subsidiary into U.S. dollars. The entire goodwill balance as of December31, 2004 is allocable to the Cable segment.

5.EQUITY INTEREST IN OFS BRIGHTWAVE, LLC 
In November2001, CommScope acquired an 184% ownership interest in OFS BrightWave, an optical fiber and fiber optic cable venture between CommScope and
The Furukawa Electric Co.,Ltd. Furukawa. OFS BrightWave was formed to operate a portion of the optical fiber and fiber optic cable business OFS Group acquired from Lucent
TechnologiesInc. Lucent. CommScope issued 102million unregistered shares of its common stock, valued at $2034million, or $1994 per share, to Lucent in lieu of a portion
of the purchase price payable by Furukawa for the acquisition of a portion of Lucent OFS Group. Of the amount paid by CommScope, $1734million represented a capital contribution in exchange
for CommScope 184% equity interest in OFS BrightWave and $30million represented a loan to OFS BrightWave. Furukawa owned the remaining 816% equity interest in OFS BrightWave. CommScope
held a contractual right to sell its ownership interest in OFS BrightWave to Furukawa for a cash payment equal to CommScope original investment in and advances to OFS BrightWave. On
October9, 2002, CommScope and Furukawa purchased 102million shares of CommScope common stock from Lucent for $53million, or $520 per share. Of the total
102million shares purchased from Lucent, Furukawa purchased approximately 77million shares for approximately $40million. CommScope repurchased the remaining approximately
25million shares, which are currently classified as treasury stock, for approximately $13million. As of December31, 2003 and 2002, Furukawa was CommScope largest
stockholder, with approximately 13% of the Company outstanding shares. CommScope funded its common stock repurchase using existing cash balances. Since a registration of the Company shares held by
Lucent was not required, CommScope wrote off the accrued costs of registration, net of the costs of completing the common stock repurchase, for a net increase in additional paid-in capital
of $546 during the year ended December31, 2002. 
In
conjunction with this stock purchase, CommScope and Furukawa agreed to change from 2004 to 2006 the date when CommScope could first exercise its contractual right to sell its
ownership interest in OFS BrightWave to Furukawa for a cash payment equal to CommScope original investment in and advances to OFS BrightWave. If CommScope exercised its contractual right to sell its
ownership interest in OFS BrightWave to Furukawa, Furukawa would have had, at that time, the right to require CommScope to purchase the 77million shares of its common stock owned by Furukawa
for an aggregate price of $458million. 
Effective
April1, 2004, Furukawa made additional equity contributions to OFS BrightWave. Since CommScope elected not to make a corresponding investment in OFS BrightWave, this
additional investment by Furukawa reduced CommScope ownership percentage in OFS BrightWave from 184% to 94%. 
Primarily
as a result of the continuing weakness in the global fiber optic cable market and Furukawa continuing efforts to restructure its OFS operations, CommScope agreed with
Furukawa to further amend their existing contractual arrangements in the second quarter of 2004 for the mutual benefit of both companies. On June14, 2004, CommScope and Furukawa changed the
period in which CommScope could exercise its contractual right to sell its ownership interest in OFS BrightWave to Furukawa from 2006 to any time on or after June14, 2004 and changed the
exercise price from $1734million in cash to the approximately 77million shares of CommScope common stock owned by Furukawa. On June14, 2004, CommScope exercised its
contractual right to sell and sold its 94% ownership interest in OFS BrightWave to Furukawa in exchange for the approximately 77million 
56  shares
of CommScope common stock owned by Furukawa, which were valued at $1323million as of the transaction date. CommScope currently holds these shares as treasury stock. As a result of this
transaction, CommScope no longer owns any equity interest in OFS BrightWave. 
This
transaction does not affect CommScope right to receive full payment from OFS BrightWave under the $30million note due in 2006, based on its original terms. Primarily due
to market conditions for optical fiber and because CommScope no longer had an equity ownership interest in OFS BrightWave, CommScope determined that there was an
other-than-temporary impairment in the carrying value of this asset as of the transaction date. Accordingly, a pretax impairment charge of $111million was recognized
as a reduction of the gain on the OFS BrightWave transaction to reduce the carrying value of the note to zero. 
The
OFS BrightWave transaction resulted in a net pretax gain of $1213million $764million after-tax or $113 per diluted share. This gain represents
1the fair value of the common stock received by CommScope in exchange for CommScope transfer of its ownership interest in OFS BrightWave to Furukawa, plus 2the realized gain from
CommScope cumulative equity method share of OFS BrightWave unrealized foreign currency translation gains previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, less 3the impairment
charge related to the $30million note receivable from OFS BrightWave. The income tax impact of this gain enabled the Company to realize its deferred tax asset related to the Company share of
the cumulative financial statement net losses of OFS BrightWave. In addition, this transaction created a capital gain for tax purposes, which allowed the Company to deduct a capital loss related to
the 2001 impairment of an investment, creating a current tax benefit of $14million from this capital loss deduction. 
Although
the Company ownership interest in OFS BrightWave was less than 20%, the investment has been accounted for using the equity method since OFS BrightWave was organized as a
limited liability company with characteristics of a partnership. CommScope portion of the losses of OFS BrightWave for the period from January1 through June14, 2004 and the years
ended December31, 2003 and 2002 were included in the consolidated financial statements of CommScope for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These results
were net of the elimination of after-tax intercompany profit in the amount of $30, $105 and $109 for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to
interest payments on the $30million note receivable. OFS BrightWave elected to be taxed as a partnership, therefore the Company income tax benefit from flow-through losses has
been recorded based on the Company tax rates. 
57  The
following table provides summary financial information for OFS BrightWave for the period from January1 through June14, 2004 and the years ended December31,

In October2004, the Board of Directors of Connectivity Solutions Manufacturing,Inc. CSMI, a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, adopted organizational and cost reduction initiatives at its Omaha, Nebraska facility in order to improve its competitive position. The initiatives include a reorganized management structure
that creates more focused stand-alone management organizations for cable, apparatus and cabinets; re-engineered, simplified business practices and manufacturing processes; and a reduced
number of management, production and support personnel. As a result of these actions, the Company recognized a pretax charge of $142million for employee-related costs during the fourth
quarter of 2004, which consisted of severance pay and related fringe benefits and a net curtailment loss; process improvement costs, which consisted of consulting and other costs associated with
modifying the manufacturing operations; and impairment charges related to equipment that is no longer used in operations. As of December31, 2004, the workforce had been reduced by
approximately 220 employees as a result of actions taken under these initiatives, and additional workforce reductions are expected to occur during the first quarter of 2005. The remaining actions
related to these initiatives are expected to be completed in the first half of 2005; therefore, the restructuring accrual balance as of December31, 2004 is classified as a current liability. 
58  The
activity within the liability for these restructuring initiatives was as follows: Employee-
Related
Costs

Improvement
Costs

Charges
Total Charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 5,859 1,574 6,810 14,243 Cash paid 1,205 1,574 2,779 Non-cash 522 6,810 7,332 Balance as of December 31, 2004 4,132 4,132 During
the first half of 2005, the Company expects to recognize additional pretax restructuring costs related to completing these initiatives of $4million to
$6million. The amount and timing of such costs will depend on issues encountered and market conditions during implementation of the plan. 
During
the first quarter of 2004, CommScope reduced the Connectivity Solutions segment workforce by approximately 45 employees. The reductions were primarily related to the Company
efforts to improve operational efficiency and reduce cost. The affected employees were employed in management and support functions at the Omaha, Nebraska facility. This workforce reduction resulted
in pretax charges of approximately $16million during the first quarter of 2004 and was partially offset by an adjustment of approximately $03million in the fourth quarter of 2004.
The net charge of approximately $13million is recorded in acquisition-related transition and startup costs and consisted of severance pay and related fringe benefits. As of
December31, 2004, there was no remaining liability related to this workforce reduction. 
During
2002, the Company recorded pretax charges related to two workforce reductions totaling approximately $25million $22million in cost of sales and
$03million in selling, general and administrative expenses. As a result of these actions, the Company workforce was reduced by 355 employees. The affected employees included manufacturing
and administrative personnel located in North Carolina at several of the Company manufacturing facilities and at the corporate office. These actions were primarily in response to the challenging
global business environment. The Company paid $11million of the charges in 2002 and the balance in 2003. 
59 
7.IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR FIXED ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS  During the fourth quarter of 2004, in conjunction with CSMI organizational and cost reduction initiatives, certain pieces of manufacturing equipment were
identified as no longer used in operations and were taken out of service and are generally expected to be scrapped. As a result, a pretax impairment charge of $68million is included in the
$142million overall restructuring charge see Note6 to write these assets down to their estimated fair values. 
During
the second quarter of 2003, as a result of the difficult global business environment in telecommunications and a decline in demand, both domestically and internationally, and
reduced export sales from the Company Brazilian operation, management determined that certain domestic and Brazilian manufacturing assets were likely impaired. Accordingly, management obtained third
party appraisals of the majority of these specifically identified assets to determine their fair values and the resulting amount of impairment losses to be recognized. Approximately
$47million of these assets were sold at an auction in December2003 and the remainder has been classified as assets to be held and used. Based on these appraisals, the Company
recognized pretax impairment charges as follows in millions: Domestic broadband cable manufacturing assets 214 Brazilian broadband cable manufacturing assets 64 Brazilian wireless cable manufacturing assets 23 Other domestic manufacturing assets 16 Total impairment charges 317 Due
primarily to the difficult business environment in telecommunications, management performed a test of recoverability for certain long-lived assets during
the third quarter of 2002. The Company long-term undiscounted cash flow forecasts indicated that the carrying amounts of fixed assets used to manufacture CommScope wireless, fiber
optic cable and other telecom products may not be recoverable as of September30, 2002. In addition, management review of idle and obsolete fixed assets indicated additional impairment for
specifically identified manufacturing equipment. Management does not currently plan to sell, abandon or otherwise dispose of these assets, and they were, therefore, classified as assets to be held and
used. 
The
Company recognized total pretax impairment charges as follows during 2002 in millions: Wireless cable manufacturing assets 151 Fiber optic cable manufacturing assets 53 Other telecommunications cable manufacturing assets 30 Other manufacturing assets 17 Total impairment charges 251 8.ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 
During 2002, the Company wrote off $214million of Adelphia Communications Corporation Adelphia receivables as a result of Adelphia Chapter 11
bankruptcy, which was announced by 
60  Adelphia
in June2002. The Company continues to sell product to Adelphia pursuant to an agreement, which outlines the terms under which the Company will do business with Adelphia after the
bankruptcy filing date. 
In
October2003, the Company assigned its trade claims against Adelphia and its affiliates to a third party in exchange for an initial payment of $125million. This
assignment of receivables did not meet the criteria set forth in SFAS No140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities, to recognize the
proceeds as a recovery of bad debt expense, due primarily to the existence of a standard recourse provision in the assignment agreement. Therefore, the proceeds will be recognized as a noncurrent
liability until the validity and ownership of these receivables is determined, which will likely occur when the assignee receives payment under the final order issued in Adelphia bankruptcy
proceedings.

The Company entered into a 5-year, $185million senior secured credit facility on January31, 2004, in connection with its acquisition
of Connectivity Solutions. This credit facility, which amended and restated CommScope previous credit facility, is comprised of a $75million term loan and a $110million revolving
credit facility. The credit facility is secured by substantially all of the Company assets, is guaranteed by all of the Company material domestic subsidiaries and contains certain financial and
restrictive covenants. The term loan is required to be repaid in consecutive quarterly installments of $375million from March31, 2004 to September30, 2004 1175million on December31, 2004 and $325million quarterly thereafter with a final payment of all outstanding principal and interest at maturity on December31, 2008.
The Company is required to make additional repayments under the term loan in the event that a significant asset or group of assets included in the collateral base is sold. The Company repaid an
additional $25million under the term loan during the quarter ended September30, 2004 due to the sale of its idle Kings Mountain facility. In connection with this credit facility, the
Company incurred costs of approximately $46million, which were capitalized as other assets and are being amortized over the term of the facility. The interest rate on the $75million
term loan is, at CommScope option, either the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus 225% to 325%, or the Base Rate, defined as the higher of Prime Rate or Federal Funds Rate plus 050 plus 075% to 175%, in each case based on the Company fixed charge coverage ratio. The interest rate in effect at December31, 2004 was 466%. The interest rate on the $110million
revolving credit facility is, at CommScope option, LIBOR plus 200% to 300% or the Base Rate plus 050% to 150%, in each case based on the Company fixed charge coverage ratio. As of
December31, 2004, the Company had availability of approximately $48million and no outstanding borrowings under this revolving credit facility. The Company ability to borrow under
this facility depends on the amount of the borrowing base, which is determined as specified percentages of eligible receivables and inventory, reduced for certain reserves and the total amount of
letters of credit issued under the credit facility. The facility contains certain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on incurring other indebtedness, entering into transactions to acquire
or merge with any entity, making other fundamental changes, selling assets and paying dividends, among other things. The Company is also required to comply with certain financial covenants, as
defined, including a fixed charge coverage ratio, a funded senior debt to EBITDA ratio, a maximum annual capital expenditures covenant and a covenant requiring minimum ongoing excess borrowing
availability of $10million. Management believes the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants under this facility as of December31, 2004. 
62  Convertible Debentures 
In March2004, the Company issued $250million aggregate principal amount of 1% convertible senior subordinated debentures due March15,
2024. The proceeds from these debentures were used primarily
to extinguish the Company outstanding 4% convertible subordinated notes due December15, 2006, to repay $25million of borrowings under the Company revolving credit facility and for
general corporate purposes. The Company repurchased or redeemed all of its 4% convertible subordinated notes during March and April2004. The repurchase and redemption of these 4% convertible
subordinated notes resulted in a $50million pretax loss on the early extinguishment of debt. In connection with the issuance of the debentures, the Company incurred costs of approximately
$69million, which were capitalized as other assets and are being amortized over a period of five years, representing the period until the debenture holders may first require the Company to
repurchase the debentures. 
The
Company may redeem some or all of these debentures at any time on or after March20, 2009 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures, plus
accrued interest. Additionally, holders of the debentures may require the Company to repurchase all or any portion of their debentures for cash on March20, 2009, March15, 2014 and
March15, 2019 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of debentures to be repurchased, plus accrued interest. These
debentures are convertible into shares of CommScope common stock in the following circumstances: 1if the closing price of CommScope common stock exceeds 120% of the
conversion price then in effect for at least twenty trading days in the thirty consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter;
2subject to certain exceptions, during the five business days after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the debentures for each
day of such period was less than 98% of the product of the closing sale price of CommScope common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of $1,000 principal amount of the debentures;
3if the debentures have been called for redemption; or 4upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions. As
of December31, 2004, the conversion rate of these debentures was 45977 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures, representing a conversion price of $2175 per share.
The conversion rate is subject to adjustment, without duplication, upon the occurrence of any of the following events, as more fully explained in the indenture governing the debentures:
1payment or issuance of common stock as a dividend or distribution on the Company common stock; 2the issuance to all holders of common stock of rights, warrants or options to
purchase the Company common stock for a period expiring within 45days of the record date for such distribution at a price less than the average of the closing sale prices for the 10 trading
days preceding the declaration date for such distribution; 3subdivisions, splits or combinations of the Company common stock; 4distributions by the Company to all holders of the
Company common stock of shares of the Company capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, property or assets, including rights, warrants, options and other securities but excluding dividends or
distributions covered by clauses 1or 2above or any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash; provided that in the event that the Company distributes capital stock of, or
similar equity interests in, a subsidiary or other business unit of the Company, then the conversion rate will be adjusted based on the market value of the securities so distributed relative to the
market value of the Company common stock, in each case based on the average closing sales prices of those securities where such closing prices are available for the 10 trading days commencing on
and including the fifth trading day after the date on which ex-dividend trading commences for 
63  such
distribution on the New York Stock Exchange or such other principal national or regional exchange or market on which the securities are then listed or quoted or in the absence of such a
quotation, a closing sale price determined by the Company on a basis it considers appropriate; 5the payment of cash as a dividend or distribution on the Company common stock, excluding any
dividend or distribution in connection with the Company liquidation, dissolution or winding up; or 6the Company or any of its subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or
exchange offer for the Company common stock to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of the Company common stock exceeds the closing sale
price per share of the Company common stock on the trading day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer. 
To
the extent that the Company shareholder rights agreement dated June12, 1997, as amended, or any future rights plan adopted by the Company is in effect upon conversion of the
debentures into common stock, holders of the debentures will receive, in addition to the common stock, the rights under the rights plan unless the rights have separated from the common stock at the
time of conversion, in which case the conversion rate will be adjusted as if the Company distributed to all holders of its common stock, shares of its capital stock, evidences of indebtedness,
property or assets as described in clause4 above, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights. 
In
the event of 1any reclassification of the Company common stock; 2a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange involving the Company; or 3a sale or
conveyance to another person or entity of all or substantially all of the Company property and assets, in which holders of the Company common stock would be entitled to receive stock, other
securities, other property, assets or cash for their common stock, holders of the debentures will, upon conversion, be entitled to receive the same type of consideration that they would have been
entitled to receive if they had converted the debentures into the Company common stock immediately prior to any of these events. 
The
Company may, from time to time, increase the conversion rate if the Company Board of Directors has made a determination that this increase would be in the Company best interests.
In addition, the Company may increase the conversion rate if the Company Board of Directors deems it advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of common stock resulting from any stock
or rights distribution. 
IDA Notes 
In January1995, CommScope entered into a $108million unsecured loan agreement in connection with the issuance of notes by the Alabama State
Industrial Development Authority the IDA Notes. Borrowings under the IDA Notes bear interest at variable rates based upon current market conditions for short-term financing. The
interest rate in effect at December31, 2004 and 2003 was 241% and 115%, respectively. All outstanding borrowings under the IDA Notes are due on January1, 2015. 
Other Matters 
As of December2, 2002, the Company terminated its Eurodollar Credit Agreement and a related interest rate swap agreement, which were both scheduled to
expire on March1, 2006. The Company repaid the remaining principal balance of $104million and accrued interest of $05million due under the Eurodollar Credit Agreement upon
termination. The termination of the interest rate swap 
64  agreement,
which served as a fixed-rate hedge of the variable-rate borrowings under the Eurodollar Credit Agreement, resulted in an immaterial after-tax loss. 
Scheduled
maturities of long-term debt are $13million per year during 2005, 2006 and 2007 and $105million in 2008. The Company $2500million of 1%
convertible senior subordinated debentures mature in 2024 and are redeemable in whole or in part by the Company at any time on or after March20, 2009. 
The
weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings, including amortization of associated loan fees, under the above debt instruments was 270% and 485% at
December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 13.DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
As of December31, 2004 and 2003, the only derivative financial instrument outstanding was a cross currency swap of U.S. dollars for euros, which was
designated and documented at inception, and quarterly thereafter, as a net investment hedge of a portion of the Company net investment in its Belgian subsidiary. The notional amount of this
derivative financial instrument was $20million at inception of the hedging relationship. The Company amended this agreement in October2003 to reduce the notional amount to
$14million. No cash was required to effect this amendment; the change in the notional amount was offset by an adjustment in the exchange rate underlying the swap. The amended hedging
instrument was effective as of the amendment date and as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and is expected to continue to be effective for the duration of the agreement, resulting in no
anticipated hedge ineffectiveness. The agreement matures on December1, 2009. The fair value of the amended derivative instrument, reflected in other noncurrent liabilities, was approximately
$84million and $60million as of December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 
Activity
in the accumulated net loss on derivative instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003 consisted of the
following: Year Ended
December 31 2004
2003 Accumulated net loss on derivative instrument, beginning of year 3,981 802 Loss on derivative financial instrument designated as a net investment hedge, net of taxes 1,735 3,179 Accumulated net loss on derivative instruments, end of year 5,716 3,981 14.EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
Defined Contribution Plans 
Prior to the acquisition of Connectivity Solutions in January2004, the Company sponsored one defined contribution retirement savings plan. Subsequent to
the acquisition, the Company sponsors three defined contribution retirement savings plans. These plans allow employees to contribute a portion of their compensation on a pretax and/or
after-tax basis in accordance with guidelines established by the plans and the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain
limits. The Company contributed $87million in 2004, $53million in 2003 and $61million in 2002 to these retirement savings plans, of which $39million 38million and $44million, respectively, was discretionary. 
65  
The
Company also maintains a noncontributory unfunded defined contribution pension plan the Restated SERP for certain active and retired key executives. The Company is not required
to make any payments until the participant is eligible to receive retirement benefits under the Plan. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recognized pretax costs of $954, $828 and $613,
respectively, representing additional accrued benefits and interest credited under the Restated SERP. Benefit payments to retirees were $110 each year. The accrued liability, included in other
noncurrent liabilities, was approximately $67million and $58million as of December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 
The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans covering represented employees and certain domestic and foreign executives. Included in the defined benefit
pension plans are both funded and unfunded plans and contributory and noncontributory plans. The Company also sponsors postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans that provide benefits
to certain represented employees and certain full-time employees who retire from the Company at age 65 or older with a minimum of 10years of active service. Both the health care
and life insurance plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually. The health care plans contain other cost-sharing features such as deductibles, coinsurance and
caps, with Medicare as the primary provider of health care benefits for eligible retirees. The accounting for the health care plans anticipates future cost-sharing changes to the written
plan that are consistent with the Company expressed intent to maintain a consistent level of cost sharing with retirees. The Company recognizes the cost of providing and maintaining postretirement
benefits during employees' active service periods. 
On
December8, 2003, the President signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug
benefit under Medicare Medicare PartD as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare
PartD. In accordance with FSP No. FAS106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, the Company elected to prospectively recognize the effects of the Act effective July1, 2004. This reduced the postretirement
benefit cost recognized in the third and fourth quarters of 2004 by an aggregate of approximately $620. The effect of the subsidy on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
December31, 2004 and the 2004 net periodic benefit cost are reflected below.

68  The
Company considered the available yields on high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to the Company benefit obligations to determine the
discount rates at each measurement date. 
In
developing the expected rate of return on plan assets, the Company obtained input from external advisors and considered the expected long-term rate of return of each
individual asset class. Expected return on plan assets is based on the market related value of the assets. Substantially all of the pension assets and certain of the other postretirement assets are
managed by an independent investment advisor with an objective of maximizing return, subject to assuming a prudent level of risk. The majority of such assets are currently invested with a target
allocation of 70% equity securities and 30% fixed income instruments. 
The

2004, the Company increased the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets of its Brazilian subsidiary related primarily to foreign net operating loss
carryforwards by $09million. These loss carryforwards have no expiration date, but are subject to local restrictions limiting their utilization. The valuation allowance against this deferred
tax item was $89million and $80million as of December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The loss carryforward amount related to this valuation allowance was
$388million as of December31, 2004. 
The
Company Belgian subsidiary also has a deferred tax asset primarily related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $22million and $23million
as of December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These loss carryforwards have no expiration date. The loss carryforward amount related to this deferred tax asset is $70million as of
December31, 2004. The Company realized $04million of this net operating loss in 2004, and believes it is more likely than not that the remaining asset will be realized. 
The
Company removed a valuation allowance of $14million during 2004 related to a deferred tax asset arising from the impairment charge for an investment, which created a capital
loss for tax purposes. The Company was able to utilize this capital loss against capital gains created as a result of the OFS BrightWave transaction. 
71  During
2004, the Company recognized a $19million deferred tax asset related to state credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance was established related to these carryforwards.
At December31, 2004, the Company had approximately $76million net of federal tax benefit in state credits that may be utilized to reduce state income tax liabilities for future
years, through 2009. 
During
2004, the Company established a valuation allowance related to state tax net operating losses in the amount of $24million net of federal tax benefit due to the lack of
positive objective evidence that these benefits will be utilized by the applicable subsidiary. 
During
2004, the Company recognized a deferred tax asset related to a foreign tax credit carryforward of $07million and a valuation allowance was established related to this
carryforward. 
The
Company has not established a valuation allowance against the remaining deferred tax assets of $440million. The Company has determined that the assets are more likely than
not to be realized as the Company has a positive earnings history and is forecasting future taxable earnings. 
The
Company had no cumulative net undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries as of December31, 2004. 
As
a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by various taxing authorities and, from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments that may ultimately result in
the Company owing additional taxes. The Company believes that its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome resulting from
differing interpretation of applicable income tax laws and regulations. Included in other accrued liabilities are reserves of $19million and $17million at December31, 2004
and 2003, respectively, that have been provided for these matters.

In 1997, the Company adopted the Amended and Restated CommScope,Inc. 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan the CommScope Incentive Plan, which was
formally approved by the Company stockholders in 1998. The Company has amended the CommScope Incentive Plan, with stockholder approval, at various times since inception, with the latest amendment
approved during 2004. The amendment approved during 2004, among other things, increased the number of shares available under the plan and allows non-employee directors to receive awards of
restricted stock. The CommScope Incentive Plan provides for the granting of stock options, restricted stock, performance units, performance shares and phantom shares to employees of the Company and
the granting of stock, restricted stock awards and stock options to non-employee directors of the Company. As of December31, 2004, a total of 132million shares have been
authorized for issuance under the CommScope Incentive Plan. Stock options generally expire 10years from the date they are granted. Options vest over service periods that generally range from
three to four years. Upon initial election to the Company Board of Directors, a non-employee director is granted 1,000 shares of stock, which are fully vested and transferable upon
issuance, and an option to purchase 20,000 shares of stock, which vest over a three-year period. If a non-employee director remains in office, a similar option is granted every
three years.

17.STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN 
On June10, 1997, the Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan designed to protect stockholders from various abusive takeover tactics,
including attempts to acquire control of the Company at an inadequate price. Under the rights plan, each stockholder received a dividend of one right for each outstanding share of common stock, which
was distributed on July29, 1997. The rights are attached to, and presently only trade with, the common stock and currently are not exercisable. Except as specified below, upon becoming
exercisable, all rights holders will be entitled to purchase
from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock Participating Preferred Stock for each right held at a price of $60. 
The
rights become exercisable and will begin to trade separately from the common stock upon the earlier of ithe first date of public announcement that a person or group other
than pursuant to a Permitted Offer, as defined has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding common stock, or ii10 business days or such later date as the Board of
Directors of the Company may determine following a person or group commencement of, or announcement of and intention to commence, a tender or exchange offer, the consummation of which would
result in beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the common stock. The rights will entitle holders other than an Acquiring Person, as defined to purchase common stock having a market value
immediately prior to such acquisition of twice the exercise price of the right. If the Company is acquired through a merger or other business combination transaction other than a Permitted Offer,
as defined, each right will entitle the holder to purchase $120 worth of the surviving company common stock for $60. The Company may redeem the rights for $001 each at any time prior to such
acquisitions. The rights will expire on June12, 2007. 
In
connection with the rights plan, the Board of Directors approved the creation of out of the authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock of the Company participating preferred
stock, consisting of 04million shares with a par value of $001 per share. The holders of the participating preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends, if declared by the Board of
Directors, from funds 
74  legally
available. Each share of participating preferred stock is entitled to one thousand votes on all matters submitted to stockholder vote. The shares of participating preferred stock are not
redeemable by the Company nor convertible into common stock or any other security of the Company. 
18.FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The Company financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade receivables, trade payables, debt
instruments and a cross currency swap contract see Note13. For cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade receivables and trade payables, the carrying amounts of
these financial instruments as of December31, 2004 and 2003 were considered representative of their fair values due to their short terms to maturity. Quoted market prices were not available
for the Company IDA Notes see Note12, but management determined that the fair value of this variable rate debt instrument approximated its carrying value based on terms and conditions that
were available to the Company as of December31, 2004 and 2003 for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. With respect to the Company convertible debentures and
convertible notes see Note12, fair value was based on quoted market prices. The fair value of the Company cross currency swap contract was based on the net present value of the difference
between the expected future U.S. dollar cash flows and the expected future euro cash flows. The
carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company convertible debentures, convertible notes and cross currency swap as of December31, 2004 and 2003, are summarized
as follows: 2004

fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as of December31, 2004 and 2003. Although management is not aware of any
factors that would significantly affect these fair value estimates, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since those dates, and current
estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. 19.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
CommScope leases certain equipment and facilities under operating leases expiring at various dates through the year 2019. Rent expense was $88million in
2004, $63million in 2003 and $71million in 2002. Future minimum rental payments required under operating leases with initial terms of one year or more as of December31, 2004
are: $92million in 2005; $65million in 2006; $57million in 2007; $51million in 2008; $41million in 2009; and $96million thereafter. 
Prior
to the acquisition of Connectivity Solutions as of January31, 2004, the Company product warranty liability and the related activity was insignificant to the financial
position and results of operations of the Company. However, the acquisition of Connectivity Solutions has increased the 
75  Company
product warranty exposure and related liability. Product warranty reserves are reflected in other current accrued liabilities. The following table summarizes the activity for the year ended
December31, 2004 related to the warranty reserves. Reserve at beginning of year 576 Connectivity Solutions liability assumed 2,314 Provision for warranties 183 Payments 1,542 Reserve at end of year 1,531 CommScope
is either a plaintiff or a defendant in pending legal matters in the normal course of business; however, management believes none of these legal matters will have a materially
adverse effect on the Company financial position or results of operations upon final disposition. In addition, CommScope is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations
governing the
use, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous materials. Compliance with current laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a materially adverse effect on the Company
financial condition or results of operations. 
20.INDUSTRY SEGMENTS, MAJOR CUSTOMERS, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION 
Segment Information 
For the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002, the Company operations were conducted within one reportable business segment, based on the similarity of
products, production processes, distribution methods and regulatory environment. During 2004, as a result of the acquisition of Connectivity Solutions, the Company management evaluated the results
of operations in two reportable business segments: the Cable segment, which is the same as CommScope cable business prior to the acquisition of Connectivity Solutions, and the Connectivity Solutions
segment, which is the Connectivity Solutions business that was acquired as of January31, 2004. As the Company continues to integrate the Connectivity Solutions segment into its global
operations and financial reporting systems, the Company management expects to reorganize its internal reporting, which may require reporting of its results in more or different reportable segments
in future periods. 
The
Cable segment designs, manufactures and markets coaxial, fiber optic and high performance electronic cables primarily used in communications applications. The primary source of
revenues is from product sales to cable telecommunications system operators, television service providers, OEMs and distributors. 
The
Connectivity Solutions segment designs, manufactures and markets physical layer end-to-end structured cabling solutions and integrated cabinet solutions
supporting LAN applications for enterprises and telecommunications service providers. The primary source of revenues is from product sales to large multinational companies, which are made primarily
through a global network of distributors, system integrators and value-added resellers.

Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarize and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by this Annual Report on Form10-K and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December31, 2004 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
The management of CommScope is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial
reporting is defined in Rule13a-15f or 15d-15f promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
company principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those
policies and procedures that: Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company assets that could have a material
effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
CommScope
management assessed the effectiveness of CommScope internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004. In making this assessment, CommScope management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. 
Based
on this assessment, management believes that, as of December31, 2004, CommScope internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. CommScope
independent auditors have issued an audit report on management assessment of CommScope internal control over financial reporting. This report appears immediately below. 
March14,
2005 
82 
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of CommScope,Inc. We
have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that CommScope,Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained
in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinions. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
83 
In
our opinion, management assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on the
criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. 
We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule as of and for the year ended December31, 2004 of the Company and our report dated March14, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial
statement schedule. s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP
