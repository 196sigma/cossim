INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT  The McClatchy Company:  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The McClatchy Company and its subsidiaries as of December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000, and the related consolidated
statements of income, cash flows and stockholders equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2001. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index to Financial Statements and Financial
Statement Schedules at Item 8. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The McClatchy Company and its subsidiaries at December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 30, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.  Deloitte Touche LLP Sacramento, California January 25, 2002

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  NOTE 1.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The McClatchy Company the Company and its subsidiaries are engaged primarily in the publication of newspapers
located in Minnesota, California, the Northwest Washington and Alaska and the Carolinas.  The consolidated financial
statements include the Company and its subsidiaries. Significant inter-company items and transactions are eliminated. In preparing the financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Revenue recognitionAdvertising revenues are recorded when advertisements are placed in the newspaper and circulation revenues
are recorded as newspapers are delivered over the subscription term. Unearned revenues represent prepaid circulation subscriptions.  Cash equivalents are highly liquid debt investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.  Concentrations of credit risksFinancial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risks are principally cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivables. Cash and cash equivalents are
placed with major financial institutions. Accounts receivable are with customers located primarily in the immediate area of each city of publication. The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of significant customers and this assessment,
combined with the large number and geographic diversity of its customers, limits the Companys concentration of risk with respect to trade accounts receivable.  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost based principally on the first-in, first-out method or current market value. 
Related party transactionsThe Company owns a 135% interest in Ponderay Newsprint Company Ponderay which owns and operates a newsprint mill in the State
of Washington. The investment is accounted for using the equity method, under which the Companys share of earnings of Ponderay is reflected in income as earned. The Company guarantees certain bank debt used to construct the mill see note 7
and is required to purchase 28,400 metric tons of annual production on a take-if-tendered basis at prevailing market prices until the debt is repaid. The Company satisfies this obligation by direct purchase 2001: $10,802,000, 2000 16,497,000 and 1999: $14,055,000 or reallocation to other buyers.  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
Major improvements, as well as interest incurred during construction, are capitalized. 
30  Depreciation is computed generally on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of:  - 10 to 60 years for buildings - 9 to 25 years for presses
- 3 to 15 years for other equipment  Intangibles consist of the unamortized excess of the cost of acquiring newspaper operations over the fair values of the newspapers tangible assets at the date of purchase. Identifiable intangible assets, consisting primarily of
lists of advertisers and subscribers, covenants not to compete and commercial printing contracts, are amortized over three to forty years. The excess of purchase prices over identifiable assets is amortized over forty years. Management periodically
evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets by reviewing the current and projected cash flows of each of its newspaper operations. See note 10.  Stock-based compensationThe Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. 
Derivative instrumentsThe Company records its derivative instruments, primarily interest rate protection agreements, at fair
value in its financial statements. See notes 2 and 9.  Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between
amounts of assets and liabilities reported for financial and income tax reporting purposes. See note 3.  Comprehensive income
lossThe Company records changes in its net assets presented from non-owner sources in its Statement of Stockholders Equity. Such changes relate primarily to valuing its interest rate protection agreements and pension liabilities,
net of tax effects.  Segment reportingThe Companys primary business is the publication of newspapers. The
Company aggregates its newspapers into a single segment because each has similar economic characteristics, products, customers and distribution methods.  Earnings per share EPSBasic EPS excludes dilution and reflects income divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted average
number of outstanding shares of common stock and dilutive common stock equivalents stock optionsequivalents calculated using the treasury stock method, no adjustment to net income required in the period. See note 8.  NOTE 2.LONG-TERM BANK DEBT AND OTHER LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS  The Companys Credit Agreement includes term loans consisting of Tranche A of $404,000,000 bearing interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus 625 basis points,
payable in increasing quarterly installments through March 21, 2005, and Tranche B of $181,000,000 bearing interest at LIBOR plus 150 basis points and payable in semi-annual 
31  installments through September 19, 2007. A revolving credit line of up to $200,000,000 bears interest at LIBOR plus 625
basis points and is payable by March 19, 2005. Interest rates applicable to debt drawn down at December 30, 2001, ranged from 26% to 39%.  The terms of the Credit Agreement include certain operating and financial restrictions, such as limits on the Companys ability to incur additional debt, create liens, sell assets, engage in mergers, make
investments and pay dividends. The debt is unsecured and is pre-payable without penalty.  At December 30, 2001 the Company had
outstanding letters of credit totaling $7,841,000 securing estimated obligations stemming from workers compensation claims and other contingent claims.  The Company does not have, nor does it intend to enter into, derivative contracts for trading purposes. The Company has not attempted to hedge fluctuations in the normal purchases of goods and services used to conduct
its business operations. Currently there is no intent to hedge or enter into contracts with embedded derivatives for the purchase of newsprint, ink, and other inventories, leases of equipment and facilities, or its business insurance contracts.
The Company has three interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges specifically designed to hedge the
variability in the expected cash flows that are attributable to interest rate fluctuations on $200,000,000 of its variable rate bank debt through June 2002, and $100,000,000 through June 2003. The effect of these agreements is to fix the LIBOR
interest rate exposure at approximately 59% on that portion of the Companys term loans.  Two additional interest rate
swap agreements were entered into in the fourth quarter of 2001 to replace the $200,000,000 swap agreement which expires in 2002. The first is an agreement for $100,000,000 at a fixed interest rate of 34%, beginning in June 2002 and expiring in
June 2003. The second is an agreement for $100,000,000 at a fixed interest rate of 38% beginning in June 2002 and expiring in June 2004.  The five swap instruments provide for payments of interest at the fixed rates and receipt of interest at variable rates which are reset to three-month LIBOR rates quarterly. Net payments or receipts under such
agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense. The swaps were entered into to match the significant terms of the underlying debt to provide highly effective hedges.  The effect of these hedges is to have fixed rate swap agreements through June 2003 hedging $300,000,000 of debt and to have fixed rate swap agreements from June 2003 through June 2004
hedging $100,000,000 of debt.  No gain or loss has been recorded in net income as a result of ineffectiveness of these
hedges. A loss, net of taxes, of $4,385,000 is recorded in comprehensive income related to these hedgessee the Companys Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity.

NOTE 5.EMPLOYEE BENEFITS  The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans retirement plans which cover a majority of its employees. Benefits are based on years of service
and compensation. Contributions to the plans are made by the Company in amounts deemed necessary to provide benefits. Plan assets consist primarily of investments in marketable securities including common stocks, bonds and U.S. government
obligations, and other interest bearing accounts. The Company contributed $1,999,000 in 2001, $1,855,000 in 2002 and $1,600,000 in 1999 to multi-employer retirement plans. 
35  The Company also has a number of supplemental retirement plans to provide key employees with
additional retirement benefits. The terms of the plans are generally the same as those of the retirement plans, except that the supplemental retirement plans are limited to key employees and benefits under them are reduced by benefits received under
the retirement plans. These plans are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis and the accrued pension obligation is included in other long-term obligations.  The elements of pension costs are as follows in thousands:

For pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets,
the projected benefit obligation, the accumulated benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets were $72,088,000, $67,606,000 and $45,286,000 respectively, as of December 30, 2001 and $16,060,000, $15,806,000 and $0, respectively, as of
December 31, 2000.  For the McClatchy Newspapers, Inc. post-retirement plan benefit obligation of $ 45 million, income of
$282,000, the medical care cost trend rates are estimated to decline from 725% in 2001 to 58% by the year 2002. A 10% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have changed the benefit obligation and the annual service cost only
nominally. For the Star Tribune post-retirement plan, the medical cost trend rates are expected to decline from 70% in 2001 to 55% by the year 2004. For the Star Tribunes plan benefit obligation of $81 million and expense of
$931,000, a 10% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have increased the benefit obligation and expense by $791,000 and $125,000 respectively, and decreased each by $697,000 and $109,000, respectively.  The Company has deferred compensation plans 401k plans and other savings plans which enable qualified employees to voluntarily defer compensation.
The Companys mandatory matching contributions to the 401k plans were $6,494,000 in 2001, $6,198,000 in 2000, and $6,232,000 in 1999.  NOTE

39  There are libel and other legal actions that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and
are pending against the Company. From time to time, the Company is involved as a party in various governmental proceedings, including environmental matters. Management believes, after reviewing such actions with counsel, that the outcome of pending
actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position.   NOTE8. 
COMMON STOCK AND STOCK PLANS 
The Companys Class A and Class B common stock participate equally in
dividends. Holders of Class B common stock are entitled to one vote per share and to elect as a class 75% of the Board of Directors, rounded down to the nearest whole number. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one-tenth of a vote per
share and to elect as a class 25% of the Board of Directors, rounded up to the nearest whole number. Class B common stock is convertible at the option of the holder into Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis.  At December 30, 2001, the Company has six stock-based compensation plans, which are described below. The Company applies APB Opinion 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for its plans. No significant amounts of compensation costs have been recognized for its fixed stock option plans and its stock purchase plan.  The Companys Amended Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan reserved 1,875,000 shares of Class A common stock for issuance to employees. Eligible employees may purchase
shares at 85% of fair market value as defined through payroll deductions. The Purchase Plan can be automatically terminated by the Company at any time. As of December 30, 2001, a total of 1,148,653 shares of Class A common stock have
been issued under the Purchase Plan.  The Company has three stock option plans which reserve 4,812,500 Class A common shares for
issuance to key employees the 1987, 1994 and 1997 plans Employee Plans. Terms of each of the Employee Plans are substantially the same. Options are granted at the market price of the Class A common stock on the date of grant.
The options vest in installments over four years, and once vested are exercisable up to 10 years from the date of grant. Although the plans permit the Company, at its sole discretion, to settle unexercised options by granting stock appreciation
rights, the Company does not intend to avail itself of this alternative except in limited circumstances.  The Companys two
amended and restated stock option plans for outside directors the 1990 Stock Option Plan and the 2001 Director Plan, together the Directors Plans provide for the issuance of up to 687,500 shares of Class A stock. Under these
plans each non-employee director is granted an option to purchase at fair market value at the conclusion of each regular annual meeting of stockholders 2,500 shares of Class A stock. 
40  Terms of the Directors Plans are similar to the terms of the Employee Plans. Outstanding
options are summarized as follows:

Had compensation costs for the Companys six stock-based compensation plans
been determined based upon the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with the method of SFAS Statement No. 123, the Companys net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts

The impact of outstanding non-vested stock options granted prior to 1995 has been
excluded from the pro forma calculation; accordingly, the 2001, 2000 and 1999 pro forma adjustments are not indicative of future period pro forma adjustments, when the calculation will apply to all applicable stock options.  Compensation costs are calculated for the fair value of the employees purchase rights, which was estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the
following assumptions for 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively: dividend yield of 10% to 14% for all years; an expected life of one to seven years for all years; expected volatility of 2691, 2732 and 2862; and risk-free interest rates of 21% to
55% in 2001, 53% to 68% in 2000, and 54% to 63% in 1999. The weighted-average fair value of those purchase rights granted in 2001, 2000, and 1999 was $1327, $1218 and $1343.

The Company does not have, nor does it intend to enter into derivative contracts
for trading purposes. The Company does not attempt to hedge fluctuations in the normal purchases of goods and services used to conduct its business operations. Hence, there is no intent to hedge or enter into contracts with embedded derivatives for
the purchase of newsprint, ink and other inventories, leases of equipment and facilities, or its business insurance contracts.  The Companys five interest rate swap agreements see note 2 are designated as cash flow hedges and are specifically designed to hedge the variability in the expected cash flows that is attributable to interest rate fluctuations on
$300,000,000 of its variable rate bank debt in 2001 through 2003, and $100,000,000 from 2003 through 2004. The swaps were entered into to match the significant terms of the debt to provide highly effective hedges.  The Company does not expect any significant net gain or loss to be recognized in earnings as a result of ineffectiveness of its cash flow hedges, nor
any significant impact to its consolidated statement of financial position to result from recording the fair value of its cash flow hedges in its consolidated financial statements.  NOTE
10.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AFFECTING FUTURE YEARS  In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board approved for issuance SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
SFAS No. 141 eliminates pooling of interest accounting for business combinations and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination. SFAS No. 141 is applicable to business
combinations beginning July 1, 2001. 
43  SFAS No. 142 addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired in
connection with a business combination whether acquired individually or with a group of other assets. SFAS No. 142 also addresses the recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. The Company
adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002 as required. The Company expects that the adoption of SFAS No. 142 will reduce the amortization expense recognized by the Company in fiscal year 2002 by approximately $346 million, and will reduce the
effective income tax rate applied to the Companys income before taxes to an estimated rate of 397% in 2002.   NOTE 11.QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UNAUDITED 
The Companys business is somewhat seasonal, with peak revenues and profits
generally occurring in the second and fourth quarters of each year as a result of increased advertising activity during the spring holiday and Christmas periods. The first quarter is historically the weakest quarter for revenues and profits. The
