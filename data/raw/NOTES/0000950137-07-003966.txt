ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The accompanying consolidated financial statements of TLC Vision Corporation have been
prepared by management in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. The significant accounting policies have been set out in Note 2 to the financial
statements. These statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting. Accordingly, a
precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events. Therefore,
estimates and approximations have been made using careful judgment. Recognizing that the Company is
responsible for both the integrity and objectivity of the financial statements, management is
satisfied that these financial statements have been prepared within reasonable limits of
materiality under United States generally accepted accounting principles. During the year ended December31, 2006, the Board of Directors had an Audit Committee
consisting of four non-management directors. The committee met with management and the auditors to
review any significant accounting, internal control and auditing matters and to review and finalize
the annual financial statements of the Company along with the report of independent registered
public accounting firm prior to the submission of the financial statements to the Board of
Directors for final approval. The financial information throughout the text of this Annual Report is consistent with the
information presented in the financial statements. The Companys accounting procedures and related systems of internal control are designed to
provide reasonable assurance that its assets are safeguarded and its financial records are
reliable. 42 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders of TLC Vision Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TLC Vision Corporation as of
December31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and
stockholders equity for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2006. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at a. These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of TLC Vision Corporation at December31, 2006 and
2005, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects,
the information set forth therein. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, on January1, 2006, the Company
changed its method of accounting for depreciation and stock-based compensation. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the effectiveness of TLC Vision Corporations internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated March5, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion.

tabular amounts in thousands, except per share amounts 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS TLC Vision Corporation and its subsidiaries TLCVision or the Company is a diversified
healthcare services company focused on working with eye doctors to help them provide high quality
patient care primarily in the eye care segment. The majority of the Companys revenues come from
refractive surgery, which involves using an excimer laser to treat common refractive vision
disorders such as myopia nearsightedness, hyperopia farsightednessand astigmatism. The
Companys business models include arrangements ranging from owning and operating fixed site centers
to providing access to lasers through fixed site and mobile service relationships. In addition to
refractive surgery, the Company is diversified into other eye care businesses. Through its MSS
subsidiary, the Company furnishes hospitals and independent surgeons with mobile or fixed site
access to cataract surgery equipment and services. Through its OR Partners and Michigan
subsidiaries, TLCVision develops, manages and has equity participation in single-specialty eye care
ambulatory surgery centers and multi-specialty ambulatory surgery centers. The Company also owns a
51% majority interest in Vision Source, which provides franchise opportunities to independent
optometrists. In 2002, the Company formed a joint venture with OccuLogix, Inc. formerly Vascular
Sciences Corporation to create OccuLogix, L.P., a partnership focused on specific eye diseases
including dry age-related macular degeneration AMD, glaucoma and dry-eye. On December8, 2004, the Company exchanged its 50% interest in OccuLogix L.P. for a 50%
interest in OccuLogix, Inc. In connection therewith, the Company converted its SeriesB preferred
stock and convertible grid debentures into common shares of OccuLogix, Inc. After the exchange and
conversion, the Company owned 658% of the outstanding common shares of OccuLogix, Inc.
OccuLogix. As a result of the exchange, OccuLogix L.P. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
OccuLogix. The Company accounted for the exchange at historical cost. Immediately after the
exchange, OccuLogix completed an initial public offering IPO whereby OccuLogix sold 56million
shares of its common stock at $12 per share. Because the IPO price exceeded the per share carrying
amount of the Companys investment in OccuLogix, the Companys equity ownership in OccuLogix after
the IPO exceeded its equity ownership before the IPO by $301million. In accordance with Staff
Accounting Bulletin No84, the Company accounted for the excess as an equity transaction. In
connection with the IPO, TLCVision sold 23million shares of its OccuLogix common stock at $12 per
share and recorded a gain of $258million. The Company has included the results of
operations of OccuLogix in its consolidated statement of operations for the periods from December
8, 2004 through March31, 2006. In April2006, TLCVision sold 08million shares of its OccuLogix common stock and recorded a
gain of $14million. After the sale of stock, the Company owned less than 50% of OccuLogix.
Effective April1, 2006, the Company deconsolidated OccuLogix and began accounting for its
investment in OccuLogix under the equity method. At December31, 2006, the Company owns 207
million shares or 41% of OccuLogixs common stock. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its majority-owned
subsidiaries and all variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Variable Interest Entities The Company consolidates physician practices that are managed but not owned by the Company
because the Company is the primary beneficiary. The consolidation of the physician practices
results in an increase in revenues and cost of revenues for refractive centers, however it has no
material impact on total assets, gross profit or operating income and no impact on net income. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid short-term investments with original
maturities of 90days or less. 48 Table of Contents Short-Term Investments As of December31, 2006 and 2005, short-term investments include auction rate securities,
which are available to support the Companys current operations. These investments are classified
as available-for-sale securities and are recorded at fair value. There are no unrealized gains or
losses associated with these auction rate securities due to the short time period between interest
rate reset dates. All of the auction rate securities have contractual maturities of more than five
years. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a first-in
first-out basis. Investments The Company has certain investments in equity securities. Investments are accounted for using
the equity method if the Company has significant influence, but not control, over an investee. All
other equity investments, in which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant
influence, are accounted for under the cost method. Under the cost method of accounting,
investments that do not have a quoted market price non-marketable equity securities are carried
at cost and are adjusted only for other than temporary declines in fair value and additional
investment activity. For investments in public companies marketable equity securities, the
Company classifies its investments as available-for-sale and, accordingly, records these
investments at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other
comprehensive income, unless a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, in
which case the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in earnings. Fixed Assets Fixed assets are recorded at cost or the present value of future minimum lease payments for
assets under capital lease. The costs of additions, improvements and major replacements are
capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is provided on
the straight-line basis and at rates intended to represent the assets productive lives as follows   
Buildings
- 40years   Computer equipment and software
- three to four years   Furniture, fixtures and equipment
- seven years   Laser and medical equipment
- five to seven years   Leasehold improvements
- shorter of useful life or initial term of the lease   Vehicles and other
- five years Prior to January1, 2006, the Company recorded depreciation using the 25% declining balance
method for certain fixed asset categories see Note 3. Goodwill The Company tests for impairment at least annually and more frequently if changes in
circumstances or events indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment has occurred. The
Companys annual impairment test date is November30. Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets consist primarily of practice management agreements PMAs, deferred
contract rights, and tradenames. PMAs represent the cost of obtaining the exclusive right to manage
eye care centers and secondary care centers in affiliation with the related physician group during
the term of the respective agreements. Deferred contract rights represent the value of contracts
with affiliated doctors to provide basic access and service. Tradenames represent the value
associated with the name of an entity that was acquired by the Company. All identifiable
intangibles with a finite life are amortized using the straight-line method over the respective
estimated useful lives. Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable. 49 Table of Contents Medical Malpractice Accruals To mitigate a portion of the risk associated with medical malpractice lawsuits, the Company
maintains insurance for individual malpractice claims with a deductible of $250,000 per claim and a
total annual aggregate deductible of $15million. The Company and its insurance carrier review
malpractice lawsuits for purposes of establishing ultimate loss estimates. The Company records
reserves to cover the estimated costs of the deductible for both reported and unreported medical
malpractice claims incurred. The estimates are based on the average monthly claims expense and the
estimated average time lag between the performance of a procedure and notification of a claim. If
the number of claims or the cost of settled claims is higher than the Companys historical
experience or if the actual time lag varies from the estimated time lag, the Company may need to
record significant additional expense. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes refractive revenues when the procedure is performed. Revenue from
centers represents the amount charged to patients for a laser vision correction procedure, net of
discounts, contractual adjustments in certain regions and amounts collected as an agent of
co-managing doctors. Revenue from access services represents the amount charged to the
customer/surgeon for access to equipment and technical support based on use. Contractual adjustments arise due to the terms of reimbursement and managed care contracts in
certain regions. Such adjustments represent the difference between the charges at established rates
and estimated recoverable amounts and are recognized as a reduction of revenue in the period
services are rendered. Any differences between estimated contractual adjustments and actual final
settlements under reimbursement contracts are recognized as contractual adjustments in the period
final settlements are determined. The Companys other healthcare services revenues principally include cataract equipment access
and service fees on a per procedure basis, management fees from cataract and secondary care
practices and optometric franchising services. Revenues from other healthcare services are
recognized as the service is rendered or when the procedure is performed. Cost of Revenues Included in cost of revenues are the laser fees payable to laser manufacturers for royalties,
use and maintenance of the lasers, variable expenses for consumables, financing costs, facility
fees as well as center costs associated with personnel and facilities depreciation. Marketing Marketing costs are expensed as incurred. Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the income tax basis of assets
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the applicable
enacted statutory tax rates. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on
the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. Foreign Currency Exchange The functional currency of the Companys Canadian operations is the U.S. dollar. The assets
and liabilities of the Companys Canadian operations are maintained in Canadian dollars and
remeasured into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the consolidated balance sheet date
for monetary items and at exchange rates prevailing at the transaction dates for nonmonetary items.
Revenues and expenses are remeasured into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during
the year with the exception of depreciation and amortization, which are translated at historical
exchange rates. Exchange gains and losses are included in net income. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is determined by dividing net income available to common stockholders
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings
per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if options to issue common stock were
exercised. In periods in which the inclusion of such instruments is anti-dilutive, the effect of
such securities is not given consideration. 50 Table of Contents Contingent Consideration When the Company enters into agreements that provide for contingent consideration based on
certain predefined targets being met, an analysis is made to determine whether the contingent
consideration represents an additional purchase price obligation or is deemed to be compensation
expense. The accounting treatment if the consideration is determined to be an additional purchase
price payment is to increase the value assigned to the net assets acquired. Where the contingent
consideration is deemed to be compensation, the expense is reflected as an operating expense in the
periods that the service is rendered. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. These estimates are reviewed
periodically, and as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in income in the period in
which they become known. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications of prior year presentations have been made to conform to the 2006 presentation. Prospective Accounting Pronouncements In June2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Interpretation 48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48, an interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No109,
Accounting for Income Taxes, to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in
tax positions. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum
recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial
statements. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006. The Company
will adopt FIN 48 as of January1, 2007, and the cumulative effect of the new standard will be
recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. The impact of the adoption of FIN 48 is not
expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position. In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.
157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157, which addresses how fair value should be measured when
required for recognition or disclosure purposes under GAAP. It also establishes a fair value
hierarchy and will require expanded disclosures on fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective
for the Company beginning 2008. The Company has not completed assessing the impact that SFAS 157
will have on its consolidated financial statements. 3. ACCOUNTING CHANGES Depreciation Method On January1, 2006, the Company changed its depreciation policy for the following asset
classifications: furniture, fixtures and equipment; laser and
medical equipment; and
vehicles and other. The Company changed to the straight-line depreciation method from the 25%
declining balance method for these assets. The change was reflected prospectively in the Companys
financial statements both for new assets acquired after January1, 2006 and for assets previously
held from that date forward. Managements decision to change was based on its judgment that
straight-line depreciation provides a better method of reflecting the pattern of consumption of the
assets being depreciated over their estimated useful lives given their characteristics and usage
patterns. The Company has determined that the design and durability of these assets diminishes
ratably over time, and it is therefore preferable to recognize the related cost uniformly over
their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. During the year ended December31, 2006, the
change decreased depreciation expense by approximately $08 million $07million after tax or $001 per
basic and diluted share. Stock-based Compensation On December16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment,
Statement 123R effective January1, 2006, which is a revision of FASB Statement No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Statement 123. Generally, the approach in Statement
123R is similar to the approach described in Statement 123. However, Statement 123R requires
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized
in the statements of operations based on their fair values. Under Statement 123R, pro forma
disclosure is no longer permitted. Prior to January1, 2006, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation utilizing the
intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and its related interpretations. Accordingly, no
compensation expense was recognized for fixed option plans because the exercise prices of employee 51 Table of Contents stock options equaled or exceeded the market prices of the underlying stock on the dates of
grant. However, stock-based compensation has been included in pro forma disclosures in the
financial statement footnotes in prior periods. Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of
Statement 123R using the modified prospective method of application, which requires the Company
to recognize compensation expense on a prospective basis. Therefore, prior period financial
statements have not been restated to recognize compensation expense under the provisions of
Statement 123R. Under this method, in addition to reflecting compensation expense for new
stock-based awards, expense is also recognized to reflect the remaining service period of awards
that had been included in pro forma disclosures in prior periods. Statement 123R also requires
that excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises be reflected as financing cash inflows
instead of operating cash inflows. Total stock-based compensation for the year ended December31, 2006 was $14million. In
connection with its adoption of Statement 123R, the Company recorded $10million $09million
after tax or $001 per basic and diluted share for TLCVision stock options and its Employee Share
Purchase Plan. Total stock-based compensation also includes $02million $01million after
minority interests and tax or less than $001 per basic and diluted share of stock-based
compensation expense recorded by OccuLogix in connection with its adoption of Statement 123R
prior to the Company deconsolidating OccuLogix. The Company also recorded stock-based compensation of $02 million
and $06 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, for the value of stock issued in connection with the Companys 401k
matching program. As of December31, 2006, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to TLCVision
non-vested employee awards was approximately $43million. The unrecognized compensation expense
will be recognized over the remaining vesting period, which expires December2010 for certain
options. The weighted-average expense period for non-vested employee awards is 35years. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as if
Statement 123R had been applied to all outstanding awards for the years ended December31, 2005

For awards granted prior to the adoption of Statement 123R, the Company uses the attribution
method under FASB Interpretation No28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other
Variable Stock Option Award Plans, to amortize stock-based compensation cost. For awards granted
subsequent to the adoption of Statement 123R, the Company uses the straight-line method to
amortize stock-based compensation cost. In December2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved the accelerated vesting of all
unvested and out-of-the-money stock options with an exercise price per share of $875 or higher.
In accordance with SFAS No123, the Company recognized the remaining balance of unrecognized
compensation cost for the affected options at the time of modification in the pro forma
disclosures. 4. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS On April11, 2006, the Company sold 08million shares of OccuLogix common stock and recorded
a gain of $14million. After the sale of stock, the Company owned approximately 49% of OccuLogix.
Due to the insignificance of the results of operations of OccuLogix from April1, 2006 through
April11, 2006, the Company deconsolidated OccuLogix effective April1, 2006 and has accounted for
its investment in OccuLogix under the equity method since that date. The Company owns approximately
41% of OccuLogix as of December31, 2006 due to additional issuances of shares by OccuLogix since
April2006. On December1, 2005, the Company acquired a 49% interest in Liberty Eye Surgical Center, LLC
Liberty for $62million in cash. Liberty is an ambulatory surgery center located in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that primarily provides cataract surgery services. On November8, 2005, the Company acquired TruVision for $174million in cash and 3,913 shares
of company common stock valued at approximately $24,000, coupled with a three-year earn out. In
addition, the Company assumed certain liabilities and incurred 52 Table of Contents transaction costs of $04million. TruVision is a managed care contractor to health plan
members and large corporations across 44 states. TruVisions services enable insurance health plans
and large corporations to offer LASIK vision surgery to their members at a reduced price. The

The Company engaged an independent appraiser to assist in the valuation of acquired intangible
assets. Intangible assets consist of a $33million Customer Relationship asset which will be
amortized over 12years and a $30,000 Non-Compete Contract asset which will be amortized over
three years. On July11, 2005, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of Kremer Laser Eye
Kremer. Kremer operates three refractive centers and one ambulatory surgery center all of which
are located in the northeastern part of the United States. For over 20years, Kremer has been an
integrated eye care company providing refractive, cataract and glaucoma surgery services. The
acquisition of Kremer expands the Companys presence in both the refractive and ASC businesses in
one of the largest populated markets in the United States. The purchase price for the acquired assets was $297million. In addition, the Company assumed
certain liabilities and incurred transaction costs of $11million. Simultaneously with this
transaction, the Company sold an 18% interest in Kremer to a group of doctors associated with
Kremer for $53million. As a result, the Company maintains an 82% ownership interest in Kremer.
The results of operations of Kremer have been included in the Companys consolidated statements of
operations since July11, 2005. Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price is allocated to Kremers net
tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair value as of the date of the
acquisition. The following reflects the assets and liabilities acquired by the Company in the

over 20years and $02million of a Non-Compete Contract asset which will be amortized over eight
years. The Company believes that substantially all of the goodwill will be deductible for tax
purposes. 53 Table of Contents On July1, 2005, the Company acquired a 100% interest in Millennium Laser Eye Millennium
for $61million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. Millennium provides

results to include the results of operations of the acquired entities. The pro forma results do not
include any cost savings that may result from the combination of TLCVision and the operations of
the acquired entities. The pro forma results may not necessarily reflect the consolidated
operations that would have existed had the acquisitions been completed at the beginning of such
periods nor are they necessarily indicative of future results.

On March1, 2005, the Company sold its interest in Aspen Healthcare, Inc. to National Surgical
Centers, Inc. and recorded a gain of $03million, which is included in other operating expenses. On January1, 2004, the Company settled a lawsuit brought by Thomas S. Tooma, M.D. and TST
Acquisitions, LLC TST in October2002. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company sold
approximately 24% of Laser Eye Care of California LECC and 30% of its California access
business to TST for $23million. The Company continues to hold a 30% ownership in LECC, and a 70%
ownership in the California access business. The Company recorded a $11million gain on the sale
of these business interests which is included in other operating expenses. Effective January1,
2004, the Company deconsolidated LECC and began reporting its interest in LECC under the equity
method of accounting because it no longer owns a controlling interest in the entity. The Companys strategy includes periodic acquisitions of or investments in entities that
operate in the refractive, cataract or eye care markets. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company
paid a total of approximately $8million, $13million and $10million, respectively, to acquire or
invest in several other entities, none of which individually was greater than $5million. 5. RESTRICTED CASH The Company had $10million of restricted cash as of December31, 2006 and 2005 to guarantee
outstanding bank letters of credit for leases and litigation. 54 Table of Contents 6. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Accounts receivable, net of allowances, consist of the following

and its 207million shares of OccuLogix represented a fair market value of $325million based on
the year-end closing price of OccuLogixs common stock. Since April1, 2006, the Company has
accounted for the results of OccuLogix under the equity method. As of and during the nine months

For the nine months ended December31, 2006, the net loss for OccuLogix includes a $659
million charge for impairment of goodwill. Because the Company accounted for its original
investment in OccuLogix at historical cost, the Company must eliminate certain items, including the
$659million impairment of goodwill, when it recognizes equity earnings lossesfrom OccuLogix.
For the nine months ended December31, 2006, the Company recognized $58million of equity losses
from OccuLogix. OccuLogixs history of losses and financial condition raise substantial doubt about
its ability to continue as a going concern. Long-term receivables include notes from and advances to service providers and other
companies. As of December31, 2003, the Company maintained a $12million reserve against a
long-term receivable from a secondary care service provider of which the Company owns approximately
25% of the outstanding common shares. The Company determined that the ability of this secondary
care service provider to repay this note was in doubt due to the deteriorating financial condition
of the investee. During 2004, the secondary care provider was profitable, improved its financial
strength and consistently made all payments to the Company when due. As a result, the Company
reevaluated the collectibility of this note receivable during 2004 and recorded an adjustment to
reverse the reserve of $12million, which is included in other operating expenses, net. The
Company has loaned additional funds to the secondary care service provider to fund expansion of the
business. As of December31, 2006, the outstanding loan balances are $17million. In addition, the
Company has loaned $16million to an entity in which the Company has a minor ownership percentage
and accounts for under the cost method. Prior to 2004, the Company entered into a joint venture with the predecessor of OccuLogix for
the purpose of pursuing commercial applications of technologies owned or licensed by OccuLogix
applicable to the evaluation, diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of dry age related macular
degeneration. Prior to the reorganization and IPO of OccuLogix see Note 1, the Company accounted
for its investment as a research and development arrangement since the technology is in the
development stage and has not received FDA approval. Prior to 2003, the Company agreed to advance
up to an additional $60million to OccuLogix pursuant to a secured convertible grid debenture. The
first $35million advanced pursuant to such debenture was convertible into common shares of
OccuLogix. OccuLogix also granted an option to the Company to acquire an amount of common shares
equal to the undrawn portion of the debenture at any point in time. Prior to 2004, the Company
expensed $16million to research and development related to payments made to OccuLogix. Of this
amount, $13million reduced the value of the $60million obligation to OccuLogix, and $03
million represented an additional equity investment in Common Stock and therefore did not reduce
the amount of the remaining obligation. In 2004, the Company advanced $22million to OccuLogix,
satisfying the $35million obligation that was converted into shares of OccuLogix. Of this amount,
the Company advanced $12million to OccuLogix in the first three quarters of 2004 and expensed it
as research and development. The remaining advance to OccuLogix of $10million in the fourth
quarter of 2004 was recorded as an investment because it was not used by OccuLogix for operating
purposes, but rather was available at December31, 2004 for future needs. Due to the IPO of
OccuLogix, the Company was not required to fund any additional amounts. 56 Table of Contents 9. GOODWILL The Companys goodwill amount by reporting segment is as follows

The Company tests goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter after the annual forecasting
process. After estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using the present value of expected
future cash flows, the Company determined that no goodwill impairment charges should be recorded
during the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004. During the year ended December31, 2006, the
Company recognized an impairment loss of $41million associated with an ambulatory surgery center
since the carrying amount of the reporting unit was greater than the fair value of the reporting
unit as determined using the expected present value of future cash flows. 10. OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Companys other intangible assets consist of practice management agreements PMAs,
deferred contract rights, tradenames and other intangibles. The Company has no indefinite-lived
intangible assets. Amortization expense was $35million, $40million and $41million for the
years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The remaining weighted average amortization period for PMAs is 45years, for deferred
contract rights is 54years, for tradenames is 183years and for other intangibles is 91years
as of December31, 2006. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist of the following at December31

In November2003, the Company obtained a $15million line of credit for five years from GE
Healthcare Financial Services the Agreement for a $01million commitment fee and $02million
in related legal and out-of-pocket expenses. This loan is secured by certain accounts receivable
and cash accounts in wholly-owned subsidiaries and a general lien on most other U.S. assets. As of
December31, 2006, the Company did not have any borrowings drawn under the line of credit and had
an available unused line of $15million. The Agreement includes a subjective acceleration clause and a requirement to maintain a
springing lock-box, whereby remittances from the Companys customers are forwarded to the
Companys bank account and do not reduce the outstanding debt until and unless the lender exercises
the subjective acceleration clause. Under the Agreement, the Company must maintain 1consolidated cash of $125million or more,
2a maximum total debt/EBITDA Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization
ratio no more than 15, 3a fixed charge coverage ratio including option proceeds and excluding
most non-cash charges of at least 11 and 4obtain GEs approval for certain ineligible
acquisitions and unfunded capital additions greater than $2million per year. During the year ended May31, 2002, the Company completed a sale-leaseback transaction. Total
consideration received for the sale of the building and related land was Cdn$101million, which was
comprised of Cdn$86million in cash and a Cdn$15million 80% note receivable Note. The Note has a
seven-year term with the first of four annual payments of Cdn$01million starting on the third
anniversary of the sale and a final payment of Cdn$11million due on the seventh anniversary of the
sale. The Company accounted for this transaction in accordance with SFAS No98, Accounting for
Leases SFAS 98. SFAS 98 prohibits sale recognition on a sale-leaseback transaction when the
sublease is considered to be minor and the only recourse to any future amounts owing from the other
party is the leased asset. A sublease is considered to be minor when the present value of the
sublease rent is less than 10% of the total fair market value. The Company accounted for the
transaction as a financing transaction which requires sale proceeds to be recorded as a liability
and for the Note to not be recognized. In addition, since the sale recognition is not accounted
for, the carrying value of the asset is not adjusted for and the asset continues to be depreciated
over the original depreciation period of 40years. Lease payments, exclusive of an interest
portion, decrease the liability while payments received on the Note increase the liability. Future
minimum lease payments over the next five years are as follows

The per share amounts have been computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares
outstanding. The calculation of diluted earnings per share for 2006, 2005 and 2004 excludes the impact of
25million, 10million and 09million stock options, respectively, because to include them would
have been anti-dilutive. Diluted earnings per share have been computed as follows

16. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND OPTIONS Options Outstanding As of December31, 2006, the Company has issued stock options to employees, directors and
certain other individuals. Options granted have terms ranging from five to ten years. Vesting
provisions on options granted to date include options that vest immediately, options that vest in
equal amounts annually over the first two years or four years of the option term and options that
vest entirely on the first anniversary of the grant date. In December2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved the accelerated vesting of all
unvested and out-of-the-money stock options with an exercise price per share of $875 or higher.
As a result, approximately 662,000 stock options vested immediately. The primary purpose of the
modification was to avoid recognizing an expense in future financial statements. This modification
to the stock option terms was accounted for under the provisions of APB No25 and its related
interpretations and did not result in the recognition of any compensation cost. 60 Table of Contents As of December31, 2006, the issued and outstanding options denominated in Canadian dollars

The weighted average remaining contractual lives of U.S. and Canadian exercisable options as
of December31, 2006 were 21years and 11years, respectively. During the year ended December31, 2006, the total intrinsic value of options exercised,
defined as the excess fair value of the underlying stock over the exercise price of the options,
was approximately $08million. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No123R, pro forma information regarding net income
and earnings per share was required by SFAS No123 and has been included in Note 2 to the
financial statements. The Company granted 19million options during the year ended December31,
2006 with a fair value of $52million 2005 $06million; 2004 $49million. The fair value
of 61 Table of Contents TLCVisions options granted was estimated at the date of grant for employee options and at the
measurement date for non-employee options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following weighted average assumptions: risk free interest rate of 448%, 399% and 284% for 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively; no dividends; volatility factors of the expected market price of
TLCVisions common shares of 060, 075 and 075 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively; and a
weighted average expected option life of 41, 25 and 25years for 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility on the Companys common stock.
The risk-free interest rate was based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of grant. The
dividend yield on the Companys common stock is assumed to be zero since the Company has not paid
dividends and has no current plans to do so in the future. The expected life was primarily based on
historical exercise patterns of option holders. Share Repurchases During 2005, the Company repurchased and retired 20million common shares for $159million
completing its previously announced 20million share repurchase program. 17. INCOME TAXES During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company determined that there is sufficient evidence to
support a partial recognition of certain deferred tax assets. This determination was based on many
factors including positive taxable income forecasted in future periods, the trend of historical
taxable income and other relevant factors. The Companys determination of the amount of valuation allowance to release is based primarily
on expected taxable income in future years. However, due to an uncertainty of future earnings in
later years caused by the change in the Companys business model currently in process, uncertainty
in the overall industry, and other factors, the valuation allowance release of $72million relates
only to the net operating loss carryforwards forecasted to be utilized during 2007. Of the $72
million release, $53million increased the income tax benefit and $19million reduced goodwill. During the second quarter of 2006, the Company completed a comprehensive Internal Revenue Code
IRC Section382 study to determine the specific limitations related to certain net operating
loss carryforwards. The results of that study indicate that the availability of the Companys net
operating loss carryforwards each year are greater than its previous estimate. Based on the results
of this study, the Company recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment for its change in estimate to
properly reflect income taxes. The adjustment recorded in 2006 for the change in estimate includes
a $34million increase to income tax benefit of which $09million related to periods prior to
2006. In addition, the adjustment for the change in estimate decreased goodwill, common stock, and
income taxes payable by $39million, $48million and $25million, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company completed an analysis to determine the
availability of interest deductions related to intercompany debt transactions with a Hungarian
Offshore Company. The results of this study indicate that the availability of the Companys
interest deductions in accordance with IRC Section 163j are greater than its previous estimate.
Based on the results of this study, the Company recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment for its
change in estimate to properly reflect income taxes. The adjustment recorded in 2006 for the change
in estimate includes a $15million increase to income tax benefit of which $19million related to
periods prior to 2006. In addition, the adjustment for the change in estimate increased goodwill by
$15million. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows

62 Table of Contents As of December31, 2006, the Company has net operating losses available for carryforward for
income tax purposes of approximately $2238million, which may be available to reduce taxable
income in future years.
The U.S.
carryforward losses of $1780million expire between 2008 and 2024.
The Canadian and United Kingdom carryforward losses can only be utilized by
the source company. The United Kingdom carryforward losses of $74million relate to United Kingdom
operations that the Company has ceased. As such, the Company does not expect to utilize these
losses. The Canadian carryforward losses of $384million expire between 2007 and 2016. Of the total valuation allowance, approximately $104million and $144 million will be recorded directly to
equity and as a reduction to goodwill, respectively, if and when those portions of the deferred tax assets are realized and the associated valuation
allowance is reversed. During 2006 and 2005, the Company reversed $49million and $22 million, respectively, of the valuation allowance
directly to goodwill. The differences between the provision for income taxes and the amount computed by applying the
statutory Canadian income tax rate to income before income taxes were as follows

The Company has established accruals for certain tax contingencies for exposures associated
with tax deductions and return filing positions which may be challenged. The tax contingency
accruals are adjusted quarterly in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress
of tax audits, case law and statute of limitations. A number of years may elapse before a
particular matter is resolved. The Company believes its tax contingency accruals are adequate to
address known tax contingencies. Tax contingency accruals are recorded in accrued liabilities in
the balance sheets. 63 Table of Contents 18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments The Company leases certain center facilities under operating leases with terms generally of
five to ten years. Certain leases contain rent escalation clauses and free rent periods that are
charged to rent expense on a straight-line basis. The leases usually contain renewal clauses at the
Companys option at fair market value. For the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 total
rent expense, including minimum and contingent payments, was $91million, $78million and $81
million, respectively. As of December31, 2006, the Company has commitments relating to
non-cancellable operating leases for rental of office space and equipment, which require future
minimum payments aggregating approximately $283million. Future minimum payments over the next
five years and thereafter are as follows

As of December31, 2006, the Company had commitments related to long-term marketing contracts
which require payments totaling $20million in each of the years ending December31, 2007 and
2008. The Companys wholly owned subsidiary, MSS, is the U.S. distributor of the Foresee
PHPTM, a diagnostic piece of equipment utilized by optometrists and
ophthalmologists for the early detection of wet age-related macular degeneration. MSS has
inventory purchase commitments related to the Foresee PHPTM totaling $36
million, $54million and $73million in 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Legal Contingencies The Company is subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of its
business, which may or may not be covered by insurance. These matters include, without limitation,
professional liability, employee-related matters and inquiries and investigations by governmental
agencies. While the ultimate results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the
Company believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on
its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Regulatory Tax Contingencies TLCVision operates in 48 states and two Canadian provinces and is subject to various federal,
state and local income, payroll, unemployment, property, franchise, capital, sales and use tax on
its operations, payroll, assets and services. TLCVision endeavors to comply with all such
applicable tax regulations, many of which are subject to different interpretations, and has hired
outside tax advisors who assist in the process. Many states and other taxing authorities have been
interpreting laws and regulations more aggressively to the detriment of taxpayers such as TLCVision
and its customers. TLCVision believes that it has adequate provisions and accruals in its financial
statements for tax liabilities, although it cannot predict the outcome of future tax assessments. 19. SEGMENT INFORMATION The Company has four reportable segments: refractive, mobile cataract, optometric franchising
and age-related macular degeneration AMD. The refractive segment provides the majority of the
Companys revenue and is in the business of providing corrective laser surgery specifically related
to refractive disorders, such as myopia nearsightedness, hyperopia farsightednessand
astigmatism. This segment is comprised of laser centers and the fixed and mobile access business.
The remaining reportable segments comprise the Other Healthcare Services business and include the
mobile cataract, the optometric franchising and AMD segments. The mobile cataract segment provides
surgery specifically for the treatment of cataracts. The optometric franchising segment provides
marketing, practice development and purchasing power to independently-owned and operated optometric
practices in the United States. The AMD segment includes the Companys interest in OccuLogix. The
AMD segment is pursuing commercial applications for specific eye diseases including dry age-related
macular degeneration, glaucoma and dry-eye. In addition, the Company has an accumulation of
businesses that manage cataract and secondary care centers. None of these businesses meet the
quantitative criteria to be disclosed separately as a reportable segment and are included in
Other for segment disclosure purposes. Corporate depreciation 64 Table of Contents and amortization of $26million, $20million and $20million for 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, is included in corporate operating expenses. For purposes of the depreciation and
amortization disclosures shown below, these amounts are included in the Refractive segment.
Similarly, corporate assets and additions to fixed assets and intangibles are included in the
Refractive segment for purposes of the disclosures shown below. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates performance based on certain components
including revenues, marketing and other operating expenses, minority interests and earnings from
equity investments. Segment profit is exclusive of general corporate expenses, net interest expense
and income taxes. The Companys reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products
and services. They are managed separately because each business requires different management and
marketing strategies. The Companys reportable segments are as follows

20. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable and
accrued liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term maturities of these
instruments. The fair value of the Companys auction rate securities equals cost due to the short time
period between the reset dates for the interest rates. As of December31, 2006, the carrying value and fair value of the Companys long-term debt,
excluding capital lease obligations, was $95million and $88million, respectively. As of
December31, 2005, the carrying value and fair value of the Companys long-term debt, excluding
capital lease obligations, was $103million and $95million, respectively. The fair value of the
Companys long-term debt was estimated by discounting the amount of future cash flows associated
with the respective debt instruments using the Companys current incremental rate of borrowing for
similar debt instruments. The carrying value of the Companys cost method investments as of December31, 2006 and 2005
was $36million and $16million, respectively. The fair value of the Companys cost method
investments was not estimated as there were no identified events or changes in circumstances that
may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investments. In addition, it is not
practicable for the Company to estimate the fair value of its cost method investments since quoted
market prices are not available, and a reasonable estimate of fair value could not be made without
incurring excessive costs. 66 Table of Contents 21. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION Non-cash transactions

Item 4A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the Companys reports under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily
is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures. As of the end of the period covered by the report, the Company carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the
Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15e
and 15d-15e of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were
effective, in all material respects, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the
reports the Company files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and
forms. There have been no significant changes in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December31, 2006 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting as defined in Rule13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance to the Companys management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2006. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSOin Internal
Control Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December31, 2006,
the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2006, has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm who also audited the Companys consolidated financial statements. Ernst Youngs
attestation report on managements assessment of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting is included elsewhere herein. 69 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders of TLC Vision Corporation We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that TLC Vision Corporation maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. TLC Vision Corporations management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that TLC Vision Corporation maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, TLC Vision Corporation
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of TLC Vision Corporation as of
December31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and
stockholders equity for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2006 of TLC
Vision Corporation and our report dated March5, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
