Item8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.    
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    
To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders
Datalink Corporation 
We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Datalink Corporation as of December31, 2010 and 2009, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule of Datalink Corporation listed in a. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Datalink Corporation as of December31, 2010 and 2009, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2010 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein. s/

DATALINK CORPORATION   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:  Description of Business:  Datalink Corporation provides solutions and services that help make data centers more efficient, manageable and responsive to changing
business needs. Focused on mid and large-size companies, we help companies migrate from physical to virtual data centers, ensure data protection and optimize enterprise networks. We derive
our revenues principally from designing, installing and supporting data center solutions. Our solutions and services span three practices: consolidation and virtualization of data center
infrastructures; enhanced data protection; and advanced network infrastructures. We are frequently engaged to provide assistance in the installation of data center solutions and to provide support
services subsequent to the installation. Occasionally, we are engaged for consulting services.  Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standard:  In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB amended the Accounting Standards Codification ASC as summarized
in Accounting Standards Update ASU 2009-14, Software Topic 985: Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements, and ASU
2009-13, Revenue Recognition Topic 605: Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. Under ASU 2009-14, ASC Topic 985 has been
amended to remove from the scope of industry specific revenue accounting guidance for software and software related transactions, tangible products containing software components and
non-software components that function together to deliver the product essential functionality. Under ASU 2009-13, ASC Topic 605 has been amended 1to provide updated
guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated, and the consideration allocated; 2to require an entity to allocate revenue in an
arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price; and 3to eliminate the use of
the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method. The accounting changes summarized in ASU 2009-14 and ASU 2009-13 are
effective for deals entered into after January1, 2011. Adoption may either be on a prospective basis or by retrospective application and we will be adopting prospectively. We are currently
assessing the impact of these amendments to the ASC on its accounting and reporting systems and processes. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of the ASC as of January1,
2011 will have on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that application of these amendments will result in a substantial portion of our revenue and all related cost of sales being
recognized at the time of sale. Currently certain revenue for hardware and essential software and associated cost of sales are deferred at the time of sale and recognized when installation or
configuration services have been completed. As of December31, 2010 we had recorded $88million in revenues shipped but not installed that would have been recognized in the fourth
quarter of 2010 if we had been recognizing revenue upon shipment. 
In
January 2010, the FASB issued revised guidance on disclosures related to fair value measurements. This guidance requires new disclosures about significant transfers in and out of
Level1 and Level2 and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements with respect to Level3 measurements. The guidance also clarifies existing fair
value disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value. The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures became effective for us beginning in the first
quarter of 2010, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements relating to Level3 measurements, which will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2011. We
do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements. 
40  Cash and Cash Equivalents:  Cash equivalents consist principally of money market funds with original maturities of three months or less, are readily convertible to
cash and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. We maintain our cash in bank deposit and money market accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. We have not experienced
any losses in such accounts.  Short-Term Investments:  Our short-term investments consist principally of certificates of deposits. We categorize these investments as not
available-for-sale securities and record them at fair market value. We classify investments with maturities of 90days or less from the date of purchase as cash
equivalents; investments with maturities of greater than 90days from the date of purchase but less than one year generally as short-term investments; and investments with
maturities of greater than one year from the date of purchase generally as long-term investments.  Accounts Receivable, net:  We carry trade receivables at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all
outstanding amounts on a monthly basis. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer financial
condition and credit history and current economic conditions. We write off trade receivables when deemed uncollectible, which is generally in excess of a year past due provided we have no additional
information to suggest we continue to expect customer payment. We record recoveries of trade receivables previously written off when received. We
recorded accounts receivable net of the reserve for doubtful accounts of $204,000 and $629,000 at December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Concentration of Credit Risk:  We had no customers that comprised more than 10% of our sales in 2010, 2009 or 2008.  Inventories:  Inventories, including inventories shipped but not installed, principally consist of data storage products and components, valued at
the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a first-in, first-out FIFO method. We reduced inventories for obsolete and slow moving reserves by $105,000 and $122,000
at December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Property and Equipment:  We state property and equipment, including purchased software, at cost. We provide for depreciation and amortization by charges to
operations using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 2 to 10years. We amortize leasehold improvements on a
straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the underlying lease term. We remove the costs and related accumulated depreciation and amortization on asset
disposals from the 
41 
accounts
and include any gain or loss in operating expenses. We capitalize major renewals and betterments, but charge maintenance and repairs to current operations when incurred.

Goodwill:  We assess the carrying amount of our goodwill for potential impairment annually or more frequently if events or a change in
circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We have only one operating and reporting unit that earns revenues, incurs expenses and makes available discrete financial information for
review by our chief operations decision maker. Accordingly, we complete our goodwill impairment testing on this single reporting unit. Our measurement date is December31, 2010. 
Testing
for goodwill impairment is a two step process. The first step screens for potential impairment. If there is an indication of possible impairment, we must complete the second step
to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of our market capitalization with the
carrying value of our net assets. If our total market capitalization is at or below the carrying value of our net assets, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the
amount of impairment loss we record, if any. We consider goodwill impairment test estimates critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet and the judgment required in
determining fair value amounts.  Valuation of Long-Lived Assets:  We perform an impairment test for finite-lived assets and other long-lived assets, such as fixed assets, whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that we may not recover the carrying value of such assets. We recognize impairment based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value.
We generally measure fair value based on discounted cash flow analyses. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, we identified no triggering events that required us to evaluate the impairment of our
long-lived assets.  Stock Compensation Plans:  We utilize the fair value method of accounting to account for share-based compensation awards. This requires us to measure and
recognize in our statements of operations the expense associated with all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. We use the Black-Scholes model to
determine the fair value of share-based payment awards. Stock-based compensation expense was $15million, $15million and $959,000 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 
42  Income Taxes:  We calculate income taxes using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, we record
deferred income taxes to reflect the tax consequences in future years of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts using enacted tax
rates for the years in which we expect these items to affect taxable income. We establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we expect more likely than not
to realize. Income tax expense benefit is the tax payable receivable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.  Uncertain Tax Positions:  We utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions tax contingencies. The first step
evaluates the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that we will sustain the position on audit, including resolution of
related appeals or litigation processes. The second step measures the tax benefit as the largest amount more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We include interest and
penalties for our tax contingencies in income tax expense. At December31, 2010 and 2009, we had no unrecognized tax benefits which would affect our effective tax rate if recognized.  Use of Estimates:  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include the reserve for doubtful accounts, reserve for
obsolete and slow moving excess
inventory and impairment analysis of goodwill and long-lived assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Revenue Recognition:  Revenue Recognition.We realize revenue from the design, installation and support of data center solutions, which may include hardware,
software and
services. We recognize revenue when we have met our obligations for installation or other services and collectability is reasonably assured. Product Sales.We sell software and hardware products on both a free-standing basis without any services and as data center solutions
bundled with its installation and configuration services bundled arrangements. 
Product Sales Without Service.If we sell a software or hardware product and do not provide any installation or configuration services
with it, we
recognize the product revenues upon shipment. 
Product Sales With Service.If we sell a bundled arrangement, then we defer recognizing any revenue on it until we finish its
installation and/or
configuration work. We account for the hardware, software and service elements of our bundled arrangements by applying the completed contract method. Factors we have considered in applying the
completed contract method of accounting include ithe relatively short duration of our contracts, iithe difficulty of estimating our revenues on a
percentage-of-completion method and iiiour use of acceptance provisions on larger bundled arrangements. 
Service Sales.In addition to installation and configuration services that are part of our bundled arrangements described above, our
service sales
include customer support contracts and consulting 
43  services.
On our balance sheet, deferred revenue relates to service sales for which our customer has paid us or has been invoiced but for which we have not yet performed the applicable services. 
Customer Support Contracts.When we sell hardware and/or software products to our customers, we enter into service contracts with them.
These
contracts are support service agreements. A majority of the time, our internal support desk first assists the customer by performing an initial technical triage to determine the source of the problem
and whether we can direct the customer on how to fix the problem. If we cannot solve the problem, we transfer the customer to the manufacturer or its designated service organization. 
When
we do not provide first call assistance, usually because the manufacturer has not authorized us to do so, our customers call the manufacturer or its designated service
organization directly for both the initial technical triage and any follow-up assistance. If the customer calls us first, we transfer the customer to the third party. 
In
both scenarios above, we purchase third party support contracts from the manufacturers for their services. In accordance with our agreements, and consistent with standard industry
practice, we prepay the third party based on its list price for maintenance on the specific hardware or software products we have sold, less our negotiated discounts with the third party. Terms are
generally net 30days. If we provide the initial first call services our discounts off of list price are more substantial. In all cases, we are the primary obligor in the transaction. The
customer ultimately holds us responsible for fulfillment of the third party support contracts and we bear credit risk in the event of nonpayment by the customer. 
We
report customer support contract revenue on a gross basis as there are sufficient indicators in accumulation that we should be reporting these revenues on a gross basis in accordance
with ASC Topic 605-45, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principle versus Net as an Agent formerly EITF No99-19. We
usually present quotations for maintenance arrangements to our customers without differentiating as to whether we, or a third party, are providing the service. Accordingly, we are, from our customers'
perspectives, the primary obligor on our maintenance arrangements. We directly enter into the agreements with our customers to provide maintenance services. In all cases, we set the price to our
customer for the maintenance arrangements, whether or not we provide our first call services, and bill our customers for the maintenance arrangement. We owe various third parties regardless of whether
we collect from our customer. We are also contractually obligated to provide or arrange to provide these underlying support services to our customers in the
unlikely event that the manufacturer or its designated service organization, fails to perform according to the terms of our contract. When
we sell a service contract as part of a bundled arrangement, we use vendor specific objective evidence to allocate revenue to the service contract element. In all cases, we defer
revenues and direct costs resulting from our service contracts and amortize them into operations over the term of the contracts, which are generally twelve months. We defer customer support costs
under FTB 90-1 ASC 310 and the FAQs under SAB101 and SAB104. The deferred costs we capitalize consist of direct and incremental costs we prepay to third parties for
direct support to our customers under our contract terms. We defer our customer support contract revenues and their related costs because significant obligations remain after contract execution. For
example, we provide routine help desk assistance to our customers and assist them in contacting our vendors for additional support services. 
Consulting Services.Some of our customers engage us to analyze their existing data center architectures and offer our recommendations.
Other
customers engage us to assist them on-site with extended data center infrastructure projects, to support their data center environments and to help with long-term data center
design challenges. For these types of consulting services that do not include the sale of hardware or software products, we recognize revenues as we perform these services. 
44  Net Earnings Per Share:  We compute basic net earnings per share using the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted net earnings per share include
the effect of common stock equivalents, if any, for each period. Diluted per share amounts assume the conversion, exercise or issuance of all potential common stock instruments unless their effect is
anti-dilutive. The following table computes basic and diluted net earnings per share:

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:  At December31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying values of current financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, other current assets, accrued liabilities, other current liabilities and notes due to seller of acquired business approximated their
market values, based on the short-term maturities of these instruments. We
use the three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair values. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level1 measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level3 measurements. The three levels of the fair
value hierarchy are described below: Level1Unadjusted quoted prices available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities at
the measurement date. 
45  Level2Significant other observable inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices
included in Level1, either directly or indirectly.  
Level3Significant unobservable inputs that we cannot corroborate by observable market data and thus
reflect the use of significant management judgment. We generally determine these values using pricing models based on assumptions our management believes other market participants would make. The
fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair
value hierarchy, we determine the fair value measurement based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a
particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The following table sets forth, by level
within the fair value hierarchy, the accounting of our financial assets and/or liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis as of December31, 2010 according to the valuation techniques we
used to determine their fair values.

2.Acquisitions  Networking Solutions Division of Cross Telecom  On October1, 2009, we acquired the networking solutions division of Minneapolis-based Cross Telecom Cross, which
qualified as a business combination. We completed an asset purchase of $20million paid in cash. Simultaneously, Cross entered into an agreement with us to purchase at least
$18million of networking products and services from us over the next three years. Cross has agreed to pay any shortfall between customer purchases and the guaranteed annual purchase amount.
We believed that we would meet the revenue targets and accordingly, we determined that the reverse earn-out had no fair value at the date of this business combination or in any subsequent
periods prior to the settlement date. We determined that this earn-out liability is a Level3 fair value measurement within the FASB fair
value hierarchy, and such liability is adjusted to fair value at each reporting date, with the adjustment reflected in operating expenses. The
first year of the three year reverse earn-out agreement came to an end in September 2010. Per the services agreement any shortfall between customer purchases and the
guaranteed annual purchase amount would be payable by Cross at that time. At September30, 2010, there was a shortfall between customer purchases and the guaranteed annual purchase amount of
$503,000. As discussed above, on October1, 2009 we determined that the revenue targets would be met and the reverse earn-out had no fair value. Therefore, the shortfall amount of
$503,000 represented a change in fair value of the acquisition date reverse earn-out and in accordance with ASC 805-30-35 was classified as other income within
operating expenses on our statement of operations. We believe that the revenue targets for the next two years will be met and accordingly the reverse earn-out was determined to have no
fair value at December31, 2010. 
In
connection with this acquisition, we allocated the total purchase consideration to the net assets acquired, including finite lived intangible assets, based on their respective fair
values at the acquisition date. 
46 
We
paid a premium for the net tangible and identified intangible assets i.e.goodwill acquired in the acquisition over their fair value because we believe this acquisition will
add to our expertise in designing, implementing and managing sophisticated storage, backup and recovery infrastructures. 
The
following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired: 
in thousands  Assets acquired and their fair values Property equipment 47 Finite-lived intangibles 534 Goodwill 1,419 Net purchase price 2,000 
We
allocated the purchase price for the Cross acquisition primarily by comparing our estimated cost to build the assets acquired against purchasing them. This enabled us to determine the
allocation between finite lived intangibles and goodwill. The finite lived intangibles, which consisted of the services agreement and certifications have estimated lives of four and two years,
respectively, and we are amortizing them using the straight line method see Note3. The goodwill we may deduct for tax purposes over a 15year period.  Reseller Business of Incentra,LLC  On December17, 2009, we acquired the reseller business of Incentra, which designs, procures, implements and supports data
center solutions composed of technologies including storage, networking, security and servers from leading manufacturers. We did not acquire Incentra managed services portfolio and related
operations. We accomplished the acquisition through the purchase of substantially all of the assets of Incentra reseller business pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement. Under
the Asset Purchase Agreement, we paid Incentra $138million. We paid $88million at closing in cash, of which we held back $440,000 as security for certain
indemnification obligations of Incentra. In addition, we paid Incentra $50million for the working capital associated with Incentra reseller business through the delivery of
$20million in cash and a $30million secured promissory note paid on March31, 2010. During 2010 the final working capital adjustment was agreed to and the amount held back for
indemnification was released, the net effect was a decrease in the purchase price of $32,000. 
We
estimated the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Incentra' primarily using a discounted cash flow approach with respect to identified intangible assets and
goodwill. We based this approach upon our estimates of future cash flows from the acquired assets and liabilities and utilized a discount rate consistent with the inherent risk associated with the
acquired assets and liabilities assumed. 
The
fair value of the assets acquired included finite lived intangible assets, which consisted of trademarks, order backlog and customer relationships having estimated lives of three
years, one year and eight years, respectively, and goodwill of approximately $40million which will be deductible for tax purposes over a 15year period. We paid a premium over the fair
value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired i.e.goodwill, because we believe this acquisition expands our regional presence and customer portfolio and enables us to
provide our customers with complete data center solutions. We anticipate operational synergies and efficiencies through combined general and administrative and corporate functions. 
47 
As
of December31, 2009, the fair value of the acquired assets was provisional as we had not yet completed our determination of the income tax basis of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed and accordingly deferred income taxes had not been recorded. In addition, during 2010 we finalized the fair value determination for certain working capital assets and liabilities.
Due to the timing of the acquisition closed December 2009, complexities and related integration we did not complete our final fair value assessment until late in 2010. Adjustments to provisional
amounts during the measurement period, that were the result of information that existed as of the acquisition date, require the revision of comparative prior period financial information when reissued
in subsequent financial statements. Accordingly our 2009 balance sheet has been adjusted to account for these changes. The changes resulted in a $523,000 reduction in goodwill and did not impact our
income statement. 
The
following table summarizes the final allocation of the purchase price including measurement period adjustments: 
in thousands  Assets acquired at their fair value Accounts receivable, net 10,699 Inventory 167 Fixed assets 119 Finite-lived intangibles 5,219 Goodwill 4,012 Other assets 250 Total assets acquired 20,466 Liabilities assumed at their fair value Accounts payable 4,603 Deferred maintenance contracts, net 705 Accrued liabilities 1,358 Total liabilities assumed 6,666 Net purchase price 13,800 
The
finite lived intangibles which consisted of trademarks, order backlog and customer relationships have estimated lives of three years, one year and eight years, respectively, and we
are amortizing them using the straight line method see Note3. 
Integration
costs for 2010 and 2009 include salaries, benefits, retention bonuses and severances of exiting employees, some of whom assisted with the initial integration of Incentra. In
addition, transaction costs for 2009 include legal, audit and other outside service fees necessary to complete our acquisition of Incentra, which were expensed. Total integration and transaction costs
were $581,000 and $10million during 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Amortization
expense related to finite-lived intangible assets for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $26million, $843,000 and $711,000, respectively. Amortization expense in 2010 and 2009
relates primarily to our acquisitions of MCSI in January 2007, the networking solutions division of Cross in October 2009 and the reseller business of Incentra in December 2009. Amortization expense
in 2008 relates primarily to our acquisition of MCSI in January 2007. The finite lived intangibles we acquired related to the reseller business of Incentra consisted of trademarks, order backlog and
customer relationships and have estimated lives of three years, one year and 8years, respectively. The finite lived intangibles we acquired related to the networking solutions division of
Cross consisted of the services agreement and certifications and have estimated lives of four years and 2years, respectively. The finite lived intangibles we acquired related to our
acquisition of MCSI consisted of customer relationships and backlog and have estimated lives of six years and two months, respectively. We are amortizing all finite lived
intangibles using the straight line method. Expected amortization in each of the next five years is as follows:

Our
fiscal years 2008 and 2009 are under IRS examination. The IRS is examining our change in accounting methodology for deferred maintenance contracts. The timing of the
resolution of this examination, as well as the amount and timing of any related settlement, is uncertain. We believe that before the end of fiscal year 2011, it is reasonably possible that this audit
will conclude. We believe our reserves are adequate to cover any potential assessments that may result from this examination. 
The
tax expense for 2010 and 2009 consists of the following:

In
assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that we will realize some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. As of
December31, 2010, we have federal net operating carryforwards of approximately $46million which fully expire in 2029. As of December31, 2010, we have state net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $69million, which are available to offset future state taxable income. If not used, the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire between 2013 and
2028. For 2010 and 2009, respectively, we recorded approximately $15,800 and $1,300 to equity for tax benefits associated with the vesting of restricted stock and the exercise of stock options. For
2008, we recorded approximately $13,000 to equity for tax expenses associated with the exercise of stock options. In future periods of taxable earnings, we expect to report an income tax provision
using an effective tax rate of approximately 40% to 44%. 
51   5.Lease Commitments: 
Our corporate headquarters including our principal technical and support services operations, are located in an office and warehouse facility in Chanhassen,
Minnesota. As of December31, 2010, our other 21 leased locations, housing sales and technical staff, are small to medium sized offices. We have regional hubs located in the Northeast, South,
Mid Central, North Central and West.

In
December 2004, we agreed to sublease approximately 52,000 of the 106,000 square feet we then occupied as our corporate headquarters in Chanhassen, Minnesota. The initial sublease term
is co-terminal with the original lease ending in April 2012. The sublessee pays us rent ranging from approximately $55,000 per month at the beginning of the term to approximately $60,000
per month by the end of the term. The rent includes the costs of common area management, common systems repairs, real estate taxes and standard utilities. Total
rent expense, net of sublease income of $663,000, $663,000 and $663,000 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, is as follows:

the plan. Since April 2006, we have matched 50% of an employee contribution up to the first 6% of an employee eligible compensation. The cost of our contributions to the 401k portion of the plan
for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $762,000, $640,000 and $568,000, respectively.

the 2009 Plan. In May 2010, our shareholders approved an increase in the number of shares for possible issuance under the 2009 Plan from 1,000,000 shares to 1,500,000 shares. Awards under the 2009
Plan may consist of options non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, or SARs, restricted stock units, performance units, dividend 
52 
equivalents,
annual incentive awards and other share-based awards as determined by our Compensation Committee. The terms and conditions of each award are set in an award agreement as determined by the
Compensation Committee. As of December31, 2010, there were 482,943 shares available for grant under the 2009 Plan. In
August 2000, we adopted our 2000 Director Stock Option Plan the Director Plan. The terms of the Director Plan as most recently amended in May 2007, allow for stock option grants
to non-employee members of the Board of Directors. We have reserved 550,000 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to the Director Plan, 161,034 of which were available for grant as

Stock Options:  We had no stock option grants in 2010. In
December 2009, we awarded 25,000 stock options to one of our managers. The stock options vest over three years with one-third vesting each year if the individual is still
employed by us. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options. The weighted-average fair value per option at the date of grant was $235. We estimated the
fair value for the stock option grant with the following average assumptions: 
2009  Risk-free interest rates
27 Expected dividend yield
0 Expected volatility factor
67 Expected option holding period
6years 
In
July 2009, we awarded 450,000 stock options to our president and chief executive officer. The stock options vest 25% per year over a term of four years, provided he continues
employment with us through each relevant vesting date. Unvested stock options will immediately vest upon a change of control of us as defined in his employment agreement but only if he iis
continuously employed to the date of the change of control, iithe change of control price as defined in the employment agreement exceeds $350 per share, iiiour compensation
committee authorizes the acceleration and vesting of the options and ivsuch acceleration and vesting will not cause the option to be subject to the adverse consequences described in
Section409A of the Internal Revenue Code. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options. The weighted-average fair value per option at the date of
grant was $215. We estimated the fair value for the stock option grant with the following weighted average assumptions: 
2009  Risk-free interest rates
28 Expected dividend yield
0 Expected volatility factor
66 Expected option holding period
6years 
In
February 2008, we awarded 200,000 and 115,000 stock options to executive officers and managers, respectively. The stock options vest over three years with one-third
vesting each year if the individual is still employed by us. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options. The weighted-average fair values per option at
the date of grant were $252. We estimated the fair value for the stock option grants with the following weighted average assumptions: 
2008  Risk-free interest rates
29 Expected dividend yield
0 Expected volatility factor
71 Expected option holding period
6years 
The
risk-free rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of our stock options. Expected volatility is based on the historical
volatility of our share price for the period prior to the option grant equivalent to the expected holding period of the options. The expected holding period and dividend yield are based on historical
experience. Total stock-based compensation expense related to stock options was $335,000 at December31, 2010. Unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to stock options was
$660,000 at December31, 2010.

Item2.Controls and Procedures     aEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer principal executive officer and our Chief Financial Officer principal
financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule13a-15b under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Based on their review of our disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective at December31, 2010
to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial
officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specific in the
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.  bManagement Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2009. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based
on our evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2010. 
This
Annual Report on Form10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial

has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
