REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.     We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the
consolidated financial statement schedule of ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. a
Delaware corporation, formerly SPI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and subsidiaries
listed in the index on page 29 of this Form 10-K. These consolidated financial
statements and the consolidated financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company Management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by Management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
The Company had certain transactions, through, November 1, 1994, with
previously Affiliated Corporations as more fully described in Note 4. Whether 
the terms of these transactions would have been the same had they been 
between wholly unrelated parties cannot be determined.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994
and 1993, the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994 in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, in our opinion,
the consolidated financial statement schedule referred to above, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information required to
be included therein.
The Company is a defendant in various class action lawsuits the 1995,
1994 and 1987 Actions, as defined and discussed in Note 7. The ultimate
outcome of these lawsuits cannot presently be determined. Accordingly, no
provision for any liability that may result has been made in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements. COOPERS & LYBRAND L.L.P.

ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1994 1. ORGANIZATION AND BACKGROUND     On November 1, 1994, the shareholders of ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
ICN, SPI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. SPI, Viratek, Inc. Viratek, and ICN
Biomedicals, Inc. Biomedicals collectively, the Predecessor Companies
approved the Merger of the Predecessor Companies, the Merger. On November
10, 1994 effective November 1, 1994, SPI, ICN and Viratek merged into ICN
Merger Corp., and Biomedicals merged into ICN Subsidiary Corp. a wholly-owned
subsidiary of ICN Merger Corp. In conjunction with the Merger, ICN Merger
Corp. was renamed ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. New ICN or the Company.
The Merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
Additionally, for accounting purposes, SPI was treated as the acquiring company
and as a result, the Company has reported the historic financial data of SPI in
its financial results and includes the results of ICN, Viratek and Biomedicals
since November 1, 1994.
SPI was incorporated on November 30, 1981, as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of ICN and was 39%-owned by ICN prior to the Merger. Viratek and
Biomedicals were 63%-owned and 69%-owned by ICN, respectively, prior to the
Merger. 2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements for 1994 include
the full year financial results of SPI and majority owned subsidiaries, which
includes 75% ownership in ICN Galenika See Note 12, and the financial results
of ICN, Viratek, and Biomedicals, from the effective date of the Merger. The
consolidated financial statements for 1993 and 1992 reflect the financial
results of SPI. Investments in 20% through 50% owned affiliated companies are
included under the equity method where the Company exercises significant
influence over operating and financial affairs. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements reflect the elimination of all significant intercompany
account balances and transactions.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 1994 and 1993, includes
$36,124,000 and $1,247,000, respectively, of certificate of deposits which have
maturities of three months or less. For purposes of the Statements of Cash
Flows, the Company considers highly liquid investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount
of those assets approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these
instruments.
Marketable Securities
In January 1994, the Company adopted SFAS No. 115 Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. This statement addresses
the accounting and reporting for investments in equity securities that have
readily determinable fair values and for all investments in debt securities.
Those investments are to be classified as either held-to-maturity, trading
securities, or available-for-sale. The Company has classified its investment
in corporate bond securities, with maturities ranging from 1999 to 2003, and
its investment in equity                    35

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1994 securities as available-for-sale. The contractual maturity value of these
corporate bond securities is approximately $33,700,000. The fair value of the
Company investment in corporate bond securities is approximately $29,155,000.
The fair value of these corporate bond securities is determined based on quoted
market prices. Gross unrealized holding losses have been calculated on the
specific identification method. Changes in market values of equity securities
are reflected as unrealized gains or losses directly in stockholders' equity,
as required, and accordingly have no effect on the consolidated statements of
income. The adoption of SFAS No. 115 did not result in a cumulative effect
adjustment in the consolidated statements of income.
Marketable securities had an aggregate cost at December 31, 1993, of
$33,899,000. A valuation allowance in the amount of $1,312,000 has been
recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the portfolio to fair value, which
represents the net unrealized loss included in the determination of net income
for 1993. These investments are used to collateralize a note payable of
$10,000,000.
Inventories
Inventories, which include material, direct labor and factory
overhead, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on a
first-in, first-out FIFO basis.
Property, Plant and Equipment
The Company primarily uses the straight-line method for depreciating
property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives. Buildings and
related improvements are depreciated from 7-50 years, machinery and equipment
from 5-15 years, furniture and fixtures from 4-10 years, and leasehold
improvements are amortized over their useful lives, limited to the life of the
lease.
The Company follows the policy of capitalizing expenditures that
materially increase the lives of the related assets and charges maintenance and
repairs to expense. Upon sale or retirement, the costs and related accumulated
depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the respective accounts, and
the resulting gain or loss is included in income.
Goodwill and Intangibles
The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net
assets acquired at the date of acquisition is included in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets as Goodwill. Goodwill amortization periods are
five years for single product line businesses acquired through November 30,
1986, and 10 to 23 years for certain businesses acquired in 1987, which have
other intangibles patents and trademarks, and whose values and lives can be
reasonably estimated. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of
goodwill including the related amortization periods. The Company determines
whether there has been impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted
future operating income of the acquired entity with the carrying value of the
goodwill.
As a result of the Merger, the Company acquired certain intangible
assets primarily related to patents and customer lists of $14,000,000 after 
certain purchase accounting adjustments, which are being amortized 
over 5 to 10 years, using the straight-line method.
Notes Payable
The Company classifies various borrowings with initial terms of one
year or less as notes payable. At December 31, 1994, these notes, which are
primarily variable rate notes, had average interest rates of 9% in Spain, 7% in
Yugoslavia, 12% in Italy and 16% in the United States on a foreign denominated
obligation. The carrying amount of notes payable approximates fair value due
to the short-term maturity of these instruments. The weighted average interest
rate on short-term borrowings outstanding at December 31, 1994 and 1993 was 9%.                    36

DECEMBER 31, 1994     Foreign Currency Translation
The assets and liabilities of the Company foreign operations, except
those in highly inflationary economies, are translated at the end of period
exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange
rates prevailing during the period. The effects of unrealized exchange rate
fluctuations on translating foreign currency assets and liabilities into U.S.
dollars are accumulated in stockholders' equity. The monetary assets and
liabilities of foreign subsidiaries in highly inflationary economies are
remeasured into U.S. dollars at the year end exchange rates and non-monetary
assets and liabilities at historical rates. In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation,
the Company has included in operating income all foreign exchange gains and
losses arising from foreign currency transactions and the effects of foreign
exchange rate fluctuations on subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary
economies. The gains losses included in operations from foreign exchange
translation and transactions for 1994, 1993 and 1992, were $191,000 3,282,000, and $25,039,000, respectively.
Income Taxes
In January 1993, the Company adopted SFAS 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. SFAS 109 requires that an asset and liability approach be used in the
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequence of events that have been recognized in the Company financial
statements or tax returns. The adoption of SFAS 109 in 1993 did not result in
a cumulative effect adjustment in the consolidated statements of income.
Per Share Information
Per share information is based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding and the dilutive effect of common share equivalents.
Common share equivalents represent shares issuable for outstanding options, on
the assumption that the proceeds would be used to repurchase shares in the open
market.
In January 1993, SPI issued a fourth quarter 1992 stock dividend of
2%. During 1993, SPI issued quarterly stock dividends which totaled 6%. In
1994, SPI and the Company issued quarterly stock dividends and distributions
which totaled 48%. In March 1995, the Company declared a first quarter 1995
stock distribution of 17%. All share and per share amounts used in computing
earnings per share have been restated to reflect these stock dividends and
distributions.

DECEMBER 31, 1994 3.    ACQUISITION OF THE PREDECESSOR COMPANIES
On November 10, 1994, SPI, ICN and Viratek merged into New ICN, and
Biomedicals merged into ICN Subsidiary Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of New
ICN. The Merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
Additionally, for accounting purposes, SPI was treated as the acquiring company
and as a result, the Company has reported the historical financial data of SPI
in its financial results and the results of ICN, Viratek and Biomedicals have
been included with the results of the Company since the effective date of the
Merger.
As part of the Merger, the Company issued approximately 6,476,770
common shares valued on November 10, 1994 at $2075 per share, which was the
publicly traded price for SPI common shares at that date. Accordingly, the
purchase price, including direct acquisition costs of $3,654,000, has been
allocated to the estimated fair value of the net assets, including amounts
ascribed to purchased research and development costs which was charged to
operations immediately following the consummation of the Merger. The
$2,313,000 excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired and amounts
allocated to acquired research and development over the purchase price has been
proportionately allocated as a reduction of non-current assets acquired.
The purchase price allocation related to the Merger is preliminary,
pending resolution of a pre-acquisition contingency associated with certain
consolidated class actions, the 1987 Actions, entitled In re Paine Weber
Securities Litigation; In re ICN/Viratek Securities Litigation against ICN and
Viratek. See Note 7
The preliminary purchase price allocation, as of the effective date of
the Merger, is summarized as follows in thousands

costs, primarily patents and trademarks. The $221,000,000 which represents the
valuation of acquired in-process research and development for which no
alternative use exists, has been charged to operations immediately upon
consummation of the Merger in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.                    38

4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS General
Prior to the Merger, ICN controlled Biomedicals and Viratek through
stock ownership and board representation and was affiliated with SPI. Certain
officers of ICN occupied similar positions with SPI, Biomedicals, and Viratek
and were affiliated with SPI. Prior to the Merger, ICN, SPI, Biomedicals, and
Viratek engaged in certain transactions with each other.
Prior to the Merger, an Oversight Committee of the Board of Directors
of ICN, SPI, Biomedicals and Viratek reviewed transactions between or among
the affiliated corporations to determine whether a conflict of interest existed
with respect to a particular transaction and the manner in which such a
conflict could be resolved. The Oversight Committee had advisory authority
only and made recommendations to the Board of Directors of each of the
Affiliated Corporations. The Oversight Committee consisted of one
non-management director of each Affiliated Corporation and a non-voting
chairman. The significant related party transactions were reviewed and
recommended for approval by the Oversight Committee and approved by the
respective Board of Directors. As a result of the Merger, the Oversight
Committee has been eliminated.
Royalty Agreements
Effective December 1, 1990, SPI entered into a royalty agreement with
Viratek whereby a royalty of 20% of all sales of VirazoleR was paid to
Viratek. Sales of VirazoleR, for purposes of determining royalties to
Viratek, for 1994, 1993 and 1992 were $35,855,000, $29,515,000 and $27,240,000,
respectively, which generated royalties to Viratek for 1994, 1993 and 1992 of
$7,171,000, $5,903,000 and $5,448,000, respectively. As a result of the
Merger, the Company is no longer required to pay future royalties on
VirazoleR.                    39

ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1994     Beginning in 1993, under an amended agreement between SPI and the
employer of a director of Viratek, SPI was required to pay $2000 for each new
aerosol drug delivery device manufactured. In connection with the Merger, the
Company assumed the agreement under the same terms as SPI. Such royalties for
1994 were $16,000. Also, pursuant to this agreement, the Company is required
to pay a 2% royalty on all sales of VirazoleR in aerosolized form. Such
royalties for 1994, 1993 and 1992 were $725,000, $422,000 and $430,000,
respectively.
SPI marketed products under license from ICN for the treatment of
myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy. ICN
charged SPI royalties at the rate of 9% of net sales. Effective September 1,
1990, SPI prepaid royalties to ICN in the amount of $9,590,000, which was
recorded in Other Assets and is being amortized using the straight-line method
over fifteen years.
Beginning in December 1986 and prior to the Merger, SPI began selling
Brown Pharmaceuticals, Inc. products under license from ICN. ICN charged SPI
royalties at the rate of 8-1/2% of net sales. During 1994, 1993 and 1992, SPI
paid ICN $298,000, $218,000 and $65,000, respectively, in royalties under this
agreement. As a result of the Merger, the Company is no longer required to pay
a royalty to ICN for sales of Brown Pharmaceuticals, Inc. products.
Cost Allocations
Prior to the Merger, the affiliated corporations occupied ICN
facility in Costa Mesa, California. The accompanying consolidated statements
of income include charges for rent from ICN of $230,000 for 1994 and $279,000
for each of years 1993 and 1992. In addition, the costs of common services
such as maintenance, purchasing and personnel were incurred by SPI and
allocated to ICN, Viratek and Biomedicals based on services utilized. The
total of such costs were $2,207,000 for 1994, $2,584,000 in 1993 and $2,556,000
in 1992 of which $1,579,000, $1,733,000 and $1,679,000 were allocated to the
affiliated corporations, respectively. It is management belief that the
methods used and amounts allocated for facility costs and common services were
reasonable based upon the usage by the respective companies.
Investment Policy
Prior to the Merger, ICN and SPI had a policy covering intercompany
advances and interest rates, and the types of investments marketable equity
securities, high yield bonds, etc. to be made by ICN and its subsidiaries.
Under this policy, excess cash held by ICN subsidiaries was transferred to
ICN and, in turn, cash advances were made to ICN subsidiaries to fund certain
transactions. ICN charged or credited interest based on the amounts invested
or advanced, current interest rates and the cost of capital. During 1994, 1993
and 1992, SPI was charged interest of $359,000, $800,000 and $1,195,000,
respectively.
Debt and Equity Transactions
During 1993, ICN sold 1,618,200 shares of SPI common stock for an
aggregate sales price of $19,995,000 in open market transactions and privately
negotiated sales. During 1992, ICN sold 690,000 shares of SPI common stock
for an aggregate sales price of $13,786,000 in open market transactions and
privately negotiated sales.
On November 15, 1993, SPI issued 200,000 shares of common stock to ICN
in exchange for reducing its debt outstanding to ICN by $3,075,000. The value
of the shares issued was based on the quoted share price on the transaction
date.
During 1992, ICN Galenika sold 1,200,000 shares of SPI stock for
proceeds of $30,822,000. Net of amounts attributable to minority interest, the
sale of the stock increased paid-in-capital and decreased treasury stock by
$28,628,000.                    40

5. INCOME TAXES     In January 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes. SFAS 109 is an asset and liability approach that requires the
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequence of events that have been recognized in the Company financial
statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, SFAS 109
generally considers all expected future events other than enactment of changes
in the tax law or rates. Previously, the Company used the SFAS 96 asset and
liability approach that gave no recognition to future events other than the
recovery of assets and settlement of liabilities at their carrying amounts.
The adoption of SFAS 109 did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment in
the consolidated statements of income.

The current federal tax provision has not been reduced for the tax
benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options. The tax
benefit from the exercise of employee stock options was credited to paid-in
capital in 1994, 1993, and 1992, in the amounts of $134,000, $727,000, and
$956,000, respectively.
In connection with the Merger, the Company acquired approximately
$226,000,000 of net operating loss carryforwards NOLs. Included in the
total acquired net operating loss carryforward is approximately $191,000,000 of
domestic NOLs and approximately $35,000,000 of foreign NOLs. The utilization
of acquired NOLs is subject to a variety of limitations including an annual
limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 on the use of such NOLs to
reduce the taxable income of the Company. The Company NOLs expire beginning
1995 to 2009.
Generally, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the
availability of NOLs that can be used to reduce taxable income after certain
substantial ownership changes of a corporation. The Merger resulted in an
ownership change with respect to the acquired companies. Consequently, the
Company annual limitation on utilization of the acquired domestic NOLs is
approximately $33,000,000 per year.
Included in the total acquired NOL is approximately $9,800,000 of
domestic NOLs acquired by Biomedicals from Flow Laboratories Flow. Under
the terms of the Flow acquisition, 50 percent of the tax benefit from the
utilization of these acquired NOLs in excess of $500,000 is payable to the
former shareholders of Flow. Under the terms of the Flow acquisition
agreement, utilization is determined on a with and without basis.
In accordance with SFAS 109, any realization of acquired tax benefits must
be used to 1 reduce goodwill, 2 reduce acquired noncurrent intangible assets
and 3 reduce income tax expense. Consequently, the Company post-1994 income
tax expense will not reflect the recognition of acquired tax benefits until all
acquired intangible assets have been reduced to zero. At December 31, 1994,
the balance of acquired noncurrent intangibles was approximately $13,500,000.                    42

limitation of $540,000.

management intends to reinvest those undistributed earnings in the foreign
operations. Included in consolidated retained earnings at December 31, 1994,
is approximately $61,000,000 of accumulated earnings of foreign operations that
would be subject to U.S. income or foreign withholding taxes, if and when
repatriated.
The Company is under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for
the tax years ended November 30, 1991, 1990, 1989, and 1988. Currently, the
proposed adjustments, if upheld, would not result in a significant additional
tax liability and would not result in a significant reduction in NOLs available
to the Company.

DECEMBER 31, 1994 Litigation
The Predecessor Companies were parties to a number of lawsuits. As a
result of the Merger, the Company has assumed all of the Predecessor Companies'
liabilities with respect to such lawsuits.
In February and March 1995, eighteen actions were filed which named
the Company, its Board of Directors, Milan Panic and several other officers of
the Company, in various combinations, as defendants the Defendants the
1995 Actions. Eleven of the actions purport to be securities class actions,
one is an individual securities action and six purport to be derivative suits.
In general, all of the securities class actions allege that the
Company made various deceptive and untrue statements of material fact and
omitted to state material facts in connection with information it received from
the FDA regarding the Company NDA for the use of VirazoleR for the
treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Plaintiffs also allege that various officers
of the Company traded on inside information. The purported securities class
actions and the individual securities action assert claims for alleged
violations of Sections 10b and 20a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, common law fraud, misrepresentation and
negligent misrepresentation. They seek unspecified compensatory and punitive
damages, attorneys' fees and costs, injunctive and equitable relief, and
disgorgement. With respect to the purported securities class actions,
plaintiffs seek certification of classes of persons who purchased ICN common
stock, ICN debentures and ICN call options or sold ICN put options. The
securities class actions seek certification for differing time periods, the
longest alleged time period being from June 2, 1994 through February 17, 1995.
With respect to the purported derivative suits, plaintiffs assert
claims for breach of fiduciary duty, intentional breach of fiduciary duty,
negligent breach of fiduciary duty, breach of the fiduciary duty of candor,
waste of corporate assets, constructive fraud, disgorgement, gross
mismanagement, abuse of control and unjust enrichment. In these actions
plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys' fee
and costs and injunctive and equitable relief.
The Company has had preliminary discussions with the attorneys for
plaintiffs who have suggested that an Amended Consolidated Complaint,
encompassing the 1995 Actions, be filed in the United States District Court for
the Central District of California. If this consolidation occurs, as
Defendants currently expect, Defendants will have at least 30 days from the
filing of the Amended Consolidated Complaint to answer or move. It is not
possible at present for the Company to predict the outcome or the range of
potential loss, if any, that might result from the 1995 Actions. The
Defendants intend to vigorously defend the 1995 Actions.
In response to the allegations contained in the 1995 Actions, the
Board of Directors established a Special Committee of the Board of Directors in
February, 1995 to review the trading of common stock of the Company by
executives and issues surrounding the timely disclosure of information received
from the FDA regarding the Company NDA for the use of Virazole in the
treatment of chronic hepatitis C. The Committee investigation is still in
progress. It is anticipated that the Committee will finalize its report and
present its findings to the Board of Directors in mid-April 1995.
Four lawsuits have been filed with respect to the Merger in the Court
of Chancery in the State of Delaware. Three of these lawsuits, entitled Helmut
Kling v. Milan Panic, et al., Jallath v. Milan Panic, et al., and Amy Hoffman
v. Milan Panic, et al. the 1994 Actions, were filed by stockholders of SPI
and, in the Jallath lawsuit, of Viratek, against ICN, SPI, Viratek in the
Jallath lawsuit and certain directors and officers of ICN, SPI and/or Viratek
including Milan Panic and purport to be class actions on behalf of all
persons who held shares of SPI common stock and, in the Jallath lawsuit,
Viratek common stock. The fourth lawsuit, entitled ~Joice Perry v.                    48

ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1994 Nils O. Johannesson, et. al., was filed by a stockholder of Viratek against
ICN, Viratek and certain directors and officers of ICN, SPI and Viratek
including Milan Panic and purports to be a class action on behalf of all
persons who held shares of Viratek common stock. These suits allege that the
consideration provided to the publicstockholders of SPI and/or Viratek as
applicable in the Merger was unfair and inadequate, and that the defendants
breached their fiduciary duties in approving the Merger and otherwise. The
Company believes that the 1994 Actions are without merit and intends to defend
them vigorously. It is not possible at present for the Company to predict the
outcome or the range of potential loss, if any, that might result from the 1994
Actions.
ICN, SPI and Viratek and certain of their officers and directors
collectively, the ICN Defendants were named defendants in certain
consolidated class actions pending in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York entitled In re Paine Webber Securities Litigation
Case No. 86 Civ. 6776 VLB; In re ICN/Viratek Securities Litigation Case
No. 87 Civ. 4296 VLB collectively the 1987 Actions. In the Third Amended
Consolidated Class Action Complaint, plaintiffs allege that the ICN Defendants
made, or aided and abetted Paine Webber, Inc. Paine Webber in making,
misrepresentations of material fact and omitted to state material facts
concerning the business, financial condition and future prospects of ICN,
Viratek and SPI in certain public announcements, Paine Webber research reports
and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The alleged
misstatements and omissions primarily concern developments regarding
VirazoleR, including the efficacy, safety and market for the drug. The
plaintiffs allege that such misrepresentations and omissions violate Section
10b of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and constitute
common law fraud and misrepresentation. Fact discovery is complete and expert
discovery is virtually complete. Plaintiffs seek the certification of classes
of persons who purchased ICN, Viratek or SPI common stock during the period
January 7, 1986 through April 15, 1987. Oral argument on plaintiffs' motion
for class certification was held on June 2, 1994. To date, no decision has
been rendered. Plaintiffs' damages expert, utilizing assumptions and
methodologies that the ICN Defendants' damages experts find to be inappropriate
under the circumstances, has testified that assuming that classes were
certified for purchasers of ICN, Viratek and SPI common stock for the entire
class periods alleged by plaintiffs, and further assuming that all of the
plaintiffs' allegations were proven, potential damages against ICN, Viratek and
SPI would, in the aggregate, amount to $315,000,000. The ICN Defendants' four
damages experts have testified that damages are zero. On May 4, 1994,
plaintiffs' counsel agreed to stipulate to the dismissal of the aiding and
abetting claim asserted against the ICN Defendants and a formal stipulation
will be submitted to the Court in the near future. On October 20, 1993,
plaintiffs informed the Court that they had reached an agreement to settle with
co-defendant Paine Webber and on July 27, 1994, the settlement was approved by
the court. Management believes that, having extensively reviewed the issues
in the above referenced matters, there are strong defenses and the Company
intends to defend the 1987 Actions vigorously. While the ultimate outcome of
the 1987 Actions cannot be predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable outcome
could have a material adverse effect on the Company, at this time management
does not expect these matters will have a material adverse effect on the
financial position and results of operations of the Company.
In late January 1995, an action was commenced by Deborah Levy against
ICN, SPI, Viratek and Milan Panic. The complaint asserts causes of action for
sex discrimination and harassment, and for violations of the California
Department of Fair Employment and Housing statute and a provision of the
California Government Code. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. Defendants filed their answer,
demand for production of documents and request for interrogatories in March
1995. The defendants intend to vigorously defend the suit.                    49  52

the County of Orange by Gencon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Gencon against ICN
Canada Limited ICN Canada, SPI, and ICN alleging breach of contract and
related claims arising out of a manufacturing contract between Gencon and ICN
Canada. ICN and SPI were dismissed from the action in March 1993 based on SPI
agreement to guarantee any judgment against ICN Canada. Following trial in
1993, the judge granted judgment in favor of Gencon for breach of contract in
the amount of approximately $2,100,000 plus interest, costs and attorneys' fees
which sums total approximately $650,000. ICN Canada timely filed its Notice
of Appeal and Gencon filed a Notice of Cross-Appeal, seeking the award of
approximately $145,000 in additional claimed costs. Both the appeal and the
cross-appeal have been fully briefed. No date has been set for oral argument.
The defendants intend to vigorously defend this action.
On January 25, 1995, GRC International, Inc. GRC filed a motion in
the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Orange, to confirm a
$2,260,807 arbitration award issued against Biomedicals. The dispute centered
on the last payment due from Biomedicals to GRC as a result of Biomedical
acquisition of Flow General Inc. in 1989. On March 23, 1995, GRC motion to
confirm the arbitration award was granted. The Company has accounted for the
resolution of this matter as a liability assumed upon the effective date of the
Merger.
In October 1994, an action entitled Engelhardt v. ICN Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. Case No. 94-2-2322 was filed in the United States District Court for the
District of Colorado. The action was commenced by Lauri and Kenneth Engelhardt
on behalf of themselves and their infant daughter Hannah. It is alleged that
Lauri Engelhardt was exposed to VirazoleR early in her pregnancy, and that as
a result of such exposure, Hannah was born with birth defects. Plaintiffs
assert causes of action for products liability and negligence and seek
unspecified damages. The Company filed a motion on February 28, 1995 to
dismiss asserting that Plaintiffs' claims are barred by the statute of
limitations. No decision has been rendered with respect to that motion. The
Company believes that the allegations are without merit and intends to
vigorously defend this action.
On April 5, 1993, ICN and Viratek filed suit against Rafi Khan
Khan in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. The complaint alleged, among other things, that Khan violated numerous
provisions of the securities laws and breached his fiduciary duty to ICN and
Viratek by attempting to effectuate a change in control of ICN while acting as
an agent and fiduciary of ICN and Viratek, and are seeking compensatory and
punitive damages in the amount of $25,000,000. Khan has filed counterclaims on
April 12, 1993, asserting causes of action for slander, interference with
economic relations, a shareholders' derivative action for breach of fiduciary
duties, violations of the federal securities laws and tortious interference
with economic relations, and is seeking compensatory damages, interest and
exemplary damages of $29,000,000. On November 4, 1994, ICN and Viratek moved
to have a default judgment entered against Khan and to dismiss his
counterclaims. Khan submitted his opposition papers on March 15, 1995, and an
oral argument is currently scheduled for April 21, 1995.
The Company is a party to a number of other pending or threatened
lawsuits arising out of, or incident to, its ordinary course of business. In
the opinion of management, these various other pending lawsuits will not have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or operations of
the Company.
Arbitration: On June 30, 1993, ICN filed a claim in arbitration, ICN
v. Labsystems, O.Y., alleging breach of a certain supplier agreement and
requesting repudiation of such agreement. On February 6, 1995, the tribunal
awarded Labsystems approximately $5,040,000 including interest and affirming
existence of the supplier agreement between the parties requiring ICN to accept

DECEMBER 31, 1994 Product Liability Insurance
The Company could be exposed to possible claims for personal injury
resulting from allegedly defective products. While to date no material adverse
claim for personal injury resulting from allegedly defective products has been
successfully maintained against the Company, a substantial claim, if
successful, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
License Commitment
In November 1994, the Company entered into a license agreement for the
rights to develop and commercialize a group of compounds related to and
including human growth hormone releasing factor GRF, for the United States
and other major pharmaceutical markets. In connection with this agreement, the
Company is obligated to pay, upon meeting certain milestones, an aggregate
amount of $2,600,000. In addition, after such milestones are met, the Company
is obligated to pay a royalty of 9%, subject to certain adjustments, based upon
net sales of GRF in certain territories. The testing of these GRF
compounds in relieving growth retardation is in Phase III clinical trials.
Benefits Plans
The Company has a defined contribution plan that provides all U.S.
employees the opportunity to defer a portion of their compensation for payout
at a subsequent date. The Company can voluntarily make matching contributions
on behalf of participating and eligible employees. The Company expense
related to such defined contribution plan was not material in 1994, 1993 and
1992.
In connection with the Merger, the Company assumed deferred
compensation agreements with certain officers and certain key employees of the
Predecessor Companies, with benefits commencing at death or retirement. As of
December 31,1994, the present value of the deferred compensation benefits to be
paid has been accrued in the amount of $2,270,000. Interest accrues on the
outstanding balance at rates ranging from 109% to 113%. No new 
contributions are being made, however, interest continues to accrue on the 
present value of the benefits expected to be paid.
Other
Prior to the Merger, the Predecessor Companies had employment
agreements with certain executive officers. The Company assumed all such
employment agreements upon the effective date of the Merger.
Milan Panic, the Company Chairman of the Board, President and Chief
Executive Officer, is employed under a contract expiring September 1995 that
provides for, among other things, certain retirement benefits. Mr. Panic, at
his option, may provide consulting services upon his retirement for $120,000
per year for life, subject to annual cost-of-living adjustments from the base
year of 1967. Including such cost-of-living adjustments, the annual cost of
such consulting services is currently estimated to be in excess of $535,000. The
consulting fee shall not at any time exceed the annual compensation as
adjusted, paid to Mr. Panic. Upon Mr. Panic retirement, the consulting fee
shall not be subject to further cost of living adjustments.
The Company has Employment Agreements with six key executives which
contain change in control benefits. Upon a change in control of the
Company as defined in the contract, the employee shall receive severance
benefits equal to three times salary and other benefits. The executives
include Mr. Jerney, Mr. Giordani, Mr. MacDonald, Mr. Watt, Mr. Phillips and 
Mr. Sholl.                    51

8. COMMON STOCK     Prior to Merger, each of the Predecessor Companies had their own stock
option plans. Upon consummation of the Merger, New ICN assumed all options
outstanding under the existing stock option plans. The existing stock option
plans were exchanged for shares of New ICN. Each option of ICN common stock,
SPI common stock, Viratek common stock and Biomedicals common stock was
exchanged for 0512, 10, 0499 and 0197 options of New ICN common stock,
respectively.
New ICN assumed three, two and three Nonqualified Stock Option Plans
from Biomedicals, ICN and Viratek, respectively, and two employee Incentive
Stock Option Plans from each of Biomedicals, ICN and Viratek, respectively.
Prior to the Merger, SPI had three Non Qualified Stock Option Plans, one of
these Plans was reserved for certain officers of SPI, and two employee
Incentive Stock Option Plans. Under the terms of all Stock Option Plans, the
option price may not be less than the fair market value at the date of the
grant and may not have a term exceeding 10 years. The options granted are
reserved for issuance to officer, directors, key employees, scientific advisors
and consultants.                    52

Galenika sales were to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or government
sponsored entities. At December 31, 1994, there were no significant receivables
from the Yugoslavian government, however future sales of ICN Galenika could be
dependent on the ability of the Yugoslavian government to generate cash to
purchase pharmaceuticals and the continuation of its current policy to buy
products from ICN Galenika. No other customer accounts for more than 10% of

SANCTIONS     A substantial majority of ICN Galenika business is conducted in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Serbia and Montenegro. On May 30, 1992, the
United Nations Security Council UNSC adopted a resolution that imposed
economic sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and on April 17, 1993,
the UNSC adopted a resolution that imposed additional economic sanctions on the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The sanctions specifically exempt certain
medical supplies for humanitarian purposes, a portion of which are distributed
by ICN Galenika. ICN Galenika continues to apply for, and has received,
licenses under the sanctions, however, the efforts to enforce sanctions create
administrative burdens that slow the shipments of licensed raw materials to
Yugoslavia. Shipments of imported raw materials in 1994 and 1993 were 60% and
38% of pre-sanction levels, respectively. Additionally, the sanctions have
contributed to an overall deteriorating business environment in which ICN
Galenika must operate.
The sanctions provide for the freezing of bank accounts of Yugoslavian
commercial and industrial entities. The implementation of sanctions may create
a restriction on ICN Galenika corporate bond security holdings of
approximately $29,155,000 that are maintained in a bank outside of Yugoslavia.
Of this amount $8,103,000 serves as collateral for a note payable to this bank.
Management believes, however, that these funds will be available for drawdowns
on lines of credit for shipments specifically licensed under the sanctions.
As a result of continuing political and economic instability within Yugoslavia,
including the long-term impact of the sanctions, wage and price controls, and
devaluations, there may be further limits on the availability of hard and local
currency and, consequently, an adverse impact on the future operating results
of the Company.
HYPERINFLATION AND PRICE CONTROLS     Under existing Yugoslavian price controls imposed in July of 1992, ICN
Galenika can no longer continue the unrestricted practice of increasing selling
prices in anticipation of inflation. Rather, price increases must be approved
by the government prior to implementation. During 1994, ICN Galenika received
fewer price increases than in the past, a trend that is expected to continue,
applying increased pressure on gross profit margins. The imposition of price
controls along with the effect of sanctions and recurring currency devaluations
resulted in reduced sales levels in the last half of 1992 and for 1993. U.S.
dollar sales in 1994 were below 1993 levels due to exchange rate differences
despite an increase in units sold of 20%. This trend of reduced U.S. dollar
sales levels could continue as long as sanctions are in place.                    59

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1994     ICN Galenika operates in a highly inflationary environment that has,
prior to January 1994, experienced high levels of inflation along with large
and frequent devaluations. This necessitated ICN Galenika to translate the
results using daily average exchange rates. On January 24, 1994, the
Yugoslavian government enacted a Stabilization Program designed to strengthen
its currency. Under this program the official exchange rate of the dinar is
fixed at a ratio of one dinar to one Deutsche mark. The Yugoslavian government
guarantees the conversion of dinars to Deutsche marks by exercising restraint
in the amount of dinars that it prints, thereby restricting cash in circulation
to correspond to hard currency reserves in Yugoslavia. Since the inception of
this program the exchange rate of dinars to Deutsche marks has remained stable.
The trading of dinars at other than official rates has been virtually
eliminated and inflation and interest rates have declined from over 1 billion
percent a year to a current annual rate of approximately 5% since early 1994,
based on information currently available to the Company. The Company believes
that the period of time that the stabilization program has been operating
successfully is significant given that past attempts at monetary control by the
Yugoslavian government have generally been temporary. In the near term, the
positive effects of the stabilization program could reverse and a return to
prior levels of hyperinflation could occur. The success of this stabilization
program is dependent upon improvement in the Yugoslavian economy, which is in
part dependent upon the lifting of United Nations sanctions.
As a result of the stabilization program and the absence of large and
frequent devaluations, the net monetary asset position of ICN Galenika has
increased to $25,442,000 as of December 31, 1994, representing the balance
sheet increases in accounts receivable and cash from the beginning of the year.
This net monetary asset position would be subject to foreign exchange loss if a
devaluation of the dinar were to occur.
As required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP, the
Company translates ICN Galenika financial results at the dividend payment rate
established by the National Bank of Yugoslavia. To the extent that changes in
this rate lag behind the level of inflation, sales and expenses will, at times,
tend to be inflated. Future sales and expenses can substantially increase if
the timing of future devaluations falls significantly behind the level of
inflation. While the impact of sanctions, price controls, and devaluations on
future sales and net income cannot be determined with certainty, they may,
under the present political and economic environment, result in an adverse
impact in the future.
At December 31, 1994, ICN Galenika has U.S. $29,155,000 invested in
corporate bond securities with a financial institution outside of Yugoslavia.
These funds came from the initial cash investment made by the Company of
$14,453,000 and from the sale of SPI stock transferred to ICN Galenika by
ICN, also in conjunction with the acquisition. Under the terms of the
acquisition agreement, these funds were originally intended to finance business
expansion. However, in light of the current economic conditions in Yugoslavia,
these funds are used for letters of guarantee on ICN Galenika raw material
purchases and to collateralize the payment of dividends. These funds are
encumbered by a letter of guarantee for raw material purchases, of which no
amount was outstanding at December 31, 1994, and as collateral for $8,103,000
of loans, included in Notes Payable bearing interest at 67%, that were issued
to pay a 1992 dividend of $10,000,000.  Other uses of these funds in the
future, such as capital investment, additional letters of guarantee, or future
dividends are subject to review and licensing under the UNSC sanctions.
As noted above, ICN Galenika paid a $10,000,000 dividend in 1992 of
which the Company received 75% or $7,500,000. Yugoslavian law allows free
distribution of earnings whether to domestic Yugoslavian or international
investors. Under this law a dividend must be declared and paid immediately
after year end. Earnings that are not immediately paid as a dividend can not
be used for future dividends. Additionally, ICN Galenika is allowed to pay
dividends out of earnings calculated under Yugoslavian Accounting Practices
YAP, not earnings calculated under GAAP. ICN Galenika dividends are
payable in dinars which must be exchanged for dollars before the dividend is
repatriated. During high levels of inflation the dinar denominated dividend
could devalue substantially by the time the dividend is exchanged for dollars.
Future dividends from ICN Galenika will depend                    60

ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1994 heavily on future earnings and the current level of inflation at the time of
the dividend. Under GAAP, ICN Galenika had accumulated earnings, which are not
available for distributions, of approximately $71,592,000 at December 31, 1994.
However, additional repatriation of cash could be declared from contributed
capital as provided for in the original purchase agreement. In 1992, the
Company made the decision to no longer repatriate the earnings of ICN Galenika
and instead will use these earnings for local operations, plant expansion and
reduction of debt.
13. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK     Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to
concentrations of credit risk, as defined by SFAS No. 105, consist primarily of
cash deposits and marketable securities. The Company places its cash and cash
equivalents with respected financial institutions and limits the amount of
credit exposure to any one financial institution, however, in connection with
the acquisition of ICN Galenika, the cash contributed to ICN Galenika was
required, under the terms of the agreement, to be placed on deposit in a single
high credit quality financial institution outside of Yugoslavia. At December
31, 1994, ICN Galenika had corporate bond securities of $29,155,000 on deposit
with this financial institution.
14. INVESTMENT IN RUSSIA
During 1993 and 1994 the Company acquired a 41% interest in Oktyabr,
a Russian pharmaceutical company. The Company intends to increase its
ownership interest in Oktyabr to approximately 62% through a
government-sponsored investment program. Participation in this program does
not require significant expenditure of future funds. Once the Company achieves
its ownership goals it will begin a program to construct a new pharmaceutical
manufacturing facility in Russia built pursuant to good manufacturing
practices.  Although Russia may, in time, evolve into a large, free market
oriented economy, because of the present unpredictable political, social and
economic factors in Russia, the Company intends to penetrate this market in a
gradual manner. There can be no assurance as to when or if the new facility
will be constructed or as to its future success.                    61

1   The credit to other accounts is primarily due to the impact of
devaluations on the outstanding allowance for doubtful accounts. In
highly inflationary countries such as Yugoslavia, a devaluation will
result in a reduction of accounts receivable and a proportionate
reduction in the accounts receivable allowance. The reduction of
accounts receivable is recorded as a foreign currency translation loss
and the reduction of the allowance is recorded as a translation gain.
Shortly after a devaluation the level of accounts receivable will rise
as a result of subsequent price increases. In conjunction with the
rise in receivables, additions to the allowance for receivables will
be made for existing doubtful accounts. This process will repeat
itself for each devaluation that occurs during the year. The effect
of this process results in a high level of bad debt expense that does
not necessarily reflect credit risk or difficulties in collecting
receivables. For the year ended 1993, ICN Galenika recorded
provisions for doubtful accounts of $10,968,000 compared to
$48,279,000 for 1992. The timing of devaluations has a material
impact on the size of the provision for doubtful accounts. The
decrease in the 1993 provision is primarily a result of devaluations
occurring more frequently in the current year, smaller price increases
in 1993 compared to 1992, and lower levels of accounts receivable
compared to the prior year. The reduction of the accounts receivable
allowance from devaluation resulted in a translation gain of
$9,118,000 and $40,191,000 resulting in a net expense from bad debts
and bad debt translation gain of $1,850,000 and $8,088,000 for 1993
and 1992, respectively.                    62
