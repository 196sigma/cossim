To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ICN
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. a Delaware corporation and Subsidiaries at December 31,
1998 and 1997, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly,
in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,  assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.
As discussed in Notes 2 and 14, effective November 26, 1998, the Company changed
the method of accounting for ICN  Yugoslavia, a previously  consolidated
subsidiary, and reduced the carrying value of the investment to its fair
value. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1998
1.  ORGANIZATION AND BACKGROUND
ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company was formed in
November 1994, as a result of the merger of ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., SPI
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Viratek, Inc. and ICN Biomedicals, Inc. Biomedicals
collectively, the Predecessor Companies, in a transaction accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting the Merger. The Company is a
multinational pharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, distributes
and sells pharmaceutical, research, and diagnostic products and provides
radiation monitoring services.
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION:  The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its majority-owned
subsidiaries. Investments in 20% through 50% owned affiliated companies are
included under the equity method where the Company exercises significant
influence over operating and financial affairs. Investments in less than 20%
owned companies are recorded at the lower of cost or realizable value. The
accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the elimination of all
significant intercompany account balances and transactions.
Effective November 26, 1998, the Company equity ownership for ICN
Yugoslavia was effectively reduced from 75% to 35% based upon a decision by the
Yugoslavian Ministry of Economic and Property Transformation. Additionally,
representatives of the Company and ICN Yugoslavia management have been denied
access to the premises and any representation as to the management of ICN
Yugoslavia. As a result, the Company is no longer able to influence the
operating and financial affairs of ICN Yugoslavia. Accordingly, the Company has
deconsolidated the financial statements of ICN Yugoslavia as of November 26,
1998, and reduced the carrying value of its investment to the fair value,
currently estimated to be zero. The Company will account for its ongoing
investment in ICN Yugoslavia under the cost method. See Note 14.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash equivalents include repurchase agreements,
certificates of deposit, money market funds, and municipal debt securities which
have maturities of three months or less. For purposes of the consolidated
statements of cash flows, the Company considers highly-liquid investments with a
maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates fair value due to the
short-term maturity of these instruments. At December 31, 1998 and 1997, cash
equivalents totaled $77,241,000 and $194,026,000, respectively.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES: The Company classifies its investments as available
for sale. Changes in market values are reflected as unrealized gains and losses,
calculated on the specific identification method, in stockholders' equity. In
1998, upon the exchange and redemption of the Company Bio Capital Holdings
5-1/2% Swiss Franc  Exchangeable  Certificates the New  Certificates,
marketable securities previously held in trust for the payment of the New
Certificates became available to the Company and were sold, resulting in a gain
of $1,993,000. In addition, during 1996, the Company sold certain corporate bond
securities, resulting in a realized gain of $289,000.
INVENTORIES: Inventories, which include material, direct labor and factory
overhead, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on a
first-in, first-out FIFO basis.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment is stated at
cost. The Company primarily uses the straight-line method for depreciating
property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives. Buildings and
related improvements are depreciated from 7-50 years, machinery and equipment
from 3-30 years,  furniture and fixtures from 3-15 years and leasehold
improvements and capital leases are amortized over their useful lives, limited
to the life of the related lease.
The Company follows the policy of capitalizing expenditures that materially
increase the lives of the related assets and charges maintenance and repairs to
expense. Upon sale or retirement, the costs and related accumulated depreciation
or amortization are eliminated from the respective accounts and the resulting
gain or loss is included in income. 39
The Company capitalizes interest on borrowed funds during construction
periods as part of the cost of the related asset.
GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES: The difference between the purchase price and the
fair value of net assets acquired at the date of acquisition is included in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets as goodwill and intangibles. Intangible
assets also include  acquired  product rights.  Goodwill and intangibles
amortization periods range from 5 to 20 years depending upon the nature of the
business or products acquired. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying
value of goodwill and intangibles including the related amortization periods.
The Company determines whether there has been impairment by comparing the
anticipated undiscounted future operating income of the acquired entity or
product line with the carrying value of the goodwill. Based on its review, the
Company does not believe that any impairment of its goodwill and intangibles has
occurred.
As of December 31, 1998 and 1997, goodwill and intangibles included the
following                          1998      1997
in thousands
Goodwill                $   69,741  $  57,215
Acquired product rights           423,813    183,209
Other intangible assets           11,811     7,750
505,365    248,174
Accumulated amortization          41,112    21,581
$  464,253  $  226,593
NOTES PAYABLE: The Company classifies various borrowings with initial terms
of one year or less as notes payable. The weighted average interest rate on
short-term  borrowings  outstanding  at December  31, 1998 and 1997 was
approximately 8% and 18%, respectively.
REVENUE RECOGNITION: Revenues and related cost of product sales are
recorded at the time of shipment or as services are performed, provided that
collection of the revenue is reasonably assured.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: The assets and liabilities of the Company
foreign operations,  except those in highly inflationary economies,  are
translated at end of period exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated
at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. The effects of
unrealized exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency assets and
liabilities into U.S. dollars are accumulated in stockholders' equity. The
monetary assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries in highly inflationary
economies are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end of period exchange rates and
non-monetary assets and liabilities at historical exchange rates. In accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 52, FOREIGN
CURRENCY TRANSLATION, the Company has included in earnings all foreign exchange
gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions and the effects of
foreign exchange rate  fluctuations on subsidiaries  operating in highly
inflationary economies. Recorded losses from foreign exchange translation and
transactions were $80,501,000, $12,790,000, and $2,282,000 for 1998, 1997 and
1996, respectively.
INCOME TAXES: Income taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. SFAS No. 109 is an asset and liability approach
that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax consequence of events that have been recognized in the
Company financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is
established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount
expected to be realized. In estimating future tax consequences, SFAS No. 109
generally considers all expected future events other than an enactment of
changes in tax laws or rates. 40
USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME: In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued SFAS No. 130, REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, which
established standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income. The
Company has adopted SFAS No. 130 effective January 1, 1998. Comprehensive income
includes such items as foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized
holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. These amounts are
presented as a component of stockholders' equity, consistent with the Company
previous practice.  SFAS No. 130 does not affect current principles of
measurement of revenues and expenses and accordingly the adoption of SFAS No.
130 had no effect on the Company results of operations or financial position.
The balance of accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 1998
and 1997 consists of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments. None
of the components of other comprehensive income have been recorded net of any
tax provision or benefit as the Company does not expect to realize any
significant tax benefit or expense from these items.
PER SHARE INFORMATION: In 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 128, EARNINGS PER
SHARE. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. In
computing diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares
outstanding is adjusted to reflect the effect of potentially dilutive securities
including options, warrants, and convertible debt or preferred stock, and income
available to common stockholders is adjusted to reflect any changes in income or
loss that would result from the issuance of the dilutive common shares. The
Company adopted SFAS No. 128 in 1997, and earnings per share amounts for all
periods prior to 1997 were restated to comply with its requirements.
The Company Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend or
distribution of $006 per share for each fiscal quarter of 1998 including the
fourth quarter 1998 distribution declared in January 1999. During 1997, the
Company Board of Directors declared quarterly cash distributions and dividends
for each quarter, totaling $021 per share. During 1996, the Company Board of
Directors declared quarterly cash distributions for the first, second and third
quarters totaling $015 per share. For the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company
Board of Directors declared a cash distribution of $005 per share in January
1997.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: The Company has adopted the disclosure only
provisions of SFAS No. 123 for stock options issued to employees. Compensation
cost for stock-based compensation has been measured using the intrinsic value
method provided by Accounting Principles Board No. 25.
RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain prior year items have been reclassified to
conform with the current year presentation, with no effect on previously
reported net income or stockholders' equity.
3.  ACQUISITIONS
ACQUIRED PRODUCT RIGHTS - In February 1998, the Company acquired from
SmithKline Beecham plc SKB the Asian, Australian and African rights to 39
prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products. The Company received
the product rights in exchange for $45,500,000 payable in a combination of
$22,500,000 in cash and 821 shares of the Company Series D Convertible
Preferred Stock see Note 10. Effective October 1, 1998, the Company acquired
from SKB the Latin American rights to three ethical pharmaceutical products for
$3,500,000 in cash.
In November 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of the worldwide
rights except India to four products from F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. Roche.
Aggregate consideration for the products was $178,800,000, paid in a combination 41
of $89,400,00 cash and 2,883,871 shares of the Company common stock, valued at
$89,400,000 based on the initial guarantee price of $3100 per share. See Note
11.
In March 1998, the Company acquired the rights to a portfolio of 32
dermatology products from Laboratorio Pablo Cassara Cassara for $22,450,000
in cash. The Company will market the products through its subsidiary, ICN
Argentina.
The acquisitions of the product rights from SKB, Roche, and Cassara will be
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, with the purchase price
being allocated to acquired product rights included in goodwill and intangibles
and amortized on a straight-line basis over 18 years. The amortization period
was determined based upon analysis and valuations which considered the relative
profitability and growth prospects of the acquired products rights, the
distribution networks and the recognizable trade names.
VYZKUMNY USTAV ANTIBIOTIC A BIOTRANSFORMACII - In July 1998, the Company
acquired Vyzkumny Ustav Antibiotic a Biotransformacii VUAB, a pharmaceutical
manufacturing and research facility located in a suburb of Prague, Czech
Republic, for $17,942,000 in cash. VUAB produces and sells pharmaceutical
products in finished forms, principally injectable antibiotics and infusion
solutions, and pharmaceutical raw materials. The acquisition was accounted for
as a purchase and is not material to the financial position or results of
operations of the Company. Goodwill of $1,328,000 was recorded in connection
with the acquisition and is being amortized over a 20 year estimated useful
life.
OTHER ACQUISITIONS - During 1998, the Company acquired a 57% interest in
Pharmsnabsbyt, a distributor of pharmaceutical products in St. Petersburg,
Russia. Pharmsnabsbyt distributes a variety of pharmaceutical products within
Russia, including many of those produced by the Company Russian factories. The
Company also acquired a portion of the minority interests in five of its
existing Eastern European operations for an aggregate of $6,489,000 in cash. The
book value of the minority interests acquired exceeded the consideration paid by
an aggregate of $8,983,000, resulting in a reduction of the carrying value of
the related goodwill or acquired property and equipment.
The following table presents unaudited consolidated pro forma financial
information for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, as though

would have occurred had the acquisitions taken place on January 1, 1997. In
addition, the pro forma results are not intended to be a projection of the
future results and do not reflect any synergies that might be achieved from the
combined operations. 42
All acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases; operations of the
companies and businesses acquired have been included in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.
The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is
included in goodwill and intangibles and is being amortized on a straight-line
basis over 10 to 20 years based upon the nature of the business or products
acquired.
The Company has allocated the purchase price first to the identifiable
assets acquired based upon estimated fair values and the liabilities assumed
at estimated present values. A summary of the purchase price allocation of the
1998 acquisitions is as follows in thousands  Current assets excluding cash of $1,111      $   2,476

4.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In June 1996, the Company made a short-term loan to the Chairman and CEO in
the amount of $3,500,000 for certain personal obligations. During August 1996,
this amount was repaid to the Company. In connection with this transaction, the
Company guaranteed $3,600,000 of debt of the Chairman with a third party bank.
In addition to the guarantee, the Company deposited $3,600,000 with this bank as
collateral to the Chairman debt. This deposit is recorded as a long-term asset
on the consolidated balance sheet. The Chairman has provided collateral to the
Company guarantee in the form of a right to the proceeds of the exercise of
options to acquire 150,000 shares with an exercise price of $1517 and the
rights to a $4,000,000 life insurance policy provided by the Company. In the
event of any default on the debt to the bank, the Company has recourse that is
limited to the collateral described above. Both the transaction and the
sufficiency of the collateral for the guarantee were approved by the Board of
Directors. In 1997, the Company made a short-term advance of $327,000 to the
Chairman and CEO, which was repaid, with interest, in 1997.
5.  CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
The Company is exposed to concentrations of credit risk related to its cash
deposits and marketable securities. The Company places its cash and cash
equivalents with respected financial institutions and limits the amount of
credit exposure to any one financial institution. At December 31, 1998 and 1997,
the Company cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash include $109,000,000
and $178,536,000, respectively, held in time deposits, money market funds, and
municipal debt securities through seven major financial institutions.

additional capital.
The primary components of the Company net deferred tax asset at December

Net deferred tax asset               $  77,933  $  69,710
In connection with the Merger,  the Company acquired  approximately
$226,000,000 of net operating loss carryforwards NOLs. Included in the total
acquired NOLs were $191,000,000 of domestic NOLs and $35,000,000 of foreign
NOLs. Internal Revenue Service Code Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on
the availability of NOLs that can be used to reduce taxable income after certain
substantial ownership changes of a corporation. Consequently, the Company
annual limitation on utilization of the acquired domestic NOLs is approximately
$33,000,000 per year.
In 1998 and 1997, the provision for income taxes reflects a deferred tax
benefit of $8,223,000 and $35,376,000,  respectively, resulting from the
recognition of certain deferred tax assets and the reduction of the related
valuation allowance. During 1998 and 1997, the Company acquired certain product
rights from Roche and SKB and in 1998, its partner Schering-Plough received FDA
approval to market RebetronTM, for which the Company will receive royalties.
These new products and royalties are expected to generate future taxable income
that resulted in a deferred tax benefit in 1998 and 1997. 44
In 1998, the valuation allowance primarily relates to the deduction for the
write-off of the Yugoslavian subsidiary, a $12,000,000 benefit of stock options
included in the NOL carryforward, the tax credit carryforward, and certain
foreign NOLs. Upon realization, the $12,000,000 benefit of stock options
included in the NOL carryforward will be added to additional capital. Ultimate
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company generating
sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards.
Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than
not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of the
deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the
future if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are
reduced.
At December 31, 1998, the Company has domestic and foreign NOLs of
approximately $240,000,000 and $25,000,000, respectively. The Company NOLs and
tax credit carryovers begin to expire in 1999 and the capital loss carryforward
of $54,250,000 expires in 2003.
The Company effective tax rate differs from the applicable U.S. statutory
federal income tax rate due to the following                         1998     1997    1996

In Yugoslavia, the Company received the benefit of certain favorable tax
laws that resulted in income taxes at a rate lower than the 25% Yugoslavian
statutory rate. Under Yugoslavian law, taxable earnings attributed to foreign
investment are exempt from taxation for a five year period. Accordingly, 75% of
ICN Yugoslavia taxable income, the Company ownership in ICN Yugoslavia, was
exempt from taxation for the five years ending December 31, 1996. Also in
Yugoslavia, the Company received a tax credit for capital investments, which may
include short-term government bonds and property and equipment, which can only
be used in the year in which the investment is made. Effective January 1, 1997,
additional changes in the Yugoslavian tax law resulted in benefits to the
Company in the form of a reduction in taxes otherwise payable as a result of its
foreign investment in ICN Yugoslavia.
In Russia, the Company continues to benefit from special tax relief that
benefits pharmaceutical companies. Under this relief approximately 75% of the
income generated in Russia related to the manufacture and sale of prescription
medicines is exempt from taxation.  This reduces the statutory rate to
approximately 8%. The continuing tax benefits in Russia are subject to potential
changes in tax law that may be enacted in the future. Should these benefits be
repealed, income generated in Russia would require the Company to provide taxes
at the current statutory rate of 35%. In Hungary, the Company benefited from a
tax holiday which expired on December 31, 1998. 45
In 1998, ICN Yugoslavia and ICN Hungary generated tax loss carryforwards
and the Company Russian subsidiaries generated deferred income tax assets,
primarily related to bad debt reserves. Management believes that it is more
likely than not that these future tax benefits will not be realized as a result
of the seizure of ICN Yugoslavia and the Russian economic crisis affecting
Eastern Europe. Accordingly, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against
these loss carryforwards and deferred income tax assets, resulting in no tax
benefit being recorded in 1998.
The aggregate benefit using the local statutory rates in Yugoslavia,
Russia, and Hungary in 1997 and 1996 relating to the above items was
approximately $23,300,000 $033 per diluted share and $22,700,000 $038 per
diluted share, respectively.
During 1998, no U.S. income or foreign withholding taxes were provided on
the undistributed earnings of the Company foreign subsidiaries with the
exception of the Company Panamanian subsidiary, Alpha Pharmaceuticals, since
management intends to reinvest those undistributed earnings in the foreign
operations. Included in consolidated retained earnings at December 31, 1998, is
approximately $145,000,000 of accumulated earnings of foreign operations that
would be subject to U.S. income or foreign withholding taxes, if and when
repatriated.

Income available to common stockholders, for purposes of computing basic
earnings per share, reflects adjustments for cumulative preferred dividends and
an embedded dividend arising from the discounted conversion terms of the Series
B Convertible Preferred Stock. The Company Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock is not reflected in the computation of diluted earnings per share for any 46
periods, as such securities were antidilutive. Because the Company recorded a
net loss for 1998, the effects of stock options, the Series D Convertible
Preferred Stock, and other potentially dilutive securities are not included in
the computation of earnings per share as all such securities are antidilutive.
All shares of the Company Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, issued in July
1997, were converted into common stock during 1997 and the adjustment to the
number of shares outstanding represents the additional shares that would have
been outstanding had the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock been converted to
common stock at the time of issuance.

10. PREFERRED STOCK
In connection with the acquisition of rights to certain products from SKB,
the Company issued to SKB 821 shares of its Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock. Each share of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock is initially
convertible into 750 shares of the Company common stock together, the SKB 49
Shares, subject to certain antidilution adjustments, and has a liquidation
preference of $28,000 per share. Except under certain circumstances, SKB has
agreed not to sell the SKB Shares until November 4, 1999, unless the market
price of the Company common stock exceeds $5000 per common share. In
connection with the issuance of the SKB shares, the Company guaranteed SKB a
price initially at $3737 per common share, increasing at a monthly rate of
$043 per share for twenty months. The Company has agreed to pay SKB an
additional amount in cash or, under certain circumstances, in shares of common
stock to the extent proceeds received by SKB from the sale of the SKB Shares
during the guarantee period ending in December 1999 and the then market value of
the unsold SKB Shares do not provide SKB with an average value of $4600 per
common share including any dividend paid on the SKB Shares. Alternatively,
should SKB sell the SKB shares at any time during the guarantee period, the
agreement entitles the Company to any of the proceeds realized by SKB in excess
of the guarantee price. The Company has also granted SKB certain registration
rights covering the common shares issuable upon conversion of the Series D
Preferred Stock. At December 31, 1998, the aggregate guaranteed value of the SKB
Shares exceeds their market value by approximately $15,117,000, and the Company
may be required to issue approximately 705,000 additional common shares in
satisfaction of this agreement.
In October 1996, the Company issued 50,000 shares of Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock, for net proceeds of $47,392,000, in a private placement. The
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock had a liquidation preference of $1,000 per
share and was convertible at the option of the holder into common stock based on
a conversion price calculated using the average daily low for the five trading
days preceding the conversion date and applying a discount of 13%. The Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock had a 6% annual dividend that was cumulative and
payable quarterly. The Company had the option to pay the dividend in either cash
or common stock of the Company. The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock was
mandatorily convertible into common stock on the fifth anniversary of its
issuance. However, this provision was subject to extension under certain
circumstances. Dividends paid in common stock were based on the fair value of
common stock at the time of declaration. During 1997 and 1998, all of the Series
B Convertible Preferred Stock was converted into a total of 2,854,000 shares of
the Company common stock.

$20 per share on January 10, 2000. The Put Agreement also entitled the Company
to a portion of any proceeds from the sale of the Purchaser Shares in excess of
the $20 per share put price. In 1997, the Purchaser sold substantially all
shares subject to the Put Right and the Put Right expired entirely; the
$23,120,000  value of the Purchaser  Shares was added to the Company
stockholders' equity. In addition, the Company received a cash payment from the
Purchasers, which was also added to stockholders' equity.
STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN: In September and October 1998, the Company Board
of Directors authorized two stock repurchase programs. The first repurchase
program  authorized the Company to repurchase up to $10,000,000 of its
outstanding common stock. The second authorized the Company to initiate a
long-term repurchase program that allows the Company to repurchase up to
3,000,000 shares of its common stock. In executing the repurchase programs, the
Company is limited by certain covenants contained in the indentures relating to
the Company Senior Notes. In the indentures, the Company is permitted to
repurchase up to $10,000,000 of its common stock under the first program;
however, repurchases under the second program will only be permitted as the
Company generates cumulative net income, as provided for in the indentures. In
1998, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 200,000 shares of its common stock
for $4,450,000.
STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN: In connection with the Merger, the Company adopted
a Stockholder Rights Plan to protect stockholders' rights in the event of a
proposed or actual acquisition of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the
Company common stock. As part of this plan, each share of the Company common
stock carries a right to purchase one one-hundredth  1/100 of a share of
Series A Preferred Stock the Rights, par value $001 per share, of the
Company at a price of $125 per one one-hundredth of a share, subject to
adjustment, which becomes exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain
events. The Rights are subject to redemption at the option of the Board of
Directors at a price of $001 per right until the occurrence of certain events.
The Rights expire on November 1, 2004.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN: The Company has a long-term incentive plan which
provides for the issuance of shares of the Company common stock to senior
executives. Shares issued under the long-term incentive plan are restricted and
vest over a four-year period. In 1998, approximately 319,000 shares of the
Company common stock having a value of $10,466,000 were issued under this
plan. Compensation expense for the value of the common shares issued is being
recognized over the vesting period and is credited to additional capital. As of
December 31, 1998, the unamortized compensation cost related to the restricted
shares is $8,068,000. 52
CONTINGENTLY ISSUABLE SHARES: Effective October 1, 1998, the Company issued
2,883,871 shares of its common stock to Roche as part of the consideration for
the rights to four pharmaceutical products. Under the terms of the agreement
with Roche, the Company has guaranteed to Roche a per share price initially at
$3100, increasing at a rate of 6% per annum through December 31, 2000. Should
Roche sell any of the shares prior to December 31, 2000, the Company is entitled
to one-half of any proceeds realized by Roche in excess of the guaranteed price.
Should the market price of the Company common stock be below the guaranteed
price at the end of the guarantee period, the Company will be required to
satisfy the aggregate guarantee amount by payment to Roche in cash or, in
certain circumstances, in additional shares of the Company common stock. At
December 31, 1998, the aggregate guaranteed value of the shares issued to Roche
exceeds their market value by approximately $29,927,000, and the Company may be
required to issue  approximately  1,419,000  additional common shares in
satisfaction of this agreement.
OTHER: In 1997, long-term debt of the Company having an aggregate carrying
value of $124,060,000 was converted into 10,052,000 shares of the Company
common stock. In addition, the Company issued 812,000 shares of its common
stock, having a value of $10,000,000, in settlement of litigation. The Company
also issued 129,665 shares of its common stock, having a value of $1,875,000, in
payment of a portion of the 6% annual dividend on the Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock.
12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
INVESTIGATIONS: Pursuant to an Order Directing Private Investigation and
Designating Officers to Take Testimony,  entitled In the Matter of ICN
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., P-177 the Order, a private investigation is being
conducted by the United States Securities and Exchange  Commission the
Commission with respect to certain matters pertaining to the status and
disposition of the 1994 Hepatitis C NDA. As set forth in the Order, the
investigation concerns whether, during the period from June 1994 through
February 1995, the Company, persons or entities associated with it and others,
in the offer and sale or in connection with the purchase and sale of Company
securities, engaged in possible violations of Section 17a of Securities Act of
1933 the Securities Act and Section 10b of the Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934 the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, by having possibly: i
made false or misleading statements or omitted material facts with respect to
the status and disposition of the 1994 Hepatitis C NDA; ii purchased or sold
Common Stock while in possession of material, non-public information concerning
the status and disposition of the 1994 Hepatitis C NDA; or iii conveyed
material, non-public information concerning the status and disposition of the
1994 Hepatitis C NDA, to other persons who may have purchased or sold Common
Stock. The Company has cooperated and continues to cooperate with the Commission
in its investigation. On January 13, 1998, the Company received a letter from
the Commission Philadelphia District Office the District Office stating
the District Office intention to recommend to the Commission that it authorize
the institution of a civil action against the Company, Milan Panic, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and a former senior executive of the
Company. As set forth in the letter, the District Office seeks the authority to
commence a civil action to enjoin the Company from future violations of Section
10b of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and to impose a civil
penalty of up to $500,000 on the Company. In regard to Mr. Panic, the District
Office seeks the authority to commence a civil action: i to enjoin Mr. Panic
from future violations of Section 17a of the Securities Act, Section 10b of
the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5  thereunder;  ii for disgorgement of
approximately $390,000; iii for prejudgment interest; iv for a civil penalty
pursuant to Section 21A of the Exchange Act that cannot exceed three times any
amount disgorged; and v for an order barring Mr. Panic from serving as an
officer or director of a public company pursuant to Section 21 of the Exchange
Act. On January 30, 1998 and thereafter, the Company filed submissions with the
Commission urging that it reject the District Office request. On August 27,
1998, the Company counsel was informed by the District Office that i the
District Office had withdrawn its request for authorization to commence an
enforcement action against Mr. Panic with respect to allegations of illegal
insider trading and the remedies of disgorgement, interest, and monetary
penalties attendant thereto; and ii the Commission had granted the District 53
Office request for authorization to commence an enforcement action against the
Company, Mr. Panic, and a senior executive officer of the Company alleging false
or misleading statements or omissions with respect to the status and disposition
of the 1994 Hepatitis C NDA, including the remedies of injunctive relief and a
civil penalty not to exceed $500,000 against the Company, and injunctive relief
and a director and officer bar against Mr. Panic.
The Company has received subpoenas from a Grand Jury in the United States
District Court, Central District of California requesting the production of
documents covering a broad range of matters over various time periods. The
Company understands that the Company, Mr. Panic, two current senior executive
officers, a former senior officer, and a current employee of the Company are
targets of the investigation. The Company also understands that a senior
executive officer, a former officer, a current employee, and a former employee
are subjects of the investigation. The United States Attorney office has
advised counsel for the Company that the areas of its investigation include
disclosures made and not made concerning the 1994 Hepatitis C NDA to the public
and other third parties; stock sales for the benefit of Mr. Panic following
receipt on November 28, 1994 of a letter from the FDA informing the Company that
the 1994 Hepatitis C NDA had been found not approvable; possible violations of
the economic embargo imposed by the United States upon the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, based upon alleged sales by the Company and Mr. Panic of stock
belonging to Company employees; and, with respect to Mr. Panic, personal
disposition of assets of entities associated with Yugoslavia, including possible
misstatements and/or omissions in federal tax filings. The Company has and
continues to cooperate in the Grand Jury investigation. A number of current and
former employees of the Company have been interviewed by the government in
connection with the investigation. The United States Attorney office has
issued subpoenas requiring various current and former officers and employees of
the Company to testify before the Grand Jury. Certain current and former
employees testified before the Grand Jury beginning in July 1998.
On or about February 9, 1999, the Company commenced an action in the United
States District Court of the District of Columbia against the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia FRY, the Republic of Serbia and the State Health Fund of
Serbia the State Fund seeking damages in the amount of at least $500,000,000
and declaratory relief arising out of the FRY recent seizure of the Company
majority interest in ICN Yugoslavia and the failure of the State Fund to pay ICN
Yugoslavia for goods sold and delivered. On or about March 9, 1999, the State
Fund commenced an arbitration against the Company before the International
Chamber of Commerce for unquantified damages due to alleged breaches of the
agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its majority ownership interest
in ICN Yugoslavia, and for unspecified injunctive relief. The Company intends to
prosecute vigorously its claims against the FRY and any related entities, and to
defend against the State Fund claims against the Company, which the Company
believes to be meritless and filed solely as a response to the Company
earlier-filed action in the United States District Court.
The Company is party to other pending lawsuits or subject to a number of
threatened lawsuits. While the ultimate outcome of pending and threatened
lawsuits and the Commission and Grand Jury investigations cannot be predicted
with certainty, and an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect
on the Company, at this time in the opinion of management, the ultimate
resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the Company
consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE: The Company is currently self-insured with
respect to product liability claims and could be exposed to possible claims for
personal injury resulting from allegedly defective products. While to date no
material adverse claim for personal injury resulting from allegedly defective
products has been successfully maintained against the Company, a substantial
claim, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
BENEFITS PLANS: The Company has a defined contribution plan that provides
all U.S. employees the opportunity to defer a portion of their compensation for
payout at a subsequent date. The Company can voluntarily make matching
contributions on behalf of participating and eligible employees. The Company
expense related to such defined contribution plan was not material in 1998, 1997
and 1996.
In connection with the Merger, the Company assumed deferred compensation
agreements with certain officers and certain key employees of the Predecessor
Companies, with benefits commencing at death or retirement. As of December 31,
1998, the present value of the deferred compensation benefits to be paid has
been accrued in the amount of $2,868,000. Interest accrues on the outstanding
balance at rates ranging from 94% to 126%. No new contributions are being
made; however, interest continues to accrue on the present value of the benefits
expected to be paid.
54   OTHER: Milan Panic, the Company Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer, is employed under a contract expiring December 31, 2002 that provides
for, among other things, certain health and retirement benefits. The contract is
automatically extended at the end of each term for successive one year periods
unless either the Company or Mr. Panic terminates the contract upon six months
prior written notice. Mr. Panic, at his option, may provide consulting services
upon his retirement for $120,000 per year for life, subject to annual
cost-of-living adjustments from the base year of 1967, and will be entitled when
serving as a consultant to participate in the Company medical and dental
plans. Including such cost-of-living adjustments, the annual cost of such
consulting services is currently estimated to be in excess of $584,000. The
consulting fee shall not at any time exceed the annual compensation as adjusted,
paid to Mr. Panic. Upon Mr. Panic retirement, the consulting fee shall not be
subject to further cost-of-living adjustments.
The Company has employment agreements with six key executives which contain
change in control benefits. Upon a change in control of the Company as
defined in the contract, the employee shall receive severance benefits equal to
three times salary and other benefits.
13. BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA
The Company is a multinational pharmaceutical company that develops,
manufactures, distributes and sells pharmaceutical, research, and diagnostic
products and provides radiation monitoring services. The Company is organized
and operates in the Pharmaceutical group and the Biomedical group. The
Pharmaceuticals group produces and markets a variety of pharmaceutical products
worldwide and derives royalty revenues from sales of certain of its products by
a third party under a license agreement. The Biomedicals group markets research
products and related services, immunodiagnostic reagents and instrumentation,
and provides radiation monitoring services.
In 1998, the principal markets for the Company products were the United
States, Russia, and Yugoslavia, which represented approximately 23%, 20%, and
17%, respectively, of the Company revenues for the year. However, as discussed
in Note 14, effective November 26, 1998, the Company Yugoslavian operations
were seized by the Yugoslavian government. Operations in Russia are subject to
business risks described in Note 15. Approximately 77%, 82%, and 80% of the
Company revenues for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively, were generated from operations outside the United States. The
Company foreign operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting
business abroad, including possible nationalization or expropriation, price and
exchange controls, limitations on foreign participation in local enterprises,
health-care regulation, and other restrictive governmental actions.
Changes in the relative values of currencies take place from time to time
and may materially affect the Company results of operations. Their effects on
the Company future operations are not predictable. The Company does not
currently provide any hedges on its foreign currency exposure and, in certain
countries in which the Company operates, no effective hedging programs are
available. At December 31, 1998, the Company had a net monetary asset position
in Russia of approximately $13,952,000 which is subject to loss in the event
that a decline in the value of the ruble relative to the dollar were to occur. 55
In 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131, DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN
ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION, which requires reporting certain financial
information according to the management approach. This approach requires
reporting information regarding operating segments on the basis used internally
by management to evaluate segment  performance.  SFAS 131 also requires
disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major customers.
The Statement was effective December 31, 1998 and has been adopted for all
periods presented.
The Company is organized into business units on the basis of geographic
region. In applying SFAS 131, these business units have been aggregated into
eight reportable segments based on similar long-term economic characteristics.
The Company operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland comprise the
Other Eastern Europe segment.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
the Note 2. The Company evaluates segment performance based on income from
operations, which excludes intersegment sales as well as interest income and
expense and foreign  exchange gains and losses.  The Company  allocates
amortization on the product rights acquired from Roche and SKB among the
segments where the related revenues are reported; the unamortized cost of such
acquired  product  rights is included  in assets of the North  America
Pharmaceuticals segment.
The tables below present information about reported segments and geographic
data for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996 in thousands.                          REVENUES             OPERATING INCOME LOSS

Revenues are attributed to the countries based upon the country of domicile
of the Company subsidiary which made the sale, with the exception of certain
sales exported from the United States into the Asia, Africa, and Australia
region, where the sales are attributed to the region based upon the location of
the customer.  During 1997,  sales to the  Yugoslavian  government  and
government-sponsored entities represented approximately 22% of the Company
total revenues. For 1998 no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company
revenues.  Long-lived assets principally consist of property, plant, and
equipment, acquired product rights, and goodwill.
57 14. ICN YUGOSLAVIA
On February 6, 1999, the government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
acting through the Federal Ministry of Health and/or the Ministry of Health of
Serbia, seized control of the Company 75% owned subsidiary, ICN Yugoslavia.
This action, based on a decision by the Ministry for Economic and Property
Transformation that was reached on November 26, 1998, effectively reduced the
Company equity ownership of ICN Yugoslavia from 75% to 35%. The Ministry of
Economic and Property Transformation decision was based on the unilaterally
imposed recalculation of the Company original capital contribution to ICN
Yugoslavia. Subsequent to the seizure, the Commercial Court of Belgrade issued
an order stating that a change in control had occurred. These actions were
taken,  contrary to Yugoslavian  law,  without any  notification  to or
representation by the Company. Since the change of control, representatives of
the Company and ICN Yugoslavia management have been denied access to the
premises and any representation as to the management of ICN Yugoslavia. As a
result, the Company is no longer able to influence the operating and financial
affairs of ICN Yugoslavia and deconsolidated the financial statements of ICN
Yugoslavia as of November 26, 1998. Accordingly, the Company recorded a charge
of $235,290,000 in the fourth quarter of 1998, which is included in Eastern
European Charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. This
charge reduces the carrying value of the Company investment in ICN Yugoslavia
to its fair value, currently estimated to be zero.
The summary balance sheet of ICN Yugoslavia as of the effective date of the
write-off November 26, 1998 is presented below.

Prior to the seizure, ICN Yugoslavia operations were adversely affected
by the April  1998  devaluation  of the dinar,  and by the  Company
previously-announced suspension of sales to the Yugoslavian government. On April
1, 1998, the Yugoslavian government devalued the dinar from a rate of 60 dinars
per U.S. $1 to 1092 dinars per U.S. $1. At the time of the devaluation the
Company net monetary asset  position in Yugoslavia  was  approximately
$38,000,000, resulting in a foreign exchange loss of approximately $17,000,000
which was recognized in the second quarter of 1998. In addition, sales and gross
profit margins at ICN Yugoslavia were adversely affected by the exchange rate
changes and the Yugoslavian government refusal to approve price increases
sought by the Company. The Company, along with many of its competitors,
suspended all direct sales to the Yugoslavian government in an effort to
encourage the Yugoslavian government to approve price increases. The suspension
of sales to the Yugoslavian government continued through 1998.
58
Through the first quarter of 1998, the majority of ICN Yugoslavia
domestic sales were made to the Yugoslavian government or government-funded
entities. During early 1997, the Company established credit terms with the
Yugoslavian government under which future receivables were interest-bearing with
one year terms and payable in dinars, but fixed in dollar amounts. At December
31, 1997, the Company had approximately $145,431,000 of notes receivable from
the Yugoslavian government under such terms. During the first quarter of 1998,
the Company continued to make sales to the Yugoslavian  government and
government-sponsored entities under similar terms in order to reduce the
Company exposure to losses resulting from exchange rate fluctuations. In the
second and third quarters of 1998, the Yugoslavian government defaulted on its
obligations to the Company on $176,204,000 of accounts and notes receivable. As
a result of the government default and the suspension of sales to the
government, the Company recorded a $173,440,000 charge against earnings at ICN
Yugoslavia in the second quarter of 1998. The charge is included in Eastern
European Charges $165,646,000, cost of product sales $3,667,000, and
interest income $4,127,000 in the accompanying consolidated statements of
income. The charge consists of a $151,204,000 reserve for losses on notes
receivable including accrued interest, reserves of $7,757,000 for losses on
accounts receivable from government-sponsored entities, and a $14,479,000
write-down of the value of certain related investments and assets.
In March 1998, ICN Yugoslavia acquired a 337% interest in a healthcare
center in the Republic of Montenegro from the Yugoslavian government in exchange
for 147,000,000 dinars $24,400,000 of accounts receivable and approximately
$1,200,000 in cash. ICN Yugoslavia also acquired a 15% interest in the financial
institution Komercijalna Banka A.D. from the Yugoslavian government in exchange
for 28,600,000 dinars $4,700,000 of accounts receivable.
15. ICN RUSSIA
The Company Russian operations consist of five pharmaceutical factories
and related distribution operations. In addition, the Company operates 28 retail
pharmacies in Russia. The Company Russian operations generated 20% 1998, 18%
1997, and 11% 1996 of the Company total revenues.
The Company Russian operations have been adversely affected by the recent
economic events in the region. During 1998, in response to worsening liquidity
and declining currency reserves, the Russian government sought international
financial assistance and the Russian Central Bank used financial assistance from
the International Monetary Fund, along with its existing monetary reserves, in
an effort to support the value of the ruble. However, in August 1998, the
Central Bank announced that it was no longer able to support the ruble at its
then-current exchange rate of approximately 63 rubles to $1, and that it would
allow the ruble to fall as far as 95 rubles to $1. Subsequently, the ruble fell
sharply and the Russian Central Bank was unable to support the ruble, even at
the previously-announced level. Through the end of 1998, there were large
fluctuations in exchange rates for the ruble and the value of the ruble
continued to decline in relation to the dollar, at times exceeding 20 rubles to
$1. As of December 31, 1998, the exchange rate was approximately 207 rubles to
$1, a decline of more than 68% from the ruble mid-August 1998 level. As a
result of the decline in the ruble exchange rate, the Company recorded foreign
exchange losses of $53,848,000 related to its Russian operations during 1998.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK: ICN Russia operates in a highly inflationary economy
and uses the dollar as the functional currency rather than the Russian ruble.
During the three year period ended December 31, 1998, the cumulative rate of
inflation was approximately 180%. All foreign exchange gains and losses arising
from foreign currency transactions and the effects of foreign exchange rate
fluctuations are included in income. As of December 31, 1998, ICN Russia had a
net monetary asset position of approximately $13,952,000 which would be subject
to foreign exchange loss if a further decline in the value of the ruble in
relation to the United States dollar were to occur. 59
CREDIT RISK: The Company believes that the economic crisis in Russia has
adversely affected the pharmaceutical industry in the region. Many Russian
companies, including many of the Company customers, continue to experience
severe liquidity shortages as rubles are in short supply, and as Russian
companies' hard-currency assets remain frozen in Russian banks. This liquidity
crisis has diminished many Russian companies' ability to pay their debts, and is
likely to lead to a number of business failures in the region.
In 1998, as a result of the Russian economic crisis, the Company recorded a
charge of $42,289,000 among several of its operating segments, which is included
in Eastern European Charges $39,884,000 and cost of product sales $2,405,000
in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The charge consists of
reserves of $37,873,000 for losses on accounts receivable, the write-off of
certain investments of $2,011,000, and a reduction in the value of certain
inventories of $2,405,000. 16. AGREEMENT WITH SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION
On July 28, 1995, the Company entered into an Exclusive License and Supply
Agreement the License Agreement and a Stock Purchase Agreement with
Schering-Plough Corporation Schering-Plough. Under the License Agreement,
Schering-Plough licensed all oral forms of ribavirin for the treatment of
chronic  hepatitis C HCV in combination with  Schering-Plough  alpha
interferon. The License Agreement provided the Company an initial non-refundable
payment and future royalty payments to the Company from sales of ribavirin by
Schering-Plough, including certain minimum royalty rates. As part of the initial
License Agreement, the Company retained the right to co-market ribavirin
capsules in the European Union under its trademark VirazoleR. In addition,
Schering-Plough will purchase up to $42,000,000 in common stock of the Company
upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. Under the Agreement,
Schering-Plough is responsible for all clinical developments worldwide. In 1998,
the Company sold to Schering-Plough its right to co-market oral ribavirin for
the treatment of HCV in the European Union, in exchange for increased royalty
rates on sales of ribavirin worldwide.
Royalty revenues for 1998 include amounts earned from United States
commercial sales made by Schering-Plough subsequent to receipt of FDA approval,
as well as royalties on compassionate use sales outside the United States,
primarily in Western Europe. Royalty revenues for 1998 also include a one-time
payment of $16,500,000 which the Company received from Schering-Plough in
consideration for the sale to Schering-Plough of the additional marketing rights
in the European Union, in settlement of past royalties, and as reimbursement for
expenses incurred by the Company in preparation for the launch of ribavirin
capsules in the European Union.
In February 1999, Schering-Plough purchased 1,141,498 shares of the
Company common stock for $27,000,000. Although the shares are initially
unregistered, under the terms of the Agreement, Schering-Plough is entitled to
certain registration rights.
