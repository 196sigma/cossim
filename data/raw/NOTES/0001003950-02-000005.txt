Report of Independent Accountants To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Performance Technologies, Incorporated
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Performance Technologies, Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2001
and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

statements.
29       PERFORMANCE TECHNOLOGIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note A - Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The Company: Performance Technologies, Incorporated the Company was formed in
1981 under the laws of the State of Delaware and maintains its corporate offices
in Rochester, New York. The Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets
communications and networking products that enable the convergence of wireline,
wireless and next-generation Internet Protocol networks.
Segment Data, Geographic Information and Significant Customers: The Company
operates in one industry segment. Export sales to customers outside North
America represent 27%, 30% and 16% of sales for the years ended December 31,
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. For 2001, 2000 and 1999, four customers
accounted for approximately 30%, 32% and 43%, respectively, of sales, with no
single customer representing greater than 9%, 12% and 23%, respectively, of
sales.
Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Effective December
10, 1999, the Company merged with  MicroLegend  Telecom  Systems,  Inc.
MicroLegend, which has been accounted for as a pooling of interests and
accordingly all prior period consolidated financial statements have been
restated to include the combined  results  Note B. All  inter-company
transactions have been eliminated.
Foreign Currency Translation: The Canadian dollar is the functional currency of
the Company Canadian subsidiary. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations
are translated to U.S. dollars at current rates of exchange, and revenue and
expenses are translated using average rates. Gains and losses from foreign
currency translation are included as a separate component of stockholders'
equity.  Translation adjustments are not tax-effected as they relate to
investments considered permanent in nature. Foreign currency transaction gains
and losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Use of Estimates: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year-end and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
Concentration of Credit Risk: Financial instruments, which potentially expose
the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of
bank deposits, marketable securities and accounts receivable.  Marketable
securities consist of high quality, short-term interest bearing financial
instruments. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers'
financial condition and the Company maintains an allowance for uncollectable
accounts receivable based upon the expected collectability of all accounts
receivable.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The carrying amounts of the Company
financial  instruments,  including cash and cash equivalents,  marketable
securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair values at
December 31, 2001, as the maturity of these instruments are generally short
term.
Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased
with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
30 Note A - Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
continued
Marketable Securities: The Company has classified all of its marketable debt
securities as held to maturity and has accounted for these investments at
amortized cost. Marketable securities classified as held to maturity are high
credit quality securities in accordance with the Company investment policy.
Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the
first-in, first-out method. The Company provides inventory reserves for excess,
obsolete or slow moving inventory based on changes in customer demand,
technology developments or other economic factors.
Revenue Recognition: The Company adopted the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB
No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, for 2000. In doing so,
the Company did not incur any adjustments to revenue. Revenue is recognized upon
product shipment. Revenue from arrangements for software systems requiring
significant production, modification, or customization of software is recognized
over the contract period as performance milestones are fulfilled. Revenue from
consulting and other services is recognized at the time the services are
rendered. Any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon
as such losses are determined. Revenue from software maintenance contracts is
recognized ratably over the contractual period, or as the service is performed.
Property, Equipment and Improvements: Property, equipment and improvements are
stated at cost. Depreciation of equipment and improvements is provided for using
the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives   Engineering equipment and software 3-5 years
Manufacturing equipment      3-5 years
Furniture and equipment      3-5 years
Leasehold improvements       the lesser of 10 years or the lease term
Upon retirement or disposal of an asset, the asset and the related accumulated
depreciation are eliminated from the accounts with gains or losses included as a
component of Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Long-Lived Assets: The Company regularly assesses all of its long-lived assets
for impairment when events or circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may
not be recoverable, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.
Research and Development: Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred.
Advertising: Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in Selling
and marketing in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Advertising expense
amounted to $249,000,  $244,000 and $254,000 for 2001,  2000 and 1999,
respectively.
Software Development Costs: On a product-by-product basis, software development
costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility and
prior to general release of the product are capitalized and amortized commencing
after general release over their estimated remaining economic life, generally
three years, or using the ratio of current revenues to current and anticipated
revenues from such software, whichever provides greater amortization.
31 Note A - Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
continued
Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and
liability approach which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and
assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts and the tax basis of such assets and liabilities. This
method utilizes enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the
temporary differences are expected to reverse and gives immediate effect to
changes in income tax rates upon enactment. Deferred tax assets are recognized,
net of any valuation allowance, for deductible temporary differences and tax
credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax expense benefit represents the
change in net deferred tax asset and liability balances.
Earnings Per Share: Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income
available by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted earnings per share calculations reflect the assumed exercise and
conversion of dilutive employee stock options and warrants applying the treasury
stock method. Dilutive earnings per share calculations exclude the effect of
approximately 864,000, 236,000 and 85,000 options for 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively, since such options have an exercise price in excess of the average
market price value of the Company common stock.
Stock-Based Compensation: Stock-based compensation costs are deferred and
recognized over the vesting period in accordance with Accounting Principles
Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, based on
the difference, if any, between the quoted market price of the stock on the
grant date and the exercise price. Awards to non-employees are accounted for at
fair value following SFAS 123. In early 1999, a compensation charge of $715,000
was recorded to operating expenses for the issuance of stock options granted to
MicroLegend employees with an exercise price below the fair market value of its
common stock.
Note B - Business Combination
On December 10, 1999, MicroLegend Telecom Systems, Inc. was merged with and into
a subsidiary of the Company, and approximately 2,166,000 shares of the Company
common stock were issued in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of
MicroLegend.  MicroLegend  develops and markets Signaling System 7 SS7
telecommunications gateway products that provide signaling and control for
wireless, voice-over-IP and other packet applications. The merger has been
accounted for as a pooling of interests under APB Opinion No. 16, Business
Combinations. Accordingly, all prior period consolidated financial statements
presented, preceding the merger, have been restated to include the combined
results of operations, financial position and cash flows of MicroLegend as
though it had always been a part of the Company.
The following information presents certain pro forma income statement data of

in April 2002. Under the terms of the lease that expires in March 2012, the
Company agrees to pay an annual rental of $740,000 in the first year, with
predetermined adjustments for each year thereafter. For both lease agreements,
the Company is also required to pay the pro rata share of the real property
taxes and assessments, expenses and other charges associated with these
facilities. The Company has leased facilities in its other operating locations
in North America that expire between 2002 through 2005.
Future minimum lease payments for all operating leases having a remaining term
in excess of one year at December 31, 2001 are as follows:

Note I - Stockholders' Equity
On February 9, 2000, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized common shares,
from 15 million shares to 50 million shares.
During 1999 pursuant to a stock repurchase program authorized by the Board of
Directors in 1998, the Company repurchased 44,735 of its common shares at a
total cost of $932,000 under this program. On December 10, 1999, the Company
terminated this stock repurchase program. In connection with the business
combination with MicroLegend Telecom Systems, Inc., the Company retired 185,174
shares of Treasury stock acquired at an average cost of $1206 per share, or
$22 million.
In August 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to one
million shares of the Company common stock and the Company repurchased 341,800
and 658,200 of its common shares in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The total cost
of repurchasing such shares was $4,699,000 and $8,825,000 in 2001 and 2000,
respectively. This program was completed in March 2001.
In March 2001, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional
five hundred thousand shares of the Company common stock. During 2001, the
Company repurchased a total of 205,534 shares at a total cost of $2,173,000

34 The Company declared a three-for-two stock split of its common stock effected in
the form of 50% stock dividend on the outstanding shares payable to shareholders
of record as of August 26, 1999, with a distribution date of September 1, 1999.
Basic and diluted earnings per share, weighted average number of shares
outstanding and all applicable footnotes have been adjusted to reflect the
aforementioned stock split. All agreements concerning stock options and other
commitments payable in shares of the Company common stock provided for the
issuance of additional shares due to the declaration of the stock split. An
amount equal to the par value of the common shares issued was transferred from
capital in excess of par value to the common stock account.
Note J - Stock Option Plan
In 1986, the Company established the 1986 Incentive Stock Option Plan pursuant
to which the Board of Directors reserved 2,700,000 shares of common stock for
grant. On February 9, 2000, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Stock
Option Plan to increase, by 500,000 shares, the number of authorized shares that
may be issued pursuant to this Plan. On May 31, 2001, the stockholders approved
the 2001 Incentive Stock Option Plan pursuant to which 1,500,000 shares of
common stock were reserved for grant. The 2001 Incentive Stock Option Plan
replaced the 1986 plan which expired on December 31, 2001. 276,000 options
available for issuance under the 1986 plan were cancelled upon adoption of the
2001 plan. Options may be granted to any officer or employee at not less than
the fair market value at the date of grant not less than 110% of the fair
market value in the case of holders of more than 10% of the Company common
stock. Options granted under the plans generally expire five or six years from
the date of grant and generally vest over three, four or five years.
With respect to non-qualified options, the Company recognizes a tax benefit upon
exercise in an amount equal to the tax effect of the difference between the
option price and the fair market value of the common stock. Tax benefits related
to such non-qualified stock options are credited to additional paid-in capital.
The following table summarizes stock option activity under these plans                          Weighted-Average   Option
Number of Shares  Exercise Price  Price Range
Outstanding at January 1, 1999   1,009,607     $ 589    $101 - $ 975

Outstanding at December 31, 2000  1,500,531     $1091    $444 - $2875
Granted               572,950     $1385    $800 - $1450
Exercised              65,650    $ 736    $444 - $1025
Expired               189,001    $1505    $617 - $2875
Outstanding at December 31, 2001  1,818,830     $1154    $483 - $2875
At December 31, 2001, 929,086 options were exercisable and 1,427,800 options
were available for future grant under the stock option plan. During 2001 and
2000, warrants for 56,250 shares for each year, issued at fair market value in
1995, were exercised at an exercise price of $122 per share. At December 31,
2001, there are no warrants outstanding.
35 The Company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Accordingly, no compensation cost has
been recognized for the stock option plan. Had compensation cost for the stock
option plan been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for option
awards consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company net income
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts of $3,487,000, $4,570,000 and
$4,765,000, respectively. Basic earnings per share would have been reduced to
the pro forma amounts of $28, $35 and $36, respectively. Diluted earnings per
share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts of $27, $33 and $34,
respectively. The assumption regarding the annual vesting of stock options was
25% for options granted in 2001 and 33% for options granted in 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
grant using the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model with the following
weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2001, 2000 and 1999: Dividend
yield of 0%; expected volatility of 64%, 63% and 65%; risk-free interest rate of
47%, 62% and 54%; and expected lives of four years in 2001 and three years in
2000 and 1999, respectively.
Note K - Stockholder Rights Plan
On October 27, 2000, the Company Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder
Rights Plan. Under this plan, one Preferred Stock Purchase Right was distributed
as a dividend for each share of common stock held by the stockholders of record
as of the close of business of November 8, 2000. Until the occurrence of certain
events, the Rights are traded as a unit with the common stock. Each Right will
separate and entitle stockholders to buy stock upon the occurrence of certain
events generally related to the change of control of the Company as defined in
the Plan. The Rights become exercisable ten days after either 1 an Acquiring
Person acquires or commences a tender offer to acquire 15% or more of the
Company Common Stock, or 2 an Adverse Person has acquired 10% or more of
the Company common stock and the Board determines this person is likely to
cause pressure on the Company to enter into a transaction that is not in the
Company best long-term interest. All Rights not held by an Acquiring Person or
an Adverse Person become rights to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth
of one share of Preferred Stock at an initial exercise price of $110 per Right.
Each Right entitles the holder of that Right to purchase the equivalent of $220
worth of the Company common stock for $110. If after such an event the Company
merges, consolidates or engages in a similar transaction in which it does not
survive, each holder has a flip over right to buy discounted stock in the
surviving entity.
The Company may redeem the Rights for $001 each. The Rights Plan expires on
November 1, 2010 or can be modified or terminated, at the option of the Board of
Directors.

to initiate any action that would require the payment of income taxes. It is not
practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on
these undistributed earnings.

Note O - Litigation
Following the Company announcement on May 19, 2000 regarding its preliminary
results of operations for the second quarter, several class action lawsuits were
filed against the Corporation, as well as several of its officers and directors,
alleging violations of federal securities laws. The lawsuits were filed in
United States District Court for the Western District of New York and request
unspecified monetary damages. The Lead Counsel has been approved by the Court
and an Amended Complaint, dated March 19, 2001, has been filed with the Court.
On May 18, 2001, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated
complaint. On June 25, 2001, the Plaintiffs filed a memorandum of law in
opposition to the Company motion to dismiss. On July 20, 2001, the Company
filed a memorandum of law in further support of the Company motion to dismiss
the Plaintiffs' class action complaint.
Management believes that the claims contained in these actions described above
are without merit and the Company intends to defend against the claims
vigorously. In the opinion of management, resolution of this litigation is not
expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the
Company. However, depending on the amount and timing of such resolution, an
unfavorable resolution of this matter could materially affect the Company
future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. No costs have
been accrued for this possible loss contingency.
The Company is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise
in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of
any ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect
the financial position of the Company.
