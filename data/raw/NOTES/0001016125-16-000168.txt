These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended December31, 2015, in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, The Ultimate Software Group, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated February 26, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of The Ultimate Software Group, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting./s/ KPMG LLPFebruary 26, 2016Fort Lauderdale, FloridaCertified Public Accountants43THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS1.Nature of OperationsThe Ultimate Software Group, Inc. and subsidiaries Ultimate, we, us or our is a leading cloud provider of people management solutions, often referred to as human capital management HCM. Ultimate UltiPro product suite UltiPro is a comprehensive, engaging solution that has human resources HR, payroll, and benefits management at its core and includes global people management, available in twelve languages with more than 35 country-specific localizations. The solution is delivered via software-as-a-service to organizations based in the United States and Canada, including those with global workforces. UltiPro is designed to deliver the functionality businesses need to manage the complete employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement.We market our UltiPro solutions primarily to enterprise companies, which we define as companies with more than 1,500employees, including those with 10,000or more employees; mid-market companies, which we define as those having approximately 500-1,500employees; and strategic market companies, which we define as those having 100-499employees. UltiPro is marketed primarily through our enterprise, mid-market and strategic direct sales teams2.Basis of Presentation, Consolidation and the Use of EstimatesThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of Ultimate have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC.The consolidated financial statements included herein reflect all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of Ultimates management, necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, income taxes, the allowance for doubtful accounts, the valuation of deferred tax assets and long-lived assets, among others discussed below.Actual results could differ from those estimates.The consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position and operating results of Ultimate and include its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation3.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting PronouncementsCash and Cash EquivalentsAll highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less when acquired are considered cash equivalents and are comprised of interest-bearing accounts.Accounts ReceivableAccounts receivable are principally from end-users of Ultimates products. We perform credit evaluations of our customers and have recorded allowances for estimated losses. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on accounts receivable. A considerable amount of judgment is required when the realization of receivables is assessed, including assessing the probability of collection and current credit-worthiness of each customer. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in a further impairment of their ability to make payments, an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required.We charge off uncollectible amounts against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which we determine they are uncollectible.Funds Held for Customers and Customers Funds ObligationsUltimate has the right to market and distribute an independent third partys tax filing solution that Ultimate has branded UltiPro Payment Services. Ultimates UltiPro Payment Services offering provides payment services to our customers.These payment services are being sold directly by us to our customers only on a per-employee-per-month PEPM basis in conjunction with UltiPro, our core product.In connection with our UltiPro Payment Services product, we receive funds from our customers and hold such funds for purposes of paying the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of such customers.We invest a portion of our customer funds in available for sale securities in addition to our corporate funds in 51accordance with our internal investment strategies. The portfolio predominantly consists of investment grade securities with long-term ratings of AAA and AA+ and short-term ratings A-1/P-1. These funds held for customers and the corresponding customer funds obligations are included in current assets and current liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets as of December31, 2015and 2014.We have reported the cash flows for purchases of securities with funds received from UltiPro Payment Services customers in the investing activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013.We have reported the cash flows related to the funds received and paid on behalf of such customers to the applicable taxing authorities in the financing activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013.The associated PEPM fees for UltiPro Payment Services are included in recurring revenues in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013.The associated interest earned was not material for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsUltimates financial instruments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities, funds held for customers and the related obligations, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and capital lease obligations and other borrowings, approximated fair value due to their relatively short maturity as of December31, 2015and 2014.Funds Held for Customers and Corporate Investments We classify our investments in marketable securities with readily determinable fair values as  securities consist of debt and equity securities not classified as trading securities or as securities to be held to maturity.Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale securities are reported as a net amount in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity until realized.Gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities are determined using the specific identification method. Interest earned on investments from funds held for customers is included in recurring revenue and was not material in the years presented. If the fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost, Ultimate assesses whether we intend to sell the security or if it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery. If either of those two conditions are met, Ultimate would recognize a charge in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security amortized cost basis and its fair value. If we do not intend to sell a security or it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, the unrealized loss is separated into an amount representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors, which is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.Prepaid Expenses and Other Current AssetsUltimates financial statements include prepaid expenses and other current assets which include prepaid commissions on cloud sales.Prepaid expenses are amortized over the life of the asset typically within one year and commissions on cloud sales are amortized over the initial contract term typically 24-36months typically commencing on the day the customer processesits first live payroll using UltiPro also referred to as going Live, which corresponds with the related cloud revenue recognition. The portion of prepaid commissions that extends beyond one year is classified in other assets, net, in the consolidated balance sheets as of December31, 2015and 2014.Long-Lived AssetsWe evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets when indicators of impairment exist.For the year ended December31, 2015, no such events or circumstances were identified.The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the undiscounted expected future cash flows from such asset or asset group are separately identifiable and less than the assets or asset groups carrying value.In that event, a loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset.Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.For the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, we recorded no impairment of our long-lived assets.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 2to 20years. Leasehold improvements and assets under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the life of the asset or the term of the lease over periods ranging from approximately 3to 15years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred; betterments are capitalized. Upon the sale or retirement of assets, the cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized52Computer Software Development CostsWe previously capitalized software costs in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 985-20, Costs of Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Marketed. Those capitalized software costs were fully amortized as of December31, 2013. Computer software development costs related to software developed for internal use falls under the accounting guidance of ASC Topic 350-40, Intangibles Goodwill and OtherInternal Use Software, in which computer software costs are expensed as incurred during the preliminary project stage and capitalization begins in the application development stage once the capitalization criteria are met. Costs associated with post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Costs capitalized during the application development stage include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal-use software and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the internal-use computer software. In addition to capitalizing costs for software which are used by us in our general operations, for internal purposes, we also capitalize costs under ASC Topic 350-40 for certain software development projects related to our suite of products sold to our customers exclusively on a subscription basis under our software-as-a-service offering of UltiPro. Deferred RevenueDeferred revenue is primarily comprised of deferrals for recurring revenues for cloud services which are recognized over the term of the related contract as the services are performed, typically 24-36months and commencing with the related Live date; and implementation consulting services for which the services have not yet been rendered which are primarily recognized prior to the respective Live date.GuaranteesThe standard commercial terms in our sales contracts for UltiPro include an indemnification clause that indemnifies the customer against certain liabilities and damages arising from any claims of patent, copyright, or other proprietary rights of any third party. Due to the nature of the intellectual property indemnification provided to our customers, we cannot estimate the fair value, or determine the total nominal amount, of the indemnification until such time as a claim for such indemnification is made.In the event of a claim made against us under such provision, we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnification considering such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss.To date, Ultimate has not had any claims made against it under such provision and, accordingly, has not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in its consolidated financial statements.Segment InformationPublic companies are required to report selected information about operating segments in annual and interim financial reports to shareholders, as well as related disclosures about an enterprises business segments, products, services, geographic areas and major customers. Ultimate operates its business as a single segment and is comprised as a single reporting unit.Revenue RecognitionWe recognize revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements ASU 2009-13. We use the relative selling price method to allocate the total consideration to units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement. We allocate revenue in an arrangement using the estimated selling price ESP of deliverables if it does not have vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE or third-party evidence TPE of selling price.VSOE is the price charged when the same or similar product or service is sold separately.We define VSOE as a median price of recent stand-alone transactions that are priced within a narrow range.TPE is determined based on the prices charged by our competitors for a similar deliverable when sold separately.However, due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient information on competitor pricing and differences in our product offerings when compared with those of our peers, we generally are unable to reliably determine TPE.ESP is our best estimate of the selling price of an element in a transaction. If we are unable to establish selling price using either VSOE or TPE, we will use ESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration.The objective of ESP is to 53determine the price at which we would transact business if the product or service were sold by us on a stand-alone basis.Our determination of ESP involves the use of a customary discount from the list or book price for each element, with the discounted price applied within a narrow range.The customary discount is derived from historical data that has been analyzed to determine trends and patterns. We analyze the customary discount used for determining ESP on no less than an annual basis.We evaluate each deliverable in our arrangements to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting.A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value to our customers.Our products and services continue to qualify as separate units of accounting under ASU 2009-13.There are two major elements in our multiple element arrangements for the delivery of our UltiPro offering, which are recurring revenues i.e., cloud subscription revenues and services revenues mostly implementation consulting services.For multiple element arrangements, the consideration allocated to cloud subscription revenues is recognized as recurring revenues over the initial contract period, as those subscription-based services are delivered, typically commencing with the Live date of the related product. The consideration allocated to fixed fee implementation consulting services in multiple element arrangements is recognized as services revenues on a percentage of completion basis, using reasonably dependable estimates with respect to milestones achieved in relation to progression through implementation phases, by product.Single element arrangements typically consist of renewals for cloud subscriptions and implementation consulting services sold on a time and materials basis. Under these single element arrangements, cloud subscription revenues are recognized over the related renewal period, as the services are delivered, and implementation consulting services are recognized as the related time and materials services are performed.We recognize revenues when all of the following criteria are met:persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;delivery has occurred;the fees are fixed and determinable; andcollection is considered probable.If collection is not considered probable, we recognize revenues when the fees are collected. If the fees are not fixed and determinable, we recognize revenues when the fees become due from the customer. If non-standard acceptance periods or non-standard performance criteria are required, we recognize revenue when the acceptance period expires or upon the satisfaction of the acceptance/performance criteria, as applicable.The majority of services revenues are recognized over the implementation period, which is from the contract execution date until the Live date. Cloud revenues are recognized over the initial contract term, typically beginning in the month the customer goes Live. Recurring RevenuesRecurring revenues primarily consist of subscription revenues recognized from our customers' use of UltiPro after they have gone Live.i Cloud subscription revenues are principally derived from PEPM fees earned from UltiPro units that are Live. Ongoing PEPM fees are recognized as subscription revenues as the services are delivered, typically commencing when the customer goes Live.ii Effective January 1, 2015, we no longer have maintenance revenues associated with our Legacy customers. Since the time we announced that we would stop supporting our Legacy product in 2012, we successfully converted the majority of our Legacy customers to the cloud. Those customers that did not convert terminated. With UltiPro, our customers do not have the right to take possession of our software and these arrangements are considered service contracts. The selling price of multiple deliverables in cloud arrangements is derived for each element based on the guidance provided by ASU 2009-13.The multiple elements that typically exist in cloud arrangements include 1 recurring revenues from the combination of hosting services, the right to use UltiPro, and maintenance of UltiPro i.e., product enhancements, updates and customer support and 2 professional services i.e., primarily implementation consulting services54The pricing for the three elements that pertain to recurring revenues i.e., hosting services, the right to use UltiPro and maintenance of UltiPro as described above is bundled.Since these three bundled elements are components of recurring revenues in the consolidated statements of income, allocation of selling price to each of the three elements is not necessary and they are not reported separately.Selling price, which is established through VSOE, for the bundled elements, as a whole, is determined on the basis of renewal pricing, without taking into consideration potential price increases or potential changes in the number of employees of the customer in the future due to the uncertainties surrounding these potential occurrences.These bundled elements are provided on an ongoing basis, represent undelivered elements and are recognized on a monthly basis as the related services are performed, commencing once the customer goes Live.Services RevenuesServices revenues primarily include revenues from fees charged for implementation consulting services in connection with the implementation of our product solutions and, to a much lesser extent, fees for other services, including the provision of payroll-related forms, sales of time clocks and the printing of W-2 forms for certain customers, as well as certain client reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses.Our multiple element contracts contain recurring cloud revenues and implementation consulting services priced on a fixed fee basis. Time and materials implementation consulting services are sold as stand-alone sales not directly related to the basic implementation of the cloud product. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to services elements in the arrangement based on relative selling prices, using the prices established when the services are sold on a stand-alone basis.Selling price is established through ESP for fixed fee implementation consulting services that are included in our multiple element contracts.Revenues from implementation consulting services sold on a fixed-fee basis are recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method, which involves the use of estimates.Percentage of completion is measured at each reporting date based on progress made to date, using reasonably dependable estimates with respect to milestones achieved or billable hours, as applicable.Revenues from implementation consulting services, billed on a time and materials basis at an hourly rate, are recognized as these services are performed.Other services are recognized as the product is shipped or as the services are rendered, depending on the specific terms of the related arrangement.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsThe purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates. These judgments and estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital.At December31, 2015, our goodwill totaled $244 millionand our identifiable net intangible assets totaled $52 million. We assess the impairment of goodwill of our reporting unit annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit carrying value is compared to its fair value. We consider both market and discounted cash flow approaches to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The discounted cash flow approach uses expected future operating results. Failure to achieve these expected results may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of December31, 2015, and 2014. As a result of this test, we determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill for our reporting unit was required. We evaluate our amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset or group of assets. The amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. We also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, 55including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.Cost of RevenuesCost of revenues primarily consists of the costs of recurring and services revenues. Cost of recurring revenues primarily consists of costs to provide maintenance and technical support to our customers, the cost of providing periodic updates and the cost of recurring subscription revenues, including amortization of capitalized software. Cost of services revenues primarily consists of costs to provide implementation consulting services and, to a lesser degree, training to our customers, costs related to sales of payroll-related forms, time clocks and costs associated with certain client reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses.Stock-Based CompensationOur Amended and Restated 2005 Equity and Incentive Plan the Plan authorizes the grant of options to non-employee directors, officers and employees of Ultimate to purchase shares of Ultimates Common Stock.The Plan also authorizes the grant to such persons of restricted and non-restricted shares of Common Stock, stock appreciation rights, stock units and cash performance awards collectively, together with stock options, the Awards.Prior to the adoption of the Plan, options to purchase shares of Common Stock were issued under our Nonqualified Stock Option Plan the Prior Plan.Beginning in 2009, we began making grants to employees of restricted stock units in lieu of stock options.As of December31, 2015, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that were available to be issued under all Awards granted under the Plan was 535,677shares. The Plan provides broad discretion to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to create appropriate equity incentives for directors, officers and employees of Ultimate.The Plan is intended to attract and retain talented employees and align employee and stockholder interests.For purposes of calculating and accounting for stock-based compensation expense SBC in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ASC 718 for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, we measure compensation based on the closing market price of our Common Stock at the date of grant and it is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.The weighted-average forfeiture rate is based on historical data.In accordance with ASC 718, Ultimate capitalizes the portion of SBC expense attributed to research and development personnel whose labor costs are being capitalized pursuant to ASC Topic 350-40, Intangibles Goodwill and Other-Internal Use Software, related to software development. The following table summarizes SBC recognized by the Company in thousands:  For the Years Ended December 31,201520142013SBC - Statements of  - Capitalized software3,0131,7301,398SBC - Statements of stockholders'  Costs Incurred in Relation to a Construction PeriodWe have incurred rental costs associated with operating leases during the construction period.Rental costs incurred during a construction period are costs incurred for the right to control the use of a leased asset during and after construction of a leased asset.Since there is no distinction between the right to use a leased asset during the construction period and the right to use that asset after the construction period, rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period are recognized as rental expense on a straight-line basis.Income TaxesWe are subject to Federal, foreign and state corporate income taxes.We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach under which deferred income taxes are provided based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the taxes become payable56We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes.These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes.We assess the likelihood that Ultimate will be able to recover its deferred tax assets.Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of pre-tax book income, expiration of net operating losses, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, as well as current tax laws and interpretation of current tax laws, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.If recovery is not likely, we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable.The available positive evidence at December31, 2015included, among other factors, three yearsof cumulative historical pre-tax book income and a projection of future pre-tax book income and taxable income sufficient to realize all of our remaining deferred tax assets.As a result of our analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, we believe that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize all of the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015. As such, there was no valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. See Note 15 for further discussion.ASC 740, Income Taxes ASC 740, clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements.Specifically, ASC 740 prescribed a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.ASC 740 also provides guidance on the related de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting for interim periods, disclosure and transition of uncertain tax positions.Our accounting policy is to record the tax effects of a change in the opening balance of the unrecognized tax benefits including unrecognized tax benefits related to prior-period discontinued operations in current-period income loss from continuing operations. We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as components of our income tax provision. We did not have any interest and penalties accrued upon the adoption of ASC 740, and, as of December31, 2015and 2014, we did not have any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits.Reimbursable Out-Of-Pocket ExpensesReimbursable out-of-pocket expenses, which are included in services revenues and cost of services revenues in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations, were $24 million, $19 millionand $18 millionfor 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively.Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASU 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective DateASU 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Under ASU 2015-14, the new standard is effective for Ultimate on January 1, 2018. Early adoption will be permitted, but not before the original effective date of January 1, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method and have not determined the effect the standard will have on our ongoing financial reporting.In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Customer Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing ArrangementASU 2015-05, which requires that if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. Further, it requires that if a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. ASU 2015-05 will not change GAAP for a customers accounting for service contracts. In addition, ASU 2015-05 supersedes paragraph 350-40-25-16. Consequently, all software licenses within the scope of subtopic 350-40 will be accounted for consistent with other licenses of intangible assets. The new standard is effective for Ultimate on January 1, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The standard permits the use of either the prospective or retrospective method. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2015-05 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method and have not determined the effect the standard will have on our ongoing financial reporting57In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred TaxesASU 2015-17, which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a consolidated balance sheet. The new standard is effective for Ultimate on January 1, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The standard permits the use of either the prospective or retrospective method. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2015-17 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method and have not determined the effect the standard will have on our ongoing financial reporting4.Business Combinations2013 Business CombinationsWe completed twoacquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2013 that were insignificant, individually and in the aggregate, including Employtouch, Inc. the Employtouch Acquisition, a Canadian-based corporation and Accel HR, LLC the Accel HR Acquisition, a Delaware limited liability company located in Georgia.Acquisition of Employtouch, Inc.On October 1, 2013, we entered into agreements with the shareholders of Employtouch, Inc., a Canadian-based corporation, to acquire 100%of the issued and outstanding shares of Employtouch, Inc., in exchange for a combination of cash and restricted shares of Ultimate Common Stock. Employtouch Inc. is engaged in the business of developing workforce management hardware and software products. Employtouch Inc. was recorded in the books of our subsidiary, The Ultimate Software Group of Canada, Inc. The results of operations from this acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements as of the date of acquisition. We are marketing and selling the workforce management solution as UltiPro Touchbase to both customers in Canada and the United States. In October 2013, we introduced UltiPro TouchBase in connection with the Employtouch Acquisition discussed above, which provides our customers an interactive mobile time clock device that collects time punches, as well as highlights the information most critical to employees and managers via an engaging activity stream. With UltiPro TouchBase, our customers can capture employee time on a touchscreen tablet device, collecting employee-validated data for cost accounting and payroll; can leverage photos for accurate capture of employee time-entry, avoiding 'buddy punches'; and can validate transactions using PIN entry, HID, RFID, magnetic swipe or barcode. For the Employtouch Acquisition, we paid a total of $104 millionUSD in cash and a total of 17,788restricted shares of Ultimate Common Stock valued at $23 million, which are issuable in three 3 equal installments on April 1, 2014, April 1, 2015 and April 1, 2016 the Employtouch Stock Consideration. During the measurement period, we made certain post-closing adjustments related to the valuation of the stock consideration and purchase price allocation of Employtouch, which are reflected below and included in the cash flows from investing activities and non-cash investing and financing activities in the statements of cash flows.The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition in thousands:At October 1, 2013Net tangible assets$23Intangible  tax liability1,418Total purchase price$12,691We recorded the Employtouch Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting and recognized assets and liabilities assumed at their fair value as of the date of acquisition. The $54 millionof amortizable intangible assets consists of $01 millionin customer relationships, $52 millionin developed technology and $01 millionfor a covenant not-to-compete. The fair value of the customer relationships and the developed technology has been estimated using the excess earnings method, a form of the income approach, and cash flow projections. The covenant not-to-compete has been estimated using a damages calculation, which is a form of the income approach.The balance of the acquired intangibles, net of amortization, is stated separately in our consolidated balance sheet. We acquired net tangible assets of $23 thousandand incurred direct costs of $03 millionin relation to the acquisition. A deferred 58tax liability of $14 millionresulted from the Employtouch Acquisition, which was a nontaxable transaction. In accordance with GAAP, direct costs related to the acquisition were expensed as incurred. The balance of $87 millionwas recorded as goodwill. Since the Employtouch Acquisition was a stock purchase, goodwill and acquired intangibles are not deductible for tax purposes. For further discussion of acquired intangibles, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Acquisition of Accel HR, LLCOn November 15, 2013 the Accel HR Closing Date, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with Accel HR, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company located in Georgia, and certain members of Accel HR the Accel HR Agreement we acquired certain assets and liabilities in exchange for a combination of cash and restricted shares of Ultimate Common Stock the Accel HR Acquisition. The results of operations from this acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date. We are marketing and selling the comprehensive outsourcing services to both customers in Canada and the United States. As part of our mission to simplify the work lives of our customers human resources and payroll people, we introduced UltiPro Managed Services in the fourth quarter of 2013 as a result of Accel HR Acquisition. These managed services are now part of our Select Services offerings and are designed for those customers who want to outsource some components of their HR, payroll, benefits, and HCM technology management functions without sacrificing the control of, or access to, their employee data that they enjoy with our cloud solution. Unlike other outsourced payroll or Human Resources Information System HRIS services that typically take a one-size-fits-all approach, our customers can select from a variety of payroll management, HRIS, and/or benefits management services and combine them into a tailored bundle that best suits their unique needs. Accel HR provided these types of services to large and mid-market corporate customers in North America since 2004 and, since 2007 prior to its acquisition by us, Accel HR partnered exclusively with Ultimate to provide these services to their UltiPro customers.Pursuant to the terms of the Accel HR Agreement, we paid a total of $146 millionin cash and a total of 22,017restricted shares of Ultimate Common Stock, valued at $30 million, which are issuable in three 3 equal installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the Accel HR Closing Date the Accel HR Stock Consideration.

The restricted stock issuable pursuant to both the Employtouch Stock Consideration and the Accel HR Stock Consideration is subject to the passage of time and such shares will be unregistered when issued which places certain restrictions on when the shares can be freely traded on the open market. No other restrictions apply to the Common Stock issuable for both acquisitions. The fair value of the restricted stock issuable pursuant to the Employtouch Stock Consideration and the Accel HR Stock Consideration was recorded as of the respective acquisition dates since there are no contingencies related to the future stock issuances595.Funds held for Customers, Corporate Investments in Marketable Securities and Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsWe classify our investments in marketable securities with readily determinable fair values as  securities consist of debt and equity securities not classified as trading securities or as securities to be held to maturity.Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale securities are reported as a net amount in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity until realized.Gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities are determined using the specific identification method.Included in accumulated other comprehensive income was a $84 thousandnet unrealized lossand $10 thousandnet unrealized losson available-for-sale securities at December31, 2015and December31, 2014, respectively.

Those capitalized software costs were full amortized as of December31, 2013. Computer software development costs related to software developed for internal use falls under the accounting guidance of ASC Topic 350-40, Intangibles Goodwill and Other-Internal Use Software. These capitalized costs are included with property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets and purchases of property and equipment in the statements of cash flows. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, generally threeto sevenyears, commencing after the software development is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended use. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we capitalized $263 millionincluding $30 millionin non-cash stock-based compensation and $252 millionincluding $17 millionin non-cash stock-based compensation, respectively, of computer software development costs related to an internal-use development project for our UltiPro product offering the Development Project. The capitalized costs for the Development Project were primarily from direct labor costs for the 2015 year. The capitalized costs for the Development Project were from direct labor costs and third party consulting fees for the 2014 year. For 2015 and 2014, we recognized $11 millionand $07 million, respectively, of amortization costs which were associated with a particular product module, UltiPro Recruiting, of the Development Project which was ready for its intended use during the second quarter of 2014. The amortization of capitalized software is included in cost of recurring revenues. There was no amortization for the year ended December 31, 2013. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Capitalized computer software development costsand accumulated amortization of capitalized software, developed for internal use,were as follows in thousands:As of December 31,201520142013Computer software development costs$75,52949,46424,238Less: accumulated  software development costs,  Per ShareEarnings per share calculations require a dual presentation basic and diluted. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders the numerator by the weighted average number of common shares the denominator for the period. The computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to basic earnings per share, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued.The following is a reconciliation of the shares used in the computation of basic and diluted net income per share in thousands:64For the Years EndedDecember 31,201520142013Basic weighted average shares  of dilutive equity instruments 11,0871,0501,240Dilutive shares  equity instruments 11940471 Includes options to purchase shares of Common Stock and other stock-based awards outstanding. 12.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses.Goodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually. Identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon fair value at the date of acquisition and amortized over their estimated useful lives. On October 1, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Employtouch, Inc., which is engaged in the business of developing workforce management hardware and software products. On November 15, 2013, we completed the acquisition of the business of Accel HR, LLC which provides comprehensive outsourcing solutions, services and support for middle to large market organizations. Upon the closing of both acquisitions, Ultimate acquired certain amortizable intangibles for developed technology, customer relationships and non-compete arrangements.See Note 4 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the acquired intangibles.The changes in the carrying value of goodwill were as follows in thousands:As ofAs ofDecember31, 2015December 31, 2014Goodwill, December 31, 2014$25,696$26,942Adjustments 1561Translation adjustment 21,286685Goodwill, December 31, 2015$24,410$25,6961 Goodwill adjustments represent the net purchase accounting adjustments for acquisitions during the related measurement periods2 Represents the impact of the foreign currency translation of the portion of goodwill that is recorded by our Canadian subsidiary whose functional currency is also its local currency. Such goodwill is translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at period end. Adjustments related to foreign currency translation are included in other comprehensive income loss.The Companys amortizable intangible assets have estimated useful lives as follows in thousands:65As of December 31, 2015Gross Carrying AmountAccumulated AmortizationCumulative Translation Adjustment 1Net Carrying AmountWeighted Average Remaining Useful LifeDeveloped    of December 31, 2014Gross Carrying AmountAccumulated AmortizationCumulative Translation Adjustment 1Net Carrying AmountWeighted Average Remaining Useful LifeDeveloped    Represents the impact of the foreign currency translation of the portion of acquired intangible assets that is recorded by our Canadian subsidiary whose functional currency is also its local currency. Such intangible assets are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at period end. Adjustments related to foreign currency translation are included in other comprehensive income loss.Acquired intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life, generally threeto tenyears, in a manner that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed. Amortization expense for acquired intangible assets was $10 million, $11 millionand $02 millionfor the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Future amortization expense for acquired intangible assets is as follows, as of December31, 2015in thousands:  Lease ObligationsWe lease certain equipment under non-cancelable agreements, which are accounted for as capital leases and expire at various dates through 2018. Interest rates on these leases are 425%. The scheduled lease payments of the capital lease obligations are as follows as of December31, 2015in  amount representing interest362Lease obligations reflected as current $4,488 and non-current $3,665$8,15314.Other BorrowingsDuring the year ended December 31, 2012, we financed the purchase of perpetual licenses with third-party vendors totaling $53 million, payable over a three-year period. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we signed an addendum to those agreements totaling $08 million, payable over a two-year period. The remaining scheduled repayments of the other borrowings, which excludes interest, as of December 31, 2015, are as follows in  borrowings$40015.Income TaxesFor the year ended December31, 2015, the income tax provision of $204 millionwas based on book income from operations before income taxes of $431 million.For the year ended December31, 2014, the income tax provision of $96 millionwas based on book income from operations before income taxes of $543 million.For the year ended December31, 2013, the income tax provision of $176 millionwas based on a book loss from operations before income taxes of $431 million.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.The income tax provision consists of the following in thousands:For the Year Ended December 31,201520142013Current  and  taxes, netFederal9,54816,6078State and  tax  income tax provision is different from that which would be obtained by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 35%to income from continuing operations before income taxes as a result of the following in thousands:67For the Year Ended December 31,201520142013Income tax provision at statutory federal tax  and local income taxes, net of the federal   in tax rates1178051Recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits, federal benefit1,679Research credit, federal benefit3,23913,873Other, net7715999Income tax  tax assets and liabilities reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at December31, 2015, 2014and 2013were as follows in thousands:As of December 31,20152014Deferred tax assets:Net operating losses$402$59Tax credit carryforwards817127Research credit18,75815,518Deferred revenue16168Accruals not currently deductible790715Allowance for doubtful accounts338248Charitable   rent adjustment1,8911,292Gross deferred tax assets82,61060,547Less valuation allowanceDeferred tax assets$82,610$60,547Deferred tax liabilities:Property and  primarily acquired intangible assets6461,088Gross deferred tax  deferred tax assets$49,146$37,026Ultimate considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of pre-tax book income, expiration of net operating loss carryforwards, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income, ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and reversal of deferred tax liabilities in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If it is not more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets, we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable.The available positive evidence at December31, 2015included, among other factors, three yearsof cumulative historical pre-tax book income and a projection of future pre-tax book income and taxable income.As a result of our analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, we believe that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize all of the deferred tax assets as of December31, 2015. As such, there was no valuation allowance for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013.Approximately $14 millionof deferred tax liabilities were recorded against the identified intangible assets established upon the acquisition of EmployTouch during 2013. 68Management continues to apply the exception to the comprehensive recognition of deferred income taxes to the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary, Ultimate Canada.The comprehensive recognition of deferred income taxes presumes that all undistributed earnings will be transferred to the parent entity.This presumption may be overcome by the parent entity, and no income taxes would be accrued, if sufficient evidence shows that the subsidiary has invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely or that the earnings will be remitted in a tax-free liquidation.A parent entity shall have evidence of specific plans for reinvestment of undistributed earnings of a subsidiary which demonstrates that remittance of the earnings will be postponed indefinitely.These criteria required to overcome the presumption are sometimes referred to as the indefinite reversal criteria.Accordingly, deferred income taxes were not recognized on the undistributed earnings of Ultimate Canada.The deferred tax liability, net of available foreign tax credits, resulting from the cumulative undistributed earnings are not deemed material. We recorded a deferred tax asset, of $132 millionduring the third quarter of 2014, for the years 1998 through 2013, and we recorded a deferred tax asset of $23 millionduring the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 for the year 2014, as a result of a research and development credit study. We recorded a deferred tax asset of $26 millionduring the fourth quarter of 2015 for the year 2015, as a result of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 signed on December 18th, which made the research tax credit permanent retroactively from January 1, 2015.At December31, 2015, we had approximately $1507 millionof net operating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax reporting purposes available to offset future taxable income.Approximately $1497 millionwas attributable to deductions from the exercise of non-qualified employee, and non-employee director, stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards, the tax benefit of which will primarily be credited to paid-in-capital and deferred tax asset when realized.As a result, the tax benefits associated with stock based compensationare included in net operating loss carryforwards but not reflected in deferred tax assets.During 2015, we realized a tax benefit of $420 millioncomprised of a $319 millionand a $101 millioncredit to paid-in-capital and deferred tax asset, respectively.During 2014, we realized a tax benefit of $335 millioncomprised of a $275 millionand a $60 millioncredit to paid-in capital and deferred tax asset, respectively. During 2013, we realized a tax benefit of $255 millioncomprised of a $192 millionand a $63 millioncredit to paid-in capital and deferred tax asset, respectively. The carryforwards expire from 2018 through 2035 and from 2015 through 2035, for Federal and state income tax reporting purposes, respectively.Utilization of such net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as a result of cumulative ownership changes in Ultimates equity instruments due to ownership change provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and similar state provisions. The Internal Revenue Service examination of our U.S. Federal income tax return for the year ended December 31, 2010 was completed in 2013 with no change to the taxable income or income tax liability as reported.ASC 740, Income Taxes, ASC 740 requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not i.e., a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.During 2013, the Internal Revenue Service completed their examination of our U.S. Federal income tax return for the year ended December 31, 2010, which resulted in the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $19 million, which decreased our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate. As of December31, 2015, we had $50 millionof gross unrecognized tax benefits resulting from a research and development credit attributable to the 1998-2014 years as a result of the completion of the research and development activities study that if recognized would affect the annual effective tax rate. During 2015 we increased the unrecognized tax benefits by $01 millionrelated to the completion of the research credit study for 2014 and increased the unrecognized tax benefits by $09 millionrelated to the research credit study estimate for 2015, totaling $60 millionat December 31, 2015. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome of any particular uncertain tax position, management does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the estimates of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly in the next twelve months.Tax years 1998 to 2015remain subject to future examination by the tax jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax.We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as components of our income tax provision.Due to our net operating loss carryover position, we did not have any interest and penalties accrued upon the adoption of ASC 740, and, as of December31, 2015and 2014, we did not have any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits.A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013is as follows in thousands:69As of December 31,201520142013Balance at January 1,$4,950$$1,866Tax positions taken in prior periodGross increases133Gross decreasesTax positions taken in current periodGross  expirationBalance at December  Compensation and EquitySummary of PlansOur Amended and Restated 2005 Equity and Incentive Plan the Plan authorizes the grant of options Options to non-employee directors, officers and employees of Ultimate to purchase shares of Ultimate Common Stock Common Stock.The Plan also authorizes the grant to such persons of restricted and non-restricted shares of Common Stock, stock appreciation rights, stock units and cash performance awards collectively, together with the Options, the Awards.As of December31, 2015, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that were available to be issued under all Awards granted under the Plan was 535,677shares. Stock-Based CompensationThe following table sets forth the non-cash stock-based compensation expense resulting from stock-based arrangements that is recorded in our consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated in thousands:For the Years Ended December 31,201520142013Cost of recurring  of services revenues5,0174,4463,591Sales and  and  and  stock-based compensation  in computer equipment in property and equipment, net in our consolidated balance sheet and excluded from purchases of property and equipment in the statements of cash flow at December31, 2015, 2014and 2013was $30 million, $17 millionand $14 million, respectively, in non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to capitalized software which was developed for internal use during the fiscal years then ended. These amounts would have otherwise been charged to research and development expense for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013.Net cash proceeds from the exercise of Options were $47 million, $62 millionand $81 millionfor the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively.There was a $319 million, a $275 millionand a $192 millionincome tax benefit recognized in additional paid in capital from the realization of excess stock-based payment deductions during the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively.Fair ValueThe fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is equal to the closing price of our Common Stock on NASDAQ on the date of grant70We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.The weighted-average forfeiture rates for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013were based on historical data.OptionsThere were no Options granted during the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013.Options granted to officers and employees under the Plan generally have a 10-year term, vesting 25%immediately and 25%on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date.Options granted to non-employee directors under the Plan generally have a 10-year term and vest and become exercisable immediately on the grant date.Restricted Stock AwardsUnder the provisions of the Plan, Ultimate may, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee or the Board, grant restricted stock awards Restricted Stock Awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors.The shares of Common Stock issued under Restricted Stock Awards are subject to certain vesting requirements and restrictions on transfer.During the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, we granted Restricted Stock Awards for 579,320, 235,000and 191,500shares, respectively, of Common Stock to officers and employees and we granted Restricted Stock Awards for 9,910, 10,375and 18,198shares, respectively, of Common Stock to non-employee directors.Compensation expense for Restricted Stock Awards is measured based on the closing market price of our Common Stock at the date of grant and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.Holders of Restricted Stock Awards have all rights of a stockholder including the right to vote the shares and receive all dividends and other distributions paid or made with respect thereto during the vesting period.Each Restricted Stock Award granted to officers and employees vest in three equal annual installments of 33-1/3%of the number of Restricted Stock Unit Awards on the anniversary of the date of grant thereof, subject to the grantees continued employment with Ultimate or any of its subsidiaries on each such vesting date and subject further to accelerated vesting in the event of a change in control of Ultimate, death or disability, the termination of employment by Ultimate without cause. Each Restricted Stock Award granted to non-employee directors becomes vested on the fourth anniversary of the respective date of grant, subject to the grantees continued board services on each such vesting date and subject further to accelerated vesting in the event of a change in control of Ultimate, death or disability, the termination of employment by Ultimate without cause or, in the case of a non-employee director, at cessation of his board services at the end of his term.Included in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013was $563 million, $233 millionand $161 million, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation expense which includes amounts capitalized associated with an internal-use development project for Restricted Stock Awards.Restricted Stock Unit AwardsUltimate may, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, make Awards of stock units or restricted stock units under the Plan Restricted Stock Unit Awards to certain officers and employees.A Restricted Stock Unit Award is a grant of a number of hypothetical share units with respect to shares of Common Stock that are subject to vesting and transfer restrictions and conditions under a restricted stock unit award agreement.The value of each unit is equal to the fair value of one share of Common Stock on any applicable date of determination.The payment with respect to each unit under a Restricted Stock Unit Award may be made, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, i in a number of shares of our Common Stock equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units becoming vested, ii in cash, in an amount equal to the fair market value of a share of our Common Stock on the vesting date multiplied by the number of restricted stock units becoming vested on such date or iii in a combination of both.The grantee of a Restricted Stock Unit Award does not have any rights as a stockholder with respect to the shares subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award until such time as shares of Common Stock are delivered to the grantee pursuant to the terms of the related stock unit award agreement.Restricted Stock Unit Awards vest in three equal annual installments of 33-1/3%of the number of Restricted Stock Unit Awards on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant thereof, subject to the participants continued employment with Ultimate or any of its subsidiaries on each such vesting date and subject further to accelerated vesting in the event of a change in control of Ultimate, death or disability, the termination of employment by Ultimate without cause and shall be payable as described above, provided, however, that if any such anniversary is not a date on which our Common Stock is traded on NASDAQ, then the vesting date shall be the last such trading day immediately preceding such anniversary; and provided further, however, that if the Chief Financial Officer CFO of Ultimate should determine that any such anniversary falls within a period during which the participant is prohibited from trading Ultimates Common Stock under our stock trading policy, the CFO shall so advise the participant in writing and the vesting date shall be the date as of which the CFO has determined that such period has ended71There were 241,235, 207,000and 249,210Restricted Stock Unit Awards granted to employees during the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively.Non-cash stock-based compensation expense for Restricted Stock Unit Awards is measured based on the fair market value of our Common Stock on the date of grant and recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.Included in Ultimates consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013was $292 million, $229 millionand $167 million, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation expense which includes amounts capitalized associated with an internal-use development project for Restricted Stock Unit Awards.Option, Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit ActivityThe following table summarizes Option activity for the years ended December31, 2013, 2014and 2015, as follows in thousands, except per share  Average Exercise PriceWeighted Average Remaining Contractual Term in YearsAggregate Intrinsic ValueOutstanding at December 31,  or expired12331Outstanding and exercisable at December 31,  at December 31,  or expiredOutstanding and exercisable at December 31,  at December 31,  or expired11436Outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2015532$273618$89,373The aggregate intrinsic value of Options in the table above represents total pretax intrinsic value i.e., the difference between the closing price of our Common Stock on the last trading day of the reporting period and the exercise price, times the number of shares that would have been received by the Option holders had all Option holders exercised their Options on December31, 2015.The amount of the aggregate intrinsic value changes, based on the fair value of our Common Stock.Total intrinsic value of Options exercised during the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013was $287 million, $446 millionand $426 million, respectively.There were no Options vested during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

Based on that evaluation, Ultimates management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that, as of December31, 2015, Ultimates disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in Ultimates Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Ultimates disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the achievement of these objectives.It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and thus has inherent limitations.Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance as to the achievement of their objectives.Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act.Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP.Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015.In making this assessment, our management used the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.Based on the results of this assessment, our management has concluded that, as of December31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.However, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and, even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on Ultimates internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015, which is included below on this Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere have been no changes during the fourth quarter of 2015in Ultimates internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Ultimates internal control over financial reporting76Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and StockholdersThe Ultimate Software Group, Inc.:We have audited The Ultimate Software Group, Inc.s the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established inInternal Control - Integrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013issued by COSO.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, and our report dated February 26, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements./s/ KPMG LLPFebruary 26, 2016Fort Lauderdale, FloridaCertified Public Accountants77Item 1.Business2Item! 1A.Risk Factors13Item 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments21Item 2.Properties21Item 3.Legal Proceedings22Item! 4.Mine Safety Disclosures22PART IIItem 5.Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate GovernanceThe executive officers Messrs.
