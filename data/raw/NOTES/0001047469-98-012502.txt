18 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES General
Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. the Company is an internationally
recognized credit rating agency that provides ratings and research on corporate,
structured and sovereign financings as well as insurance claims paying ability.
The Company has offices in Chicago, New York, London and Hong Kong and operates
with international partners in North America, South America, Asia, Europe and
Africa.
On October 31, 1994, the spin-off of the Company from its former parent
company, Phoenix Duff & Phelps Corporation, formerly Duff & Phelps Corporation
D, was finalized. The Company shares, held by D, were distributed
October 31, 1994, to D shareholders of record October 26, 1994, as a tax-free
distribution for which a favorable tax ruling was obtained from the Internal
Revenue Service. D shareholders received one of the Company shares for every
three shares held of D common stock, and cash payments were made in lieu of
fractional shares. The distribution resulted in the Company operating as a free
standing entity whose common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock
Exchange under the ticker symbol DCR.
Basis of Presentation
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with GAAP and include those assets, liabilities, 
revenues and expenses directly attributable to the Company operations in 
the years presented. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior 
year financial statements to conform with the 1997 presentation.
Principles of Consolidation
During July 1994, the Company organized a U.S. subsidiary, Duff & Phelps
Credit Rating Co. of Europe, with an office located in London, England. In July
1996, the Company organized a U.S. subsidiary, Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.
of Asia, with an office in Hong Kong. The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Duff &
Phelps Credit Rating Co. of Europe and Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. of Asia.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of
shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding at December 31
for each of the years presented. Common stock equivalents are based on
outstanding stock options under a non-qualified stock option plan. Recently the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 128 SFAS 128 which changes the computation and the disclosure
of earnings per share EPS data. SFAS 128 replaces the presentation of
primary EPS wtih basic EPS. Under SFAS 128 diluted EPS, the dilutive
effect of outstanding share options is computed similarly to primary EPS as
historically calculated by the Company.
19     Following is a reconciliation of the denominator used to calculate
basic earnings per share to the denominator used to calculate diluted earnings
per share under SFAS No. 128 for the years indicated in thousands                             1997     1996     1995
- 
Basic Weighted Average Shares Outstanding.  4,986    5,416    5,619
Stock Options   1,179    1,085    1,100
Reduction in Shares for Treasury Stock Proceeds.  835    655    766
Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding.  5,330    5,846    5,953
-  Revenue Recognition
Rating revenues are typically recognized when services rendered for
credit ratings are complete, generally when billed. Revenues are dependent, in
large part, on levels of debt issuance. The Company fee schedule depends on
the type and amount of securities rated and the complexity of securities issued.
Research revenues are billed in advance and amortized over the subscription
period.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill and intangible assets are shown net of accumulated
amortization. Goodwill is amortized over its estimated remaining life of
approximately 30 years, and intangible assets are amortized over remaining lives
of 2 through 11 years. 
The Company periodically evaluates whether significant events have 
occurred which may require a revision of the estimated useful life of 
goodwill and intangible assets or an impairment of the recoverability of 
remaining balances. The Company uses an estimate of future net earnings over 
the remaining useful life of goodwill and intangible assets to measure 
recoverability. At December 31, 1997, the Company believes that the full 
amount of goodwill and intangible assets is recoverable.
Depreciation
Office furniture and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
remaining lives of the assets, typically 3 to 10 years. Leasehold 
improvements are amortized over the remaining lives of the related leases, on 
average from 2 to 10 years.
2    RELATED PARTIES Service Fees Paid to D
Support agreements in effect between the Company and D include a name
use fee of $20 million per year and actual charges for D administrative
services, which are included in the Company financial results for the years
presented. Effective September 30, 2000, the name use fee reduces to $10,000 per
year.
Service Fees Paid to the Company
The Company and D are party to service and support agreements under
which the Company provides D with fixed income research services for an annual
fee of $09 million and publication printing services for a fee which represents
actual expenses incurred by the Company on behalf of D For the years
presented, the fixed income research fees are included in revenue and the
publication printing 
20 support fees offset other operating expenses. The fixed income research 
agreement expires on September 30, 2000.
3    OTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS     The Company other long-term investments are composed of investments
made in international rating agency partnerships in Argentina, Chile, Colombia,
India, Italy, Singapore, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, South Africa, Turkey and
Venezuela.
The Company accounts for its joint venture investments under either the
cost or equity method as dictated by ownership interest.
4    LONG-TERM DEBT     The Company had long-term debt obligations of $70 million and $55
million at weighted average interest rates of approximately 64 percent and 63
percent on December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
The $70 million outstanding at December 31, 1997, under the Company
$200 million, revolving credit facility, is due on December 31, 1999.
The credit agreement contains financial covenants which require that
the Company maintain certain ratios and satisfy certain financial tests,
including restrictions on the ability to incur indebtedness and limitations on
the amount of capital expenditures, common stock dividends and advances to
subsidiaries. The Company was in compliance with such covenants for all years
presented.
5    LITIGATION MATTERS     During 1993, several legal actions were filed against the Company in
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by holders of
secured promissory notes Notes of Towers Financial Corporation Towers
and holders of bonds Bonds issued by subsidiaries of Towers in five
structured financing transactions. Towers collapsed in 1993 amid allegations of
massive fraud and is in bankruptcy. The Company had rated the Bonds but had not
rated the Notes. It was alleged that $245 million of Notes were sold that are
worthless and that $200 million of Bonds were sold that have lost much or all of
their value. Directors and officers of Towers, lawyers, accountants,
broker-dealers and the indenture trustee for the Bonds were also named as
defendants in one or more of the actions. The plaintiffs in the actions
contended that the Company and the other defendants were liable for losses the
plaintiffs have suffered and for punitive damages. The holders of the Bonds also
sought recovery from the Company of treble damages under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act RICO. It was asserted that the
Company, in its ratings and its monitoring of the transactions after ratings
were issued, was either fraudulent or negligent in failing to discover the
alleged fraud of Towers and its officers or in taking other action that
allegedly induced purchases of the Bonds and the Notes. The Company denied these
assertions. The Company ratings were based upon and assumed the accuracy of
the information provided to it by Towers and its officers. The Company took the
position that it could not be expected to detect fraud or discover variances
from the structure of a rated security when the information provided to it
demonstrates compliance with that structure. In 1996, the legal actions filed by
the holders of the Notes were dismissed by the federal courts and the RICO claim
of the holders of the Bonds was dismissed. In September 1997, the holders of the
Bonds and the Company resolved their disputes, and the legal actions filed by
the holders of the Bonds were dismissed by the federal courts. See Management
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition for the
year ended December 31, 1997.
21     The Company is involved in other litigation, which in the opinion of
management would not have a material adverse effect on the Company financial
position or results of operations.

23     The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in
accounting for the Plan. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been
recognized for its stock-based compensation plan. Had compensation cost for the
Company stock option plan been determined based upon the average fair value at
the grant date for awards under the Plan consistent with the methodology
prescribed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company net income and earnings
per share for both basic and diluted would have been reduced by approximately
$275,211 or $05 per share in 1997, $224,000 or $04 per share in 1996 and
$83,000 or $01 per share for 1995. The average fair value of the options
granted in 1997 is estimated at $1816 on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend
yield 28 percent; volatility 2485 percent; risk-free interest rate of 562
percent; assumed forfeiture of 5 percent per year and an expected life of 10
years. The average fair value of the options granted in 1996 is estimated at
$1019 on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following assumptions: dividend yield 45 percent; volatility 1825 percent;
risk-free interest rate of 626 percent; assumed forfeiture of 5 percent per
year and an expected life of 10 years. The average fair value of the options
granted during 1995 is estimated as $614 on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend
yield of 45 percent; volatility of 2095 percent; risk-free interest rate of
575 percent; assumed forfeiture rate of 5 percent per year and an expected life
of 10 years.
