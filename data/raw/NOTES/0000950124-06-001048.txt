data 1.Organization
and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
Operations Covansys Corporation and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries the Company provide information technology IT
services worldwide to large and mid-size organizations. The
Company offers its clients a focused range of IT services
specializing in industry-specific solutions, strategic
outsourcing and integration services. The Companys range
of experience runs from advising clients on IT business strategy
and strategic technology plans to developing and implementing
appropriate IT applications solutions.   
Principles of Consolidation and
Organization The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and all of its majority-owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.   
Foreign Currency For significant foreign operations, the local
currencies have been designated as the functional currencies.
The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated
into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at year end for
assets and liabilities and at the average exchange rate during
the year for revenue and expenses. The resulting foreign
currency translation adjustment is reflected as a separate
component of shareholders equity. Transaction gains and losses, which were not
significant in the years presented, are reflected in the
consolidated statements of operations in other income, net.   
Comprehensive Income Accumulated other comprehensive income loss is
primarily comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments.   
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include investments
which have original maturities of 90 days or less at the time of
their purchase.   
Short Term Investments Short term investments consist substantially of
mutual funds and also at December31, 2004 government
issued securities. The Company classifies such securities as
available-for-sale. Securities classified as available-for-sale
are required to be reported at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses, net of taxes, excluded from earnings and shown
separately as a component of other comprehensive income within
shareholders equity. The unrealized gains and losses on these
investments included in accumulated other comprehensive income
for December31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows

Financial Instruments The fair values and carrying amounts of the
Companys financial instruments and short term investments
are approximately equivalent due to the short term nature of the
instruments.   
Investments The Company accounts for certain investments in
equity instruments on the cost method. The Company continually
evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that
indicate a decline in the market value of the investments is
judged to be other than temporary. When factors indicate that
the decline in market value is other than temporary, the cost
basis is written down to fair market value. During 2004, the
Company fully reserved for its investment in JPSystems.
The impairment loss of $1,000 before tax is included in selling,
general and administrative expenses in the income statement and
is included in the other category for segment reporting. The following table summarizes the Companys
investments which are carried at cost as of December31,
2005 and 2004

Covansys ownership percentage is
less than 5% in this privately held entity. The Company accounts
for distributions from this investment as a return of capital.   
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price
over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets related
to businesses acquired. The Company continually evaluates
whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the
recorded amount of goodwill may warrant revision or that the
remaining balance may not be recoverable. The Company tests for
impairment of its reporting units by comparing fair value to
carrying value. Fair value is determined using a discounted cash
flow methodology. The results of the Companys annual
impairment analysis concluded that no impairment existed at
December31, 2005.   
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the expected life of the asset or term of the
lease, whichever is shorter. Renewal periods of leases have been
included in the lease term if the renewals are reasonably
assured. Internally developed computer software is
recorded at cost and includes purchased, internally developed
and externally developed software to be used in the
Companys operations.   
Long-Lived Assets We evaluate the recoverability of long-lived
assets excluding goodwill in accordance with SFAS144
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amounts may be impaired. The impairment evaluation is
performed by comparing their carrying values to the undiscounted
cash flows expected to be derived from such long-lived assets.
If such evaluation indicated an impairment, we use 31 Table of Contents COVANSYS CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Dollars in thousands, except per share
data discounted cash flows to measure fair value in
determining the amount of the long-lived assets that should be
written-off.   
Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with Staff
Accounting Bulletin No104, for our time-and-materials and
fixed price outsourcing contracts. For those service contracts
which are billed on a time and materials basis, we recognize
revenues as the services are performed. In our time and
materials contracts our effort, measured by our time incurred,
represents the contractual milestones or output measure which is
the contractual earnings pattern. For our fixed price IT
outsourcing, maintenance and transaction processing contracts,
we recognize revenue ratably over the applicable period as the
services are performed continuously over the contract period. For our contracts to design, develop or modify
complex information systems based upon the clients
specifications, we recognize revenue on a percentage of
completion basis in accordance with Statement of Position 81-1.
The percentage of completion is determined by relating the
actual cost of labor performed to date to the estimated total
cost of labor for each contract. This method is followed where
reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and cost can be made.
Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously
monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues
and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses.
Such revisions, which may result in increases or decreases to
revenue and income, are reflected in the financial statements in
the period in which they are first identified. If the estimate
indicates a loss on a particular contract, a provision is made
for the entire estimated loss without reference to the
percentage of completion See Note4. Covansys periodically enters into contracts that
include multiple-element arrangements, which may include any
combination of services, software, support/maintenance, and the
re-sale of hardware or software. Contracts entered into after
June30, 2003 containing multiple elements or deliverables
are segmented into separate units of accounting where the
separate elements represent separate earnings processes in
accordance with EITF00-21. Revenues are allocated among the elements based
on the relative fair values of the elements and are recognized
in accordance with our policies for the separate elements
unless, as required by Staff Accounting Bulletin No104,
the undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of
the delivered elements. In circumstances where an undelivered
element is essential to the functionality of the delivered
element, no revenue is recognized for the delivered element
until the undelivered element is delivered. Retainages are included in revenue earned in
excess of billings in the accompanying condensed consolidated
balance sheets. Revenue earned in excess of billings is
primarily comprised of revenue recognized on certain contracts
in excess of contractual billings on such contracts.   
Computer Software We perform research to develop software for
various business applications. The costs of such research are
charged to expense when incurred. When the technological
feasibility of the product is established, subsequent costs are
capitalized in accordance with SFAS86 Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed.
Capitalized software costs are amortized on a product-by-product
basis. Amortization is recorded on the straight-line method over
the estimated economic life of the product, generally five
years, commencing when such product is available. The
establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing
assessment of the recoverability of these costs requires
considerable judgment by management with respect to certain
external factors including, but not limited to, anticipated
future gross product revenue, estimated economic product lives
and changes in software and hardware technology. These
assumptions are reevaluated and 32 Table of Contents COVANSYS CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Dollars in thousands, except per share
data adjusted as necessary at the end of the
accounting period. Management reviews the valuation and
amortization of capitalized development costs. We periodically
consider the value of future cash flows attributable to the
capitalized development costs in evaluating potential impairment
of the asset. Based on these analyses and evaluations, the
Company has identified and recorded an impairment loss of $52
and $225 for its Claims Connect software product in 2005 and
2004, respectively. As of December31, 2005 the
Companys investment in its Claims Connect software has
been written down to zero. Amounts charged to expense for
research and development of computer software were not material
for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Amounts capitalized were $83, $208 and $909 for
the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The amortization of software development costs
was $1,549, $1,707 and $2,437 for the years ended
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accumulated amortization on computer software
amounted to $10,689 and $8,892 as of December31, 2005 and
2004, respectively.   
Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of
a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date.   
Other Income, Net Other income, net, represents the gain on sale of
the development center Note20, interest earned and
realized gains and losses on cash and short term investments
determined on a specific identification basis, loss from sale of
investment carried at cost and foreign currency gains/losses.   
Net Income Loss Per Share Basic and diluted net income loss per share is
computed in accordance with SFAS No128, Earnings
Per Share, as amended by Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF Issue03-6 by dividing net income loss
available for common shareholders by the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding. The calculation of
dilutive net income loss per share excludes the following
common stock equivalents for the respective periods because
their impact was anti-dilutive.

beginning after March31, 2004. The Company adopted
Issue03-6 in the second quarter ended June30, 2004
and restated EPS for all prior periods presented. The adoption
of Issue03-6 results in a reduction in EPS available for
common shareholders in periods where the Company has income and
has no impact in periods where the Company has a loss. The
Companys SeriesA Voting Convertible Preferred Stock
was redeemed as part of the Recapitalization Agreement with the

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of
Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions which, in the opinion
of management, are significant to the underlying amounts
included in the financial statements and for which it would be
reasonably possible that future events or information could
change those estimates include: 1revenue recognition
under the percentage-of-completion method, 2impairment
assessments of goodwill and other long-lived assets,
3realization of deferred tax assets and assessment of
tax reserves recorded, 4allowance for doubtful accounts
and 5litigation-related contingencies. These estimates
are discussed further throughout the accompanying notes to the
consolidated financial statements. The Company has formal
variable compensation plans for sales, delivery and management
employees. These plans are structured to pay out quarterly,
semi-annually or annually depending on the plan. Amounts are
accrued on a monthly basis relative to actual performance
compared to performance targets.   
Stock Options The Company has elected to account for stock
options using the intrinsic value method prescribed in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related interpretations. As supplemental information, the
Company has elected to provide the pro forma disclosures, as
permitted under the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No123.
Accordingly, no compensation expense other than expense required
for changes to stock option grants has been recognized for the
Plan within the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations. Had compensation expense for the Plan been
determined based on the fair value at the grant date consistent

During 2004, the Company made amendments to the
stock option grants of two employees upon their termination. In
connection with the amendments, the Company recorded a charge of
$243. Recently Issued Financial Accounting
Standards In December 2004 the FASB issued SFAS
No123R, Share-Based Payment, that requires
companies to expense the value of employee stock options and
similar awards. The effective date for application by public
companies is annual periods beginning after June15, 2005.
FAS123R applies to all outstanding and unvested
share-based payment awards at a Companys adoption date.
The Company is required to adopt the provisions of FAS123R
effective January1, 2006 and intends to use the modified
prospective method. Under this method, awards that are granted,
modified or settled after the date of adoption or have not fully
vested at the date of adoption will be measured and accounted
for under FAS123R. The Company estimates that the adoption
of FAS123R will reduce 2006 operating results before taxes
by approximately $1,700. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position FSP109-2 Accounting and Disclosure
Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which provides
accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings
repatriation provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004. The Act provides special one-time dividends received
deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a
U.S. taxpayer. FSP FASB109-2 provides for a period of time
beyond the financial reporting period of enactment for a company
to evaluate the effect of the Act on its plan for reinvestment
or repatriation of foreign earnings. The Company did not avail
itself to the one-time repatriation opportunities provided by
the Act. In May 2005, the FASB issued FAS154,
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a
replacement of APBOpinion No20 and
FASBStatement No3. Previously,
APBNo20, Accounting Changes and
SFASNo3, Reporting Accounting Changes in
Interim Financial Statements required the inclusion of the
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle in net
income of the period of the change. FAS154 35 Table of Contents COVANSYS CORPORATION AND

change arises after the effective date.

Each right, if exercisable, will entitle its
holder to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of the
Companys SeriesB Junior Participating Preferred
Stock at an exercise price of $1100, subject to adjustment. If a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person,
each holder of a Right will thereafter have the right to
receive, upon exercise, Common Shares or, in certain
circumstances, Preferred Shares or other similar securities of
the Company having a value equal to two times the exercise
price of the Right. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing,
following the existence of a Acquiring Person, all Rights that
are, or under certain circumstances specified in the Rights
Agreement were, beneficially owned by any Acquiring Person will
be null and void. In the event that the Company is acquired in a
merger or other business combination transaction or 50% or more
of its consolidated assets or earning power are sold after a
person or group has become an Acquiring Person, proper provision
will be made so that each holder of a Right will thereafter have
the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at the then
current exercise price of the Right, that number of shares of
common stock of the acquiring company which at the time of such
transaction will have a market value of two times the exercise
price of the Right. In the event that any person or group
becomes an Acquiring Person, proper provision shall be made so
that each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially
owned by the Acquiring Person which will thereafter be void,
will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise that
number of Common Shares having a market value of two times the
exercise price of the Right. At any time after any person or group becomes an
Acquiring Person and prior to the acquisition by such person or
group of 50% or more of the outstanding Common Shares, the Board
of Directors of the Company may exchange the Rights other than
Rights owned by such person or group which will have become
void, in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one Common
Share, or one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share or of a share
of a class or series of the Companys preferred stock
having equivalent rights, preferences and privileges, per Right
subject to adjustment. The board of directors may redeem the Rights at
any time before they become exercisable for $01per Right

Fixed Price Contracts The Company realized approximately 42% of its
revenue during the year ended December31, 2005, from fixed
price contracts percentage of completion as well as fixed price
IT outsourcing and maintenance. 37 Table of Contents COVANSYS CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Dollars in thousands, except per share
data Approximately 14% of our revenue during the year
ended December31, 2005 was realized from fixed price
contracts with respect to which we recognize revenue on a
percentage of completion basis. These contracts expose the
Company to collection risk on both billed and unbilled
receivables in the event that contract milestones are not met or
the client does not accept the product as delivered. In
addition, the Company could incur unanticipated losses if it is
necessary to increase its estimated cost to complete. The Companys 2004 financial results were
negatively impacted by approximately $11,192 due to four
significant fixed price contracts which it considers to be
challenged. Communications with contracting parties during
2004 caused management to re-assess the collectibility of billed
and unbilled receivables for two troubled projects. In both
cases, the Company was informed that its services would no
longer be required to complete the project prior to its
implementation. As of December31, 2004, the Company was
not performing work on either of these contracts. As a result,
the Company reduced the related receivables by $5,500 and $350
to their net realizable value in the first quarter and third
quarter of 2004, respectively. In accordance with the
application of percentage of completion accounting, the Company
reflected the changes as a contract price adjustment, and
accordingly, as a reduction in revenue. In the fourth quarter of
2004, the Company reached a settlement with one of these
customers, resulting in the recovery of $350 of the previously
written-off receivable. This recovery was reflected as revenue
in the fourth quarter. The Company also determined it was necessary to
increase its estimated cost to complete for three of these
projects due to changes in 2004 in both scope and resource
requirements. The revision in estimates had the effect of
reducing gross margin by $5,700 in 2004. At December31, 2005, the Company has $2,226
in billed and unbilled receivables related to a challenged
contract for which the Company is still performing services and
which management believes are collectible. Subsequent to December31, 2005, the Company
received a notification from two of its Public Sector customers
that they were terminating their contracts with the Company
prior to the completion of all of the deliverables under the
contracts. At December31, 2005 the Company has recorded
receivables and revenue in excess of $2,200 related to these
customers. The Company and the customers are currently in
negotiations concerning the resolution of these outstanding
receivables and the Company has recorded no reserves for such
amounts, if any, which may not be paid.   
5.
Common Stock Repurchase Program The Companys board of directors has
authorized the repurchase of up to 14,000,000shares of the
Companys common stock. During the years ended
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company repurchased
415,700shares, 253,100shares and 557,200shares
for cash, at a total cost of $4,803, $2,408 and $1,485,
respectively. Through December31, 2005, the Company has
repurchased 11,838,176shares of its common stock for cash
in the open market, at a total cost of $146,783. As of
December31, 2005, 2,161,824shares remain available
for repurchase under the board of directors authorization. The
Company has entered into a Credit Agreement which restricts the
Companys ability to repurchase shares of its common stock
in the event that a default exists under the Credit Agreement or
in the event there are borrowings outstanding under the Credit
Agreement.

outstanding common shares of Fortune Infotech Limited. In
December 2005 Covansys India Limited acquired an additional 20%

The Company tested for impairment of its
reporting units by comparing estimated fair value to carrying
value. Fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow
methodology. The Company performed this analysis as part of its
annual assessment as of December31, 2005 and 2004. These
evaluations indicated that goodwill was not impaired. The
Companys goodwill is not deductible for income tax
purposes. 39 Table of Contents COVANSYS CORPORATION AND

India. The Company also has operations in Canada and throughout
Europe. Covansys India is an Indian corporation subject to
income taxes and receives certain exemptions from Indian income
taxes under free trade zone and software exporters provisions of
Indian tax law. The Company considers all undistributed earnings
of its foreign subsidiaries, which the Company estimates could
be as much as $77,700, to be permanently invested. Therefore, no

Realization of deferred tax assets associated
with the Companys future deductible temporary differences
and net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon
generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration.
Although realization of the deferred tax assets is not assured,
management believes it is more likely than not that the net
deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable
income. The Company utilized domestic net operating loss
carryforwards during 2005 and 2004. The effective tax rate was
233% for the full year 2005. On a quarterly basis, management
assesses whether it remains more likely than not that the net
deferred tax assets will be realized. The valuation allowance
recorded relates to state net operating losses that begin to
expire in 2005. During 2005, the Company reversed $539 of
valuation reserves related to state net operating losses and
wrote off $335 in deferred tax assets due to an enacted law
change in the State of Ohio which reduced the amount of net
operating losses that the Company will be able to utilize in
future periods. In addition, the Company reversed previously
recorded tax reserves of $3,200 due to the expiration of the
statute of limitations for the tax years the recorded reserves
relate to and also reduced tax reserves by $279 based on an
evaluation of estimated tax exposures. During 2004, the Company
reversed $2,236 of valuation reserves related to federal net
operating losses that were deemed to be no longer required based
on managements estimates of future profitability of the
Company. The Company has six business units four in 2003
in India which are entitled to a tax holiday for 10 consecutive
years commencing with the year the business unit started
producing computer software or until the Indian tax year ending
March31, 2009, whichever is earlier. Once the tax holiday
period has expired, these business units are eligible to deduct
a portion of the profits attributable to export activities. The
deduction for export activities was 30% and expired during the
Indian tax year ended March31, 2004. The remaining business units are subject to the
tax holiday for various periods ranging from March31, 2005
through March31, 2009 and will not be able to avail
themselves of the deduction for export activities. As the tax
holiday expires, the Companys overall effective tax rate
will be negatively impacted. The tax benefit for this tax
holiday was approximately$4,727 for the year ended
December31, 2005. The Company had available U.S.Federal net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $5,326 as of
December31, 2005. The majority of the net operating loss
carryforward was acquired in an acquisition and its utilization
is limited to $688per year. This net operating loss
carryforward will expire in 2013. In addition, the Company has
available state and local operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $45,506 that expire at various dates through 2020
at a blended effective tax rate of 59%. 46 Table of Contents COVANSYS CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Dollars in thousands, except per share
data 17.Segment
Information The Company is a provider of IT services, with
locations throughout North America, India and Asia, and other
international locations. The chief operating decision-maker
evaluates each segments performance based primarily on its
revenue and income loss from operations due to the similarity
of the nature of services provided to clients. The geographic
segment revenue figures disclosed below are stated at full
attribution. Full attribution revenue is calculated using the
end customer invoice rate on intersegment engagements, as
opposed to using the transfer price rate. The chief operating
decision-maker does not evaluate segment performance based on
assets. Assets, including the related depreciation and
amortization expense, are managed primarily by corporate
management. In 2005, the chief operating decision-maker
realigned certain portions of the business and the operating
segments reducing the number of reported segments in prior years
from four operating segments and other to two operating segments
and other. The four operating segments reported in prior years
were Commercial, India/Asia, Public Sector and Europe. These
operating segments have been realigned into two
segments-Commercial and Public Sector. Segment information for
2004 and 2003 has been reclassified to conform to the 2005
presentation.   
Commercial includes all global services provided
to non public sector customers. Commercial includes application
services for maintenance and development outsourcing AMD/O,
retail, healthcare, distribution, manufacturing, financial
services, telecommunications, utilities, e-business, packaged
software implementation and other services.
Public Sector includes all services provided to
domestic state and local municipalities.
Other consists primarily of the labor and
supporting expenses for the Corporate functions, depreciation
and amortization expenses, lease expenses for corporate
headquarters.
The accounting policies of the operating segments
are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies in Note1. India/Asia geographic segment supplies
substantial resources to North American Customers. The rate
charged by India to U.S. has been developed utilizing a cost
plus transfer pricing methodology. This results in a large
component of the available gross profit accruing to North
America where the end customer is located. Segment information is presented below. Revenue

18.Commitments,
Contingencies and Potential Liability to Clients We are involved in tax and legal proceedings,
claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of
business. We periodically assess our liabilities and
contingencies in connection with these matters, based upon the
latest information available. For those matters where it is
probable that we have incurred a loss and the loss or range of
loss can be reasonably estimated, we have recorded reserves in
the consolidated financial statements. In other instances,
because of the uncertainties related to both the probable
outcome and amount or range of loss, we are unable to make a
reasonable estimate of a liability, if any. As additional
information becomes available, we adjust our assessment and
estimates of such liabilities accordingly. We do not believe 48 Table of Contents COVANSYS CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Dollars in thousands, except per share
data that the ultimate resolution of these matters
will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations, or cashflows. We believe that we have
adequate legal defenses and intend to defend these matters
vigorously. We have certain contracts with our state and
local clients that require us to provide a surety bond as a
guarantee of performance. As of December31, 2005, we had
13performance bonds outstanding and posted with clients,
with an aggregate total value of approximately $35,167 to secure
performance of contractual obligations with our clients.
Additionally, 14 letters of credit totaling $9,386 were
outstanding at December31, 2005. In general, we would only
be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of
default in the performance of our obligations under each
contract, the probability of which we believe is remote. We
believe that we have sufficient capacity in the surety markets
and liquidity from our cash flow and revolving credit facility
to meet ongoing business needs and to respond to future requests
for proposals from state and local governments. 19.Restructuring,
Merger and Other Related Charges In April 2003, the Company announced it would
realign the organization. The realignment which is complete,
aligned sales, subject matter expertise and delivery and
provided a strong foundation for the future growth and
profitability for the Company. As part of the realignment, the
Company reduced headcount in the second quarter of 2003 by over
200 net positions in North America or approximately 85% of
domestic headcount. The reduction in headcount was split with
over 80% of the eliminated positions billable and delivery
employees coming from cost of revenue with the remaining coming
from selling, general and administrative. During 2005, the Company recorded $491 of lease
termination costs. During 2004, the Company recorded $1,696 of
lease termination costs and $1,252 related to severance. Amounts
related to lease terminations will be paid out through 2011.
During 2003, the Company recorded costs of $4,208, split $1,834
included in cost of revenue and $2,374 included in selling,
general and administrative expenses, related to various
headcount reductions, including the reductions implemented
during the second quarter as discussed above, and termination of
lease obligations associated with the consolidation of
facilities. The following is a roll forward of the accrual

Net In November 2005 Oracle exercised its purchase
option to acquire PeopleSofts development center in
Bangalore, India operated by the Company. Approximately
430employees of the center became employees of Oracle.
Revenue generated from this development center for the Company
was $13,405 and $8,400 for the years ended December31,
2005 and 2004 respectively. No revenue was recorded in 2003.
Under terms of the agreement, Oracle is required to pay a buyout
fee of $1,000 and an amount which approximates the book value of
the net assets of the business. In accordance with the terms of
the agreement, Oracle has paid 80% of the amount owned as of
December31, 2005. The Company anticipates receipt of the
remaining proceeds by the end of the first quarter of 2006. In August, 2003, the Company was notified that
the Board of Directors and majority shareholders of one of the
Companys investments carried at cost had agreed to merge
with another entity. The merger consummated in August, 2003 and
the Company recognized a loss of approximately $680 which is
included in other income, net. 21.Other During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company
continued to perform services for one of its significant
customers after it had reached the authorized spending limit on
a time and material contract. While the Company believed it
would be paid for these services, management concluded that it
did not have a legally enforceable contractual right to the
revenue as of December31, 2004. As a result, in accordance
with the Companys revenue recognition policies, and Staff
Accounting Bulletin104, the Company recognized the costs
of providing the services, but did not recognize any revenue for
these services in 2004. Gross profit in the Commercial segment
was negatively impacted in the fourth quarter by approximately
$3,500. In 2005, the Company received a contract which covered
these services and recognized the revenue in the first quarter
of 2005, with a corresponding increase in gross profit.   
22.
Subsequent Event In March2006, the Company entered into an
agreement to sell the assets and certain liabilities of its
state and local consulting practice, which is included in the
Public Sector segment for reporting purposes, for up to $40,000.
The state and local consulting practice had the following

Certain operating expenses which are indirectly attributable to
the business are centrally managed at the corporate level and
have not been allocated. The agreement, which is contingent on the
Companys ability to meet certain closing conditions, also
requires the Company to provide a certain level of services to
the buyer from its operations in India at below market rates
through the end of 2007. Until such time as the transaction
closes, it is not possible for the Company to determine whether
the sale of the business will qualify for discontinued
operations reporting. 23.Supplemental
