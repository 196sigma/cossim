34 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders Intevac, Inc. We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Intevac, Inc.
as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income
loss, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2004. These
financial statements are the responsibility of management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatements. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Intevac, Inc. at December31, 2004
and 2003, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December31, 2004, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also, in our opinion, the data in the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of Intevac, Inc.s internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission and our report dated March22, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion on managements
assessment, and an adverse opinion on the effective operation,
of internal control over financial reporting.

Business and Nature of Operations We are the worlds leading provider of disk sputtering
equipment to manufacturers of magnetic media used in hard disk
drives and a developer and provider of leading technology for
extreme low light imaging sensors, cameras and systems. We
operate two businesses: Equipment and Imaging. Our Equipment business designs, manufactures, markets and
services complex capital equipment used in the sputtering, or
deposition, of highly engineered thin-films of material onto
magnetic disks which are used in hard disk drives. Hard disk
drives are the primary storage medium for digital data and
function by storing data on magnetic disks. These disks are
created in a sophisticated manufacturing process involving a
variety of many steps, including plating, annealing, polishing,
texturing, sputtering and lubrication. Our Imaging business develops and manufactures electro-optical
sensors, cameras, and systems that permit highly sensitive
detection of photons in the visible and near infrared portions
of the spectrum, allowing vision in extreme low light situations.   
2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Intevac and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All inter-company
transactions and balances have been eliminated.   
Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue using guidance from SEC Staff Accounting
BulletinNo. 104, Revenue Recognition. Our
policy allows revenue recognition when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility
is reasonably assured. On January1, 2003, we changed our
revenue recognition policy for system orders received after
December31, 2002. System Revenue Recognition for Orders Received After
December31, 2002. Certain of our system sales with
customer acceptance provisions are accounted for as
multiple-element arrangements. If we have previously met defined
customer acceptance levels with the specific type of system,
then we recognize revenue for the fair market value of the
system upon shipment and transfer of title, and recognize
revenue for the fair market value of installation and acceptance
services when those services are completed. For systems that
have generally not been demonstrated to meet product
specifications prior to shipment, revenue recognition is usually
deferred until customer acceptance. In the event that our
customer chooses not to complete installation and acceptance,
and our obligations under the contract to complete installation,
acceptance or any other tasks, with the exception of warranty
obligations, have been fully discharged, then we recognize any
remaining revenue to the extent that collectibility under the
contract is reasonably assured. The revenue recognition policy outlined above and implemented
for system orders received after December31, 2002 was
adopted to better conform our revenue recognition policies to
industry accounting practice for companies selling similar
equipment. The effect of adopting this policy in years prior to
2003 would have been no change in 2002 revenues. The effect on
net income loss of adopting this policy in years prior to 2003
would have been no effect on 2002net income. The adoption
of this policy had no effect on revenues or net loss in 2003. System Revenue Recognition for Orders Received Before
December31, 2002. Revenues for systems that were
ordered prior to December31, 2002 are recognized upon
customer acceptance. For memory and flat panel systems shipped
through a distributor, revenue is typically recognized after the
distributor has accepted the system at our factory and the
system has been shipped. For memory and flat panel systems sold
directly to end customers, revenue is recognized after
installation and acceptance of the system at the customer site. 40 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued When we believe that there may be higher than normal end user
installation and acceptance issues for systems shipped through a
distributor, such as when the first unit of a newly designed
system is delivered, we defer revenue recognition until the
distributors customer has also accepted the system. Accounting Treatment for Systems. For periods both before
and after December31, 2002, during the period that a
system is undergoing customer acceptance either distributor or
end user, the value of the system remains in inventory, and any
payments received, or amounts invoiced, related to the system
are included in customer advances. When revenue is recognized on
the system, the inventory is charged to cost of net revenues,
the customer advance is liquidated, and the customer is billed
for the unpaid balance of the system revenue. In some instances, hardware that is not essential to the
functioning of the system may be delivered after acceptance of
the system. In these cases, we estimate the fair market value of
the non-essential hardware as if it had been sold on a
stand-alone basis, and defer recognizing revenue on that value
until the hardware is delivered. Occasionally, we are asked by our customers to delay delivery of
products that they have accepted, and to temporarily hold the
product at our facility. To determine revenue recognition when
the product is not immediately shipped to the customer, we apply
the criteria outlined in the SEC Enforcement Release
No108, which is consistent with APB Statement4,
paragraph150. All of the criteria must be met in order for
revenue to be recognized. Other Systems and Non-System Revenue Recognition.
Revenues for systems without installation and acceptance
provisions, as well as revenues from technology upgrades, spare
parts, consumables and prototype products built by the Imaging
business are recognized when title passes to our customer.
Service and maintenance contract revenue, which to date has been
insignificant, is recognized ratably over applicable contract
periods or as the service is performed. Obligations After Shipment. Our shipping terms are
generally FOB shipping point, but in some cases are FOB
destination. For systems sold directly to the end user, our
obligations remaining after shipment typically include
installation, end user factory acceptance and warranty. For
systems sold to distributors, typically the distributor assumes
responsibility for installation and end user customer
acceptance. In some cases, the distributor will assume some or
all of the warranty liability. For products other than systems
and system upgrades, warranty is the only obligation we have
after shipment. Technology Development Revenue Recognition. We perform
research and development work under various government-sponsored
research contracts. Generally these contracts are best efforts
cost-plus-fixed-fee CPFF contracts or firm
fixed-price FFP contracts. On best efforts CPFF
contracts we typically commit to perform certain research and
development efforts up to an agreed upon amount. In connection
with these contracts, we receive funding on an incremental basis
up to a ceiling. On FFP contracts we typically commit to perform
certain development and production efforts for a fixed price. Our CPFF contracts are accounted for under ARB No43,
Chapter11, SectionA, which addresses
Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee Contracts. The contracts are all cost-type,
with financial terms that are a mixture of fixed fee, no fee and
cost sharing. Revenue on these contracts is recognized in
accordance with contract terms, typically as costs are incurred.
In the event that total cost incurred under a particular
contract over-runs its agreed upon amount, we may be liable for
the additional costs. Our FFP contracts are accounted for under SOP81-1
Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
Certain Production-Type Contracts. Revenue on FFP
contracts is generally recognized on the
percentage-of-completion method based on costs incurred in
relation to the total estimated costs. Provisions for estimated
losses on FFP research contracts are recorded in the period in
which such losses are determined. 41 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The deliverables under each CPFF or FFP contract range from
providing reports to providing hardware. In the majority of the
contracts there is no obligation for either party to continue
the program once the funds have been expended. The efforts can
be terminated at any time for convenience, in which case we
would be reimbursed for our actual incurred costs, plus fee, if
applicable, for the completed effort. We own the entire right,
title and interest to each invention discovered under the
contract, unless we specifically give up that right. The
U.S.Government has a paid-up license to use any
invention/intellectual property developed under government
funded contracts for government purposes only. In addition, we
have, from time to time, negotiated with third parties to fund a
portion of our costs in return for granting them a joint
interest in the technology rights developed pursuant to the
contract.   
Trade Receivables and Doubtful Accounts We evaluate the collectibility of trade receivables on an
ongoing basis and provide reserves against potential losses when
appropriate. Management analyzes historical bad debts, customer
concentrations, customer credit worthiness, changes in customer
payment tendencies and current economic trends when evaluating
the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Customer
accounts are written off against the allowance when the amount
is deemed uncollectible. Included in trade receivables are unbilled receivables related
to government contracts of $975,000 and $1,065,000 at
December31, 2004 and December31, 2003, respectively.   
Warranty Our typical warranty is 12months from customer acceptance.
We also sell extended warranties beyond 12months to some
customers. The warranty period on used systems is generally
shorter than 12months. During this warranty period any
defective non-consumable parts are replaced and installed at no
charge to the customer. The warranty period on consumable parts
is limited to their reasonable usable life. A provision for the
estimated warranty cost is recorded at the time revenue is
recognized. On the consolidated balance sheet, the short-term portion of the
of the warranty provision is included in Other Accrued
Liabilities, while the long-term portion is included in Other
Long-Term Liabilities. The following table displays the activity in the warranty

STATEMENTSContinued   
Guarantees We have entered into agreements with customers and suppliers
that include limited intellectual property indemnification
obligations that are customary in the industry. These guarantees
generally require us to compensate the other party for certain
damages and costs incurred as a result of third party
intellectual property claims arising from these transactions.
The nature of the intellectual property indemnification
obligations prevents us from making a reasonable estimate of the
maximum potential amount we could be required to pay our
customers and suppliers. Historically, we have not made any
significant indemnification payments under such agreements and
no amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements with respect to these indemnification
obligations.   
International Distribution Costs We make payments to agents and representatives under agreements
related to international sales in return for obtaining orders
and providing installation and warranty services. These payments
to agents and representatives are included in selling, general
and administrative expenses. These amounts totaled approximately
$0, $119,000 and $300,000 for the years ended December31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.   
Customer Advances Customer advances generally represent nonrefundable deposits
invoiced by the Company in connection with receiving customer
purchase orders and other events preceding acceptance of
systems. Customer advances related to products that have not
been shipped to customers and included in accounts receivable
were $16,000 and $47million at December31, 2004 and
2003, respectively.   
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments Our investment portfolio consists of cash, cash equivalents and
investments in debt securities. We consider all highly liquid
investments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents. Investments in debt securities
consist principally of highly rated debt instruments with
maturities generally between one and 25months. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No115 Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and based on
our intentions regarding these instruments, we have classified
our investments in debt securities as held-to-maturity and
account for these investments at amortized cost. Interest income
is recorded using an effective interest rate, with the
associated premium or discount amortized to interest income. The
table below presents the amortized principal amount, major
security type and maturities for our investments in debt
securities.

STATEMENTSContinued Cash and cash equivalents represent cash accounts and money
market funds. Included in accounts payable is $188,000 and
$635,000 of book overdraft at December31, 2004 and
December31, 2003, respectively.   
Valuation of Long-lived and Intangible Assets We assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and
long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors
we consider important which could trigger an impairment review
include the following   
significant underperformance relative to expected historical or
projected future operating results     
significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired
assets or the strategy for our overall business;and     
significant negative industry or economic trends. When we determine that the carrying value of long-lived assets,
intangibles or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the
existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment,
we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash
flow method using a discount rate determined by our management
to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current
business model.   
Prototype Costs Prototype product costs that are not paid for under research and
development contracts and are in excess of fair market value are
charged to research and development expense.   
Foreign Exchange Contracts We may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to
hedge certain of our foreign currency transaction, translation
and re-measurement exposures. Our accounting policies for some
of these instruments are based on our designation of such
instruments as hedging transactions. Instruments not designated
as a hedge transaction will be marked to market at
the end of each accounting period. The criteria we use for
designating an instrument as a hedge include effectiveness in
exposure reduction and one-to-one matching of the derivative
financial instrument to the underlying transaction being hedged.
Gains and losses on foreign currency forward exchange contracts
that are designated and effective as hedges of existing
transactions are recognized in income in the same period as
losses and gains on the underlying transactions are recognized
and generally offset. As of December31, 2004 and 2003, Intevac had no foreign
currency forward exchange contracts outstanding.   
Financial Instruments The carrying amount of the short-term financial instruments
cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts
receivable and certain other liabilities approximates fair
value due to the short-term maturity of those instruments. 44 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Inventories Inventories are priced using standard costs, which approximates
cost under the first-in, first-out method, and are stated at the
lower of cost or market. Inventories consist of the following

Finished goods inventory consists primarily of completed systems
at customer sites that are undergoing installation and
acceptance testing. Inventory reserves included in the above numbers were $99 and
$102million at December31, 2004 and
December31, 2003, respectively. Each quarter, we analyze
our inventory raw materials, work-in-progress and finished
goods against the forecast demand for the next 12months.
Raw materials with no forecast requirements in that period are
considered excess and inventory provisions are established to
write those items down to zero net book value. Work-in-progress
and finished goods inventories with no forecast requirements in
that period are typically written down to the lower of cost or
market. During this process, some inventory is identified as
having no future use or value to us and is disposed of against
the reserves. During the year ended December31, 2004, $14million
was added to inventory reserves based on the quarterly analyses
and $16million of inventory was disposed of and charged
to the reserve. A system in inventory with a value of $706,000,
net of a $250,000 reserve, was transferred to fixed assets and
capitalized. During the year ended December31, 2003, $743,000 was added
to inventory reserves based on the quarterly analyses and
$698,000 of inventory was disposed of and charged to the
reserve. Inventory reserves increased by an additional $588,000
due primarily to reserves charged against research and
development for prototype systems built in inventory.   
Property, Plant and Equipment Equipment and leasehold improvements are carried at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Gains and losses on
dispositions are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income Loss. Depreciation for machinery and equipment is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using
the shorter of the remaining terms of the lease or the estimated
economic useful lives of the improvements.   
Intangible Assets When amortizable intangibles exist, we amortize them on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which
range from two to seven years. At December31, 2004, 2003
and 2002 there were no intangible assets reported on our
consolidated balance sheet, or amortized to expense during the
years then ended.   
Comprehensive Income SFASNo130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income requires unrealized gains or losses on foreign
currency translation adjustments, which prior to the adoption
were reported separately in shareholders equity 45 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued to be included in other comprehensive income. As of
December31, 2004, the $253,000 balance of accumulated
other comprehensive income is comprised entirely of accumulated
foreign currency translation adjustments.   
Employee Stock Plans At December31, 2004, we had two stock-based employee
compensation plans, which are described more fully in
Note10. We account for those plans under the recognition
and measurement principles of APB Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related Interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation
cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under
those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of
the underlying common stock on the date of grant. We plan to
adopt the fair value requirements of SFASNo123R
beginning in the three-month period ended October1, 2005. Pro forma information regarding net income loss and earnings
loss per share is required by SFASNo123, which
also requires that the information be determined as if we had
accounted for our employee stock options granted subsequent to
December31, 1994 under the fair value method of this
Statement. The fair value for these options was estimated at the
date of grant using a Black-Scholes multiple option pricing
model with the following weighted average assumptions for 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively: risk-free interest rates of 360 162% and 164%; dividend yields of 00%, 00% and 00 volatility factors of the expected market price of
Intevacs common stock of 0946, 0943 and 0933; and a
weighted-average expected life of the option of 560, 222 and
268years. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use
in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no
vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option models require the input of highly subjective assumptions
including the expected stock price volatility. Because our
employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in
the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value
estimate, in managements opinion, the existing models do
not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair
value of its employee stock options. Under the 2003 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the
ESPP, we are authorized to issue up to
358,197shares of common stock to participating employees.
Under the terms of the ESPP, employees can choose to have up to
10% of their annual base earnings withheld to
purchaseIntevacs common stock. The purchase price of
the stock is 85% of the lower of the subscription date fair
market value or the purchase date fair market value. Under the
ESPP, we sold 82,184, 77,749 and 108,020shares to
employees in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As of
December31, 2004, 276,013shares remained reserved
for issuance under the ESPP. We do not recognize compensation
cost related to employee purchase rights under the plan. To
comply with the pro forma reporting requirements of
SFASNo123, compensation cost is estimated for the
fair value of the employees purchase rights using the
Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions for those
rights granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively: risk-free
interest rates of 237%, 143% and 112% dividend yield of 00 00% and 00%; expected volatility of 0952, 0940 and 0933;
and an expected life of 192, 200 and 150 the offering period
ends July31, 2006 for the subscription period that began
in August 2004. The weighted average fair value of those
purchase rights granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $295, $524
and $247, respectively per share. 46 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

and 1,328,278, respectively.   
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results inevitably
will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be
material to the financial statements.   
New Accounting Pronouncements In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF issued EITF00-21 Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF00-21
prescribes a method to account for contracts that have multiple
elements or deliverables. It provides guidance on how to
allocate the value of a contract to its different deliverables,
as well as guidance on when to recognize revenue allocated to
each deliverable over its performance period. The provisions of
EITF00-21 apply to revenue arrangements entered into in
the fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2003. The
adoption of EITF No00-21 did not have a material impact
on our financial statements. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFASNo150,
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.
SFASNo150 requires certain financial instruments
that have both equity and liability characteristics to be
classified as a liability on the balance sheet.
SFASNo150 is effective for the first interim period
beginning after June15, 2003. The adoption of this
statement did not have a material impact on our financial
statements. In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF
issued EITF No03-01, The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain
Investments, which provides new guidance for assessing
impairment losses on debt and equity investments. The new
impairment model applies to investments accounted for under the
cost or equity method and investments accounted for under
FAS115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities. EITF No03-01 also includes
new disclosure requirements for cost method investments and for
all investments that are in an unrealized loss position. In
September 2004, the FASB delayed the accounting provisions of
EITF No03-01; however the disclosure requirements remain
effective and the applicable disclosures have been included in
our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto.
We do not expect the adoption of this EITF to have an effect on
our financial statements. In June 2004, the EITF issued EITF No03-16,
Accounting for Investments in Limited Liability
Companies, which provides new guidance on determining
whether non-controlling investments in a Limited Liability
Company LLC should be accounted for under the cost
method or the equity method. EITF No. 03-16states that an
investment in an LLC that maintains a specific ownership
account for each investor should be viewed as similar to
an investment in a limited partnership for determining whether a
non-controlling investment in an LLC should be accounted for
using the cost or equity method. EITF No03-16 is
effective for the first interim reporting period beginning after
June15, 2004. The adoption of EITF No03-16 did not
have an effect on our financial statements. 48 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued In November 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo151,
Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB
No43, which is the result of its efforts to
converge U.S.accounting standards for inventories with
International Accounting Standards. SFASNo151
requires idle facility expenses, freight, handling costs, and
wasted material spoilagecosts to be recognized as
current-period charges. It also requires that allocation of
fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based
on the normal capacity of the production facilities.
SFASNo151 will be effective for inventory costs
incurred during fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005.
We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a
material impact on our financial statements. In December 2004, FASB issued SFASNo123 Revised
2004, Share-Based Payment. SFASNo123R
addresses all forms of share-based payment SBP
awards, including shares issued under certain employee stock
purchase plans, stock options, restricted stock and stock
appreciation rights. SFASNo123R will require us to
expense SBP awards with compensation cost for SBP transactions
measured at fair value. SFASNo123R requires us to
adopt the new accounting provisions beginning in our third
quarter of 2005. Although we are in the process of evaluating
the impact of applying the various provisions of
SFASNo123R, we expect that this statement will have
a material impact on our financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo153,
Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets, an amendment of APB
No29 which requires non-monetary exchanges to be
recorded at the fair value of the assets exchanged, with certain
exceptions. This standard requires most exchanges of productive
assets to be accounted for at fair value, rather than at
carryover basis. The provisions of SFASNo153 are
effective for fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005.
We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a
material impact on our financial statements.   
3.
Concentrations   
Credit Risk and Significant Customers Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist of cash equivalents,
short- and long-term investments, accounts receivable and
foreign exchange forward contracts. We generally invest our
excess cash in money market funds, commercial paper and in debt
securities of the US government and its agencies, which each
have contracted maturities of 25months or less and an
average maturity in aggregate of one year or less. By policy,
our investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposit,
Eurodollar time deposits, or bankers acceptances are rated
AAA or better. Our accounts receivable tend to be concentrated
in a limited number of customers. At December31, 2004, two
customers accounted for 30% and 16%, respectively of our
accounts receivables and in aggregate accounted for 46% of net
accounts receivable. At December31, 2003, two customers
accounted for 18% and 44%, respectively of our accounts
receivables and in aggregate accounted for 62% of net accounts
receivable. Our largest customers tend to change from period to period.
Historically, a significant portion of our revenues in any
particular period have been attributable to sales to a limited
number of customers. In 2004, two customers accounted for 62%
and 11%, respectively of our consolidated net revenues and in
aggregate accounted for 73% of net revenues. In 2003, four
customers accounted for 25%, 18%, 13% and 10%, respectively, of
our consolidated revenues and in aggregate accounted for 66% of
net revenues. In 2002, three customers accounted for 42%, 21 and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues and in
aggregate accounted for 74% of net revenues. Intevac performs
credit evaluations of its customers financial condition
and generally requires deposits on system orders but does not
generally require collateral or other security to support
customer receivables. 49 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Products Disk manufacturing products contributed a significant portion of
our revenues in 2004, 2003 and 2002. We expect that our ability
to maintain or expand our current levels of revenues and to
return to operating profitability in the future will depend upon
our success in enhancing our existing systems and developing and
manufacturing competitive disk manufacturing equipment, such as
our 200 Lean, and our success in developing both military and
commercial products based on our low light and LIVAR technology.   
4.
Sale of Rapid Thermal Processing Product Line In the fourth quarter of 2002, we sold our Rapid Thermal
Processing product line to Photon Dynamics, Inc.
PDI for $20million in cash and the
assumption of certain liabilities. $2million of the cash
payment was held in escrow and was not included in total assets
on the consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2002,
due to the contingencies related to the release of these funds
from escrow. In connection with this sale, we recorded a gain in
2002 of $154million, which is included in other income
and expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and
Comprehensive Income Loss. The following table recaps the gain
from the sale and the effect on Intevacs balance sheet for

Equity Investments   
601 California Avenue LLC In 1995, we entered into a Limited Liability Company Operating
Agreement the Operating Agreement, which expires
December31, 2015, with 601 California Avenue LLC the
LLC, a California limited liability company formed
and owned by Intevac and certain shareholders of Intevac at that
time. Under the Operating Agreement we transferred our leasehold
interest in the site of our discontinued night vision business
the Site in exchange for a preferred share in the
LLC with a face value of $3,900,000. We are accounting for the
investment under the cost method and have recorded our
investment in the LLC at $2,431,000, which represents our
historical carrying value of the leasehold interest in the Site.
The preferred share in the LLC pays a 10% annual cumulative
preferred dividend. During 1996, the LLC formed a joint venture with Stanford
University the Stanford JV. The Stanford JV
developed the property and has leased the property through
August 2009. The LLC is a profitable enterprise whose primary
asset is its interest in the Stanford JV. The Company received
dividends of $390,000 from the LLC in each of the last three
years. These dividends are included in other income and expense. 50 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Commitments We lease certain facilities under non-cancelable operating
leases that expire at various times up to February 2013. The
facility leases require Intevac to pay for all normal
maintenance costs. In February 2004, we executed a lease
amendment for our SantaClara facility which extended the
lease term to March 2012. Future minimum rental payments under these leases at

7.
Employee Benefit Plan In 1991, we established a defined contribution retirement plan
with 401k plan features. The plan covers all United States
employees eighteen years and older. Employees may make
contributions by a percentage reduction in their salaries, not
to exceed the statutorily prescribed annual limit. We made cash
contributions of $280,000, $234,000 and $276,000 for the years
ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Employees may choose among twelve investment options for their
contributions and their share of Intevacs contributions,
and they are able to move funds between investment options at
any time. Intevacs common stock is not one of the
investment options. Administrative expenses relating to the plan
are insignificant.   
8.
Convertible Notes During the first quarter of 1997, we completed an offering of
$575million of our
61/2%Convertible
Subordinated Notes the 2004 Notes, with a
March1, 2004 maturity date. Interest was payable each
March1stand September1st. The notes were
convertible into shares of Intevacs common stock at
$20625per share. Expenses associated with the offering of
approximately $23million were deferred. Such expenses
were amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes. On July12, 2002 we completed the exchange of
$363million in aggregate principal amount of our 2004
Notes for $295million of our new
61/2%Convertible
Subordinated Notes due 2009 the 2009 Notes and
$76million in cash, including $09million for
accrued interest. The 2009 Notes were convertible, at the
holders option, into Intevac common shares at a conversion
price of $700per share. $13million in aggregate
principal amount of the 2004 Notes remained outstanding after
the closing of the exchange offer. In accounting for the exchange of the convertible notes, we
wrote off $04million of debt issuance costs related to
the 2004 Notes, reflecting the portion of such costs
attributable to the convertible notes exchanged. The remaining
debt issuance costs were amortized to interest expense over the
remaining life of the 2004 Notes. In connection with the
exchange offer, we incurred $08million of offering costs.
Of this amount, $02million represented the cash portion
of the exchange offer and was expensed during the 3months
ended September28, 2002. The $06million balance of
the exchange offering costs were amortized to interest expense
over the life of the 2009 Notes. There was no gain or loss
associated with this transaction, as $363million of 2004
Notes were exchanged for $363million of cash and new
securities. 51 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued During 2002, in addition to the note exchange described above,
we repurchased $03million, face value, of our 2004 Notes.
The repurchase resulted in a gain of $23,000. In accordance with
adoption of SFASNo145, the gain on the note
repurchase is included in other income and expense, net on the
Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income
Loss. On October31, 2003, we issued a notice of automatic
conversion of our 2009 Notes pursuant to their terms.
$201million in aggregate principal amount of these notes
was outstanding, which converted into 2,871,857shares of
Intevac common stock at a conversion price of $700per
share. The automatic conversion occurred on November10,
2003. Prior to the issuance of the notice of automatic
conversion, $94million in aggregate principal amount of
these notes had been tendered for conversion by the holders,
resulting in the issuance of 1,348,426shares of Intevac
common stock. On March1, 2004, we paid off the remaining
$10million of our 2004 Notes.   
9.
Segment Reporting   
Segment Description We have two reportable operating segments: Equipment and
Imaging. Our Equipment business designs, manufactures, markets
and services complex capital equipment used in the sputtering,
or deposition, of highly engineered thin-films of material onto
magnetic disks which are used in hard disk drives. Our Imaging
business develops and manufactures electro-optical sensors,
cameras and systems that permit highly sensitive detection of
photons in the visible and near infrared portions of the
spectrum, allowing vision in extreme low light situations. Included in corporate activities are general corporate expenses,
less an allocation of corporate expenses to operating units
equal to 3%, 3% and 1% of net revenues in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Assets of corporate activities include unallocated
cash and short-term investments, deferred income tax assets
which were written off in 2001 and other assets.   
Segment Profit or Loss and Segment Assets We evaluate performance and allocate resources based on a number
of factors including, profit or loss from operations and future
revenue potential. The accounting policies of the reportable
segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies.

Shareholders Equity Our Articles of Incorporation authorize 10,000,000shares
of Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors has the authority to
issue the Preferred Stock in one or more series and to fix the
price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof,
including dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights,
voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices,
liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting
any series or the designation of such series, without further
vote or action by the shareholders.   
Stock Option/ Stock Issuance Plans Our Board of Directors and our shareholders approved adoption of
the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan the 2004 Plan in
2004. The 2004 Plan serves as the successor equity incentive
program to our 1995 Stock Option/ Stock Issuance Plan the
1995 Plan. Upon adoption of the 2004 Plan, all
shares available for issuance under the 1995 Plan were
transferred to the 2004 Plan. The 2004 Plan permits the grant of
incentive or non-statutory stock options, restricted stock,
stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance
shares. Option price, vesting period, and other terms are
determined by the Administrator of the 2004 Plan, but the option
price shall generally not be less than 100% of the fair market
value per share on the date of grant. As of December31,
2004, 2,558,232shares of common stock are authorized for
future issuance under the 2004 Plan. Options granted under the
2004 Plan are exercisable upon vesting and vest over periods of
up to five years. Options currently expire no later than ten
years from the date of grant. The 2004 Plan expires no later
than March10, 2014. In 2003, our shareholders approved adoption of the 2003 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan the 2003 ESPP which serves as
the successor to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan originally
adopted in 1995. Upon adoption of the 2003 ESPP, all shares
available for issuance under the prior plan were transferred to
the 2003 ESPP. As of December31, 2004, 276,013shares
of common stock are authorized for future issuance under the
2003 ESPP. 54 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

September25, 2004 by $43,000, $115,000 and $28,000,
respectively. The difference is due to the restatement discussed
in footnote14. The impact on basic and diluted earnings
per share reported is $001 for the three months ended

Restatement During the review of our internal controls, we identified
several Imaging Technology Development contracts where revenue
had not been recognized according to contract terms during 2004.
Accordingly, we adjusted our interim financial results for 2004
to correct the misstatements. We also included in this
restatement two timing inaccuracies in reported cost of sales
and a revision to the amount of other 57 Table of Contents INTEVAC, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued comprehensive income reported. These inaccuracies alone were not
material to our financial statements. The largest change to our
reported net income in any one quarter was $122,000. The change
in our reported basic and diluted earnings per share was a one
cent reduction for the three months ended June26, 2004 and
a one cent increase for the three months ended December31,

Controls and Procedures Managements Report on Assessment of Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined under Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of
its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud.
Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls
must be considered relative to their costs. As a result of these
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been
detected. These limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
because of a simple error or mistake. As a result of these
limitations, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur or
not be detected. Accordingly, the Companys disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures
are met. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, as required by Section404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment,
including testing, using the criteria in Internal
Control Integrated Framework, issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. In the course of this evaluation, we identified three
control deficiencies that constitute material weaknesses. As a
result of these three material weaknesses in our system of
internal controls we concluded that we did not maintain
effective internal controls over our financial reporting during
2004. A material weakness is a control deficiency within the meaning
of PCAOB Auditing Standard No2, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in there being more than a
remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
As of December31, 2004, we concluded that we did not
maintain effective controls over 1aspects of the Imaging
Business, 2approval of inventory cycle count
adjustments, and 3documentation related to our quarterly
review and approval of excess and obsolete inventory reserves.
Our evaluation is as follows   
Imaging Business - We determined during the course of our
year-end audit that projected, rather than approved, billing
rates were used to calculate revenue for cost-plus-fixed-fee
technology development contracts. In addition, journal entries
for revenue recognition and the related documentation were not
subjected to adequate review and approval.     
We also determined during the course of our year-end audit that
firm fixed-price technology development contracts were not being
accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP for firm fixed-price
contracts. This would have resulted in an overstatement of
revenue and operating profit had it not been discovered prior to
the public release of our 2004 earnings. During the first
quarter of 2005, we retrained our accounting staff in proper
application of revenue recognition policies and implemented
policies regarding analyzing contracts for proper revenue
recognition accounting.     
We determined during the course of our year-end audit that a
receivable greater than one year old had not been reserved as a
bad debt. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we implemented a
bad debt policy that required receivables aged more than one
year to be fully reserved. Our review did not include unbilled
receivables and we did not establish the appropriate bad debt
reserve. This would have resulted 59 Table of Contents   
in an understatement of bad debt expense and an overstatement of
operating profit had it not been discovered prior to the public
release of our earnings. We have changed our process for
evaluating accounts receivable to ensure that all balances are
reviewed for collectibility on a regular basis.     
Approval of Inventory Cycle Count Adjustments
We routinely cycle count our stockroom inventories and make
corrections to our inventory balances as a result of those cycle
counts. We determined late in 2004 that the cycle count
adjustments were being made, but without written approval by
management as required by our internal control policies.
Management authorization of cycle count adjustments is necessary
to reduce the potential of an employee using a cycle count
adjustment to conceal a theft of inventory. The requirement for
the appropriate management approval of all cycle count
adjustments was re-emphasized in December of 2004.     
Documentation of Excess and Obsolete Inventory Reserve
Calculation Review and Approval We determine, on
a quarterly basis, the level of reserves required related to
excess and obsolete inventory. Excess and obsolete inventory
reserves are an estimate which requires significant judgment on
the part of management. Our Chief Financial Officer reviews and
approves these estimates on a quarterly basis. Given the
significant nature of the estimate, we determined during the
course of our internal controls evaluations that improved
documentation of those reviews was needed. We will document the
quarterly management reviews of excess and obsolete calculations
beginning with the reviews performed in the first quarter of
2005. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004 has been audited by Grant Thornton LLP,
the Companys independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report which is included at
page61 herein.   
/s/ Kevin Fairbairn
/s/ Charles B. EddyIII
Changes in Internal Controls During 2004, we made numerous changes to our internal controls
and procedures as part of our ongoing evaluation, monitoring and
development of our internal controls. However, with the
exception of the changes noted in our Managements Report
on Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting, none
of the changes in the Companys internal control over
financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation
of such internal control during the Companys last fiscal
quarter materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief
Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such
term is defined under Rule13a-15e promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended. Based on this
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of December31, 2004 as a
result of the three material weaknesses identified above. 60 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Board of Directors and Shareholders Intevac, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Intevac, Inc. Managements Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting, that Intevac, Inc. did not
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2004, because of the effect of the material
weaknesses identified in managements assessment, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission COSO. Intevac, Inc.s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that
1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in a more than remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
following material weaknesses have been identified and included
in managements assessment   
The lack of appropriate internal controls over the Imaging
Business     
The approval of inventory cycle count adjustments, and     
The documentation related to the companys quarterly review
and approval of excess and obsolete inventory reserves. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the
nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit
of the 2004 consolidated financial statements, and this report
does not affect our report dated March22, 2005, on those
consolidated financial statements. 61 Table of Contents In our opinion, managements assessment that Intevac, Inc.
did not maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in
our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses
described above on the achievement of the objectives of the
control criteria, Intevac, Inc. has not maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
