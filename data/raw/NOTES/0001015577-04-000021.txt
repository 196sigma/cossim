Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data Independent
Auditors Report The Board of Directors
and StockholdersCNET Networks, Inc. We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of CNET Networks, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2003 and 2002 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders
equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2003. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatements. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of CNET Networks, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As discussed in note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets on January 1, 2002. s/ KPMG LLP San Francisco, CaliforniaJanuary 26, 2004 CNET NETWORKS, INC. CONSOLIDATED

See accompanying notes to the
consolidated financial statements. CNET NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO THE
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2003 1 DESCRIPTION OF
BUSINESS AND SIGNFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS CNET Networks, Inc. CNET is a
leading global media company informing and connecting buyers, users and sellers of
personal technology, games and entertainment, and business technology products. CNET was
incorporated in the state of Delaware in December 1992. PRINCIPLES OF
CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of CNET Networks Inc. and its wholly and majority owned and
controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. FOREIGN CURRENCY
TRANSLATION For operations in countries where the
functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, revenue and expense accounts are
translated at the average rates during the period, and balance sheet items are translated
at end-of-period rates. Translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income as a component of stockholders equity. Net gains and losses
resulting from foreign exchange transactions are included in the consolidated statements
of operations. USE OF ESTIMATES CNETs management has made a
number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare
these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. Actual results could differ from those estimates. RECLASSIFICATION Certain amounts in the financial
statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to current year
classification. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS The carrying value of CNETs
cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, accounts receivable and accounts
payable approximate their respective fair values. The carrying value of CNETs 5%
Convertible Subordinated Notes is deemed to be their fair value since it is impracticable
to estimate a fair value as there is no comparable debt available on the market. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CNET invests its excess cash in debt
instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies and in high-quality corporate issuers.
All highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less at the date of
purchase are considered cash equivalents. RESTRICTED CASH The restricted cash balance primarily
relates to certain deposits in escrow held as collateral for letters of credit relating to
security deposits on leased properties. SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT
INVESTMENTS Investments in marketable debt
securities with maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase and current
maturities less than twelve months from the balance sheet date are considered current
assets. Those with maturities greater than twelve months from the balance sheet date are
considered non-current assets. CNETs marketable debt
securities are classified as available-for-sale as of the balance sheet date and are
reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in
stockholders equity. Realized gains or losses and permanent declines in value, if
any, on available-for-sale securities are reported in other income or expense as incurred. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT
RISK Financial instruments potentially
subjecting CNET to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash
equivalents, investments and trade accounts receivable. CNET invests excess cash in low
risk, liquid instruments. CNETs investments in marketable debt securities are
generally investment grade securities. CNETs investments in privately held companies
are concentrated in the information technology sector and as such are subject to
fluctuations in fair value based on technology market factors. The majority of CNETs
accounts receivable are derived from domestic sales to companies in the information
technology sector. CNET closely monitors its outstanding receivable balances on an ongoing
basis. For the years ended December 31, 2003
and 2001, there were no revenues from one single customer that exceeded 10% of total
revenues. Revenues from one U.S. Media customer, Gateway Inc., approximated 12% of total
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002. Of these revenues from this customer in
2002, approximately 69% were generated from custom publishing contracts. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The principal
estimated useful lives are: buildings, 40 years; furniture and equipment, 3 to 7 years,
website development costs, 5 years; and computer equipment and software, 3 years. Property
and equipment recorded under capital leases and leasehold improvements are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease terms or their estimated useful lives. INCOME TAXES Income tax expense has been recorded
based on an estimated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2003. The
estimated effective tax rate has taken into account any change in the valuation allowance
for deferred tax assets where the realization of various deferred tax assets is subject to
uncertainty. Management believes that sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the future
realization of deferred tax assets and, accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been
provided against gross deferred tax assets. During 2003, CNET was refunded approximately
$86 million of recoverable taxes. In 2002, CNET was refunded approximately $317 million
of recoverable taxes. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED
ASSETS  CNET reviews its long-lived assets if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison
of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted and without interest
charges future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are
considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by
which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to
sell. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE
ASSETS In July 2001, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 142 by CNET on January 1, 2002, the impairment
of enterprise-wide goodwill was evaluated based on a comparison of CNETs net book
value to the estimated undiscounted and without interest charges future cash flows for
CNET. Conditions that indicated that impairment of goodwill should be evaluated included a
significant decrease in CNETs market value or a current period cash flow loss
combined with a history of cash flow losses. Effective January 1, 2002 under SFAS
142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized,
but instead are to be tested for impairment at least annually. Intangible assets with
definite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their respective estimated useful
lives. Although the provisions of SFAS 142 were not effective in their entirety until
January 1, 2002, the goodwill acquired in business combinations which occurred after June
30, 2001 fell under the condition of SFAS 142 requiring no amortization of goodwill
arising from transactions completed after June 30, 2001. Therefore, goodwill from any such
transactions was not amortized. Had the provisions of SFAS 142 been
effective in 2001, CNETs adjusted net loss and net loss per share would have been as
follows: in thousands, except per share data

Goodwill and intangible assets of a
reporting unit are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of its goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable.
Impairment of reporting unit goodwill is evaluated based on a comparison of the reporting
units carrying value to the implied fair value of the reporting unit. Conditions
that indicate that impairment of goodwill should be evaluated include a sustained decrease
in our market value or an adverse change in business climate. CNET reviews goodwill for
impairment on at least an annual basis. CNET has established August 31 as the valuation
date on which this annual review takes place. CNET performed its annual evaluation
of goodwill and intangible assets impairment as of August 31, 2003. CNET determined that
the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets for all its reporting units did
not exceed their implied fair values. REVENUE RECOGNITION AND
COLLECTIBILITY OF RELATED RECEIVABLE CNET recognizes revenues once the
following criteria are met: o 
Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists o 
Delivery of our obligation to our customer has occurred o 
The price to be charged to the buyer is fixed or determinable o 
Collectibility of the fees to be charged is reasonably assured CNET has several revenue streams. For
each revenue stream, evidence of the arrangement, delivery and pricing may be different.
For all revenue streams, CNET determines that collectibility is reasonably assured through
a standardized credit review to determine each customers credit worthiness. Marketing Services CNET recognizes revenues from the
sale of impression-based advertisements on its online network in the period in which the
advertisements are delivered. The arrangements are evidenced either by insertion order or
contract that stipulate the types of advertising to be delivered and pricing. CNETs
customers are billed based on a discounted list price with no amounts subject to refund.
When recognizing revenues, the discounts granted are applied to each type of advertisement
purchased based on the relative fair value of each element. CNET refers to the fees charged to
merchants based on the number of users who click on an advertisement or text link to visit
websites of CNETs merchant partners as activity-based advertising. For
activity-based advertising, the arrangement is evidenced by a contract that stipulates the
fee per activity. The fee becomes fixed and determinable upon our user clicking on an
advertisement. These revenues are recognized in the period in which the activity occurs,
and are not subject to refund. In certain arrangements, CNET sells
multiple deliverables to customers as part of a multiple-element arrangement. For these
arrangements, CNET allocates revenue to each deliverable based on the relative fair value
of each deliverable. Revenue is recognized in these arrangements as CNET delivers on its
obligation. CNET trades advertising on its
Internet sites in exchange for marketing services of other companies, referred to as
barter revenue. These revenues are recognized in the period in which the
advertisements are delivered based on the fair market value of the services delivered.
CNET determines the fair market value of the service delivered based upon amounts charged
for similar services in non-barter deals within the previous six-month period. Barter
revenues were approximately $118 million, $116 million and $184 million for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In 2001, a portion of CNETs
revenues was received in the form of securities of its customers. Revenues in the form of
securities of CNETs customers amounted to $47 million for the year ended December
31, 2001. There were no such revenues in 2003 and 2002. Licensing, Fees and Users Revenues for subscriptions to
CNETs Internet sites, print publications, product database and procurement services
are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the subscription. Upon execution
of a contract, billing and commencement of the services, CNET records deferred revenue for
the fee charged. This deferred revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
period of the arrangement. The amounts under contract are not refundable after the
customer has used the service. Publishing Advertising revenues from CNETs
print and custom print publications are recognized in the month that the related
publications are sent to subscribers or become available at newsstands. Newsstand revenue
from print publications is recognized when the publications are delivered to the newsstand
at which time a reserve is recorded against the value of the publications delivered based
on the number of magazines that CNET expects to be returned. To ensure these reserves are
adequate, CNET reviews the sell-through history of the publications on a monthly basis. Collectibility of
Receivables CNET maintains allowances for
doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to
make required payments. CNET bases its allowances on periodic assessment of its
customers liquidity and financial condition through credit rating agencies reports,
financial statement reviews and historical collection trends. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION CNET accounts for its stock-based
employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method. As such, compensation
expense is recorded on the date of grant if the current market price of the underlying
stock exceeded the exercise price. The compensation expense is recorded over the vesting
period of the grant. CNET applies APB Opinion No. 25 in
accounting for its stock-based compensation plans and, accordingly, no compensation cost
has been recognized for the plans in the financial statements because options are granted
at the current market price. Had CNET determined compensation cost based on the fair value
at the grant date for its stock options under SFAS 123, CNETs net loss and net loss
per share would have been increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below: in thousands, except per share data

The effect of applying SFAS 123 in
this pro forma disclosure is not indicative of the effects on reported results for future
periods. SFAS No. 123 does not apply to awards prior to 1995. The weighted-average fair
value of options granted in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $396, $271 and $572, respectively.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black
Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for
grants in 2003, 2002 and 2001:

Beginning with the third quarter of
fiscal 2003, CNET decreased the estimate of the expected life of new options granted to
employees from five years to three years. CNET based its expected life assumption on
historical experience as well as the terms and vesting periods of the options granted. The
reduction in the estimated expected life was a result of an analysis of CNETs
historical experience. ADVERTISING EXPENSE The cost of advertising is expensed
as incurred. Such costs are included in selling and marketing expense and totaled
approximately $160 million, $176 million and $376 million during the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  BENEFIT PLANS In 1996, CNET adopted a 401k Profit
Sharing Plan the 401 k Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401k of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The 401k Plan covers substantially all of
CNETs U.S. based employees, who may contribute up to 25% of their annual
compensation, subject to a limitation of $12,000 in 2003. Employees vest immediately in
their contributions and earnings thereon. The plan allows for company matching
contributions which amount to 50% of the employees contribution, up to 4%, with a
maximum annual match for 2003 of $1,500. Employees vest in CNETs contributions at
50% after one year of service and 100% after two years of service. For the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, CNET made matching contributions of $ 10 million, $12
million and $14 million, respectively. NET INCOME LOSS PER
SHARE Basic net income loss per share is
computed using the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock and
diluted net income loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of
outstanding shares of common stock and common stock equivalents during the period, to the
extent that such common stock equivalents are not anti-dilutive. Common stock equivalents
that are anti-dilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted net income loss per
share. WEB SITE DEVELOPMENT COSTS The Emerging Issues Task Force EITF
Issue No. 00-2, Accounting for Web Site Development Costs requires that costs
incurred during the development of web site applications and infrastructure involving
developing software to operate the web site, including graphics that effect the look
and feel of the web page and all costs relating to software used to operate a web
site should be accounted for under Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for
the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. However, if a
plan exists or is being developed to market the software externally, the costs relating to
the software should be accounted for pursuant to FASB Statement No. 86, Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. In
2001, CNET commenced the development of a standard delivery platform for its Internet
network. CNET believes this created a better product for users and a better marketing
platform for advertisers and resulted in internal cost and delivery efficiencies. Costs of
approximately $184 million to date have been capitalized pursuant to SOP 98-1, including
$35 million in 2003. RECENT ACCOUNTING
PRONOUNCEMENTS In November 2002, the FASB issued a
Consensus, which clarified certain issues within EITF 00-21, Revenue Arrangements
with Multiple Deliverables. The Consensus addresses how to allocate the revenue in
an arrangement involving multiple deliverables into separate units of accounting
consistent with the identified separate earnings processes of each deliverable for revenue
recognition purposes. The Issue also addresses how each element in a multiple-element
sales arrangement should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in
the arrangement. The Consensus is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in
fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The implementation of this Consensus has not
had a material effect on our operating results or financial position. In December 2003, the FASB issued
FASB Interpretation FIN 46 revised December 2003, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether
it has a controlling interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and,
accordingly, should consolidate the entity. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which was issued in January 2003.
FIN 46R is required to be applied to variable interests in variable interest entities
VIEs created after December 31, 2003. For variable interests in VIEs created before
January 1, 2004, the Interpretation will be applied beginning on January 1, 2004. For any
VIEs that must be consolidated under FIN 46R that were created before January 1, 2004, the
assets liabilities and non-controlling interests of the VIE initially would be measured at
their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance
sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of
an accounting change. If determining the carrying amounts is not practicable, fair value
at the date FIN 46R first applies may be used to measure the assets, liabilities and
non-controlling interest of the VIE. We are currently analyzing the impact of applying FIN
46R, however, we believe that the application of FIN 46R will not have a material impact
on our consolidated financial statements. 2 BALANCE SHEET

acquired Haosi Zhide Event and Exhibition Company, Ltd., located in China, which engages
in planning and organizing events and exhibitions and provides conference services. On
December 2, 2003, CNET acquired the intellectual property of MP3.com. The aggregate
purchase price for all five unrelated acquisitions was $31 million. A total of $29
million was paid in cash with the remainder outstanding under a note payable that is to be
paid within two years of the acquisition. The transactions have been accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting. The total purchase price has been
allocated to the tangible and intangible assets based on estimates of their respective
fair values. The aggregate purchase price of $31 million has been allocated, on a
preliminary basis, to tangible assets of approximately $435,000. intangible assets of
approximately $842,000 that are being amortized over a three-year period, and goodwill of
approximately $24 million. In addition, $544,000 of liabilities were assumed. The
weighted average life of the intangibles acquired from these transactions is three years. 2002 Acquisitions CNET made several small acquisitions
during 2002. In the second quarter of 2002, CNET acquired intellectual property and other
assets of Upgradebase.com, Inc., a provider of content specifications for memory and
memory upgrades, as well as other computer products and peripherals, Vendorbase.com, Inc.,
a provider of information covering remarketed IT products, and Smartshop.com, Inc., a
provider of online comparison shopping infrastructure. In the third quarter of 2002, CNET
acquired intellectual property and certain other assets of NewMediary, which operates an
IT white paper directory; WAAG Technologies, a Japanese IT consulting company, and
Silicon.com located in the UK, which operates Internet sites providing industry news,
analysis and employment recruitment services targeted toward European IT professionals.
Additionally, in October 2002, CNET exchanged its original minority ownership interest in
a Korean company that is the licensee and operator of CNETs ZDNet brand and online
content in Korea for a 630% interest in the newly restructured company, CNET Networks
Korea Co, Ltd. These acquisitions have been reflected in the balance sheet at December 31,
2002. The statement of operations of CNET for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes
the results of operations of these businesses since the dates of their respective
acquisitions. These acquisitions were accounted for
by the purchase method of accounting. The aggregate purchase price of $98 million for
these transactions, consisting of $88 million in cash and $10 million in notes payable,
has been allocated to tangible and intangible assets based on estimates of their
respective fair values. The aggregate purchase price was allocated as $86 million to
goodwill, $13 million to intangible assets, $27 million to other assets, and $28
million to assumed liabilities. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142, goodwill
arising from these transactions has not been amortized. The weighted average life of the
intangibles acquired from these transactions is three years. 2001 Acquisitions On July 1, 2001, CNET acquired
TechRepublic, Inc. TechRepublic from Gartner, Inc. The total purchase price was $216
million. CNET paid approximately $108 million in cash and issued 773,341 shares common
stock valued at approximately $78 million in exchange for all outstanding shares of
TechRepublic stock. Acquisition costs were approximately $30 million. The number of
shares of common stock exchanged was based on the average closing price of CNET stock for
ten consecutive trading days ending on the second trading day immediately prior to the
closing. The transaction was accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting. The total purchase price of $216 million was
allocated as follows: intangible assets of approximately $70 million, goodwill of $139
million, other assets of $76 million primarily consisting of accounts receivable of $20
million and fixed assets of $47 million, and liabilities of $69 million. Although the provisions of SFAS 142
were not effective in their entirety until January 1, 2002, the goodwill acquired in this
purchase fell under the condition of SFAS 142 requiring no amortization of goodwill
arising from a transaction completed after June 30, 2001. Therefore, goodwill arising from
this transaction has not been amortized. 4

Given the declines in the equity markets and in
CNETs stock price during the third quarter of 2002, the results of CNETs
annual impairment test performed as of August 31, 2002 indicated the carrying value of
goodwill and other intangible assets for the U.S. Media reporting unit exceeded their
implied fair values, and an impairment charge of $2388 million for goodwill and $405
million for intangible assets of that reporting unit was recorded in the third quarter of
2002. Additionally, certain other assets, including fixed assets, totaling $112 million
were deemed to be impaired and were written-off. 6 DEBT Below is a summary of CNETs

As a result of the ZDNet acquisition
on October 17, 2000, CNET assumed $614,000 of notes payable. These notes remained
outstanding after a tender offer by Ziff-Davis of its 8% Senior Subordinated Notes
due 2008 with interest payable semiannually on May 1 and November 1. As a result of the acquisition on
July 27, 1999 of CNET Channel Services, S.A. formerly known as GDT, CNET assumed a Swiss
France 5% mortgage loan for the building owned by CNET Channel Services, S.A. with a
principal balance of $700,000 as of December 31, 2000. The term of the loan is 36 years.
On April 24, 2000, CNET Channel Services, S.A., acquired more property that CNET funded
with additional Swiss Franc 5% mortgage loans of $24 million over a 20-year term. At
December 31, 2003, CNETs obligation under these loans was $38 million. On March 8, 1999, CNET completed a
private placement with gross proceeds of $1729 million of 5% Convertible Subordinated
Notes, due 2006 the Notes. The Notes are convertible into CNETs common stock after
June 7, 1999 at a conversion price of $3741 per share, subject to certain conditions, at
the option of the note holder. CNETs obligations with respect to the 5% Convertible
Subordinated Notes can be found in the indenture for such notes filed as Exhibit 1040 to
CNETs Annual Report on 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1998. During 2002, CNET
paid $367 million to repurchase $592 million principal amount of the 5% Convertible
Subordinated Notes, resulting in a gain of $216 million, net of the write-off of related
capitalized debt issuance costs of $09 million. At December 31, 2003, a total of $1137
million of the Notes remained outstanding. The aggregate annual principal

The net change in the valuation
allowance for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was an increase of $229
million, $202 million and $1299 million, respectively. In assessing the realizability of
deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during
the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers
the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and
tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Income tax expense has been recorded
based on an estimated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2003. The
estimated effective tax rate has taken into account any change in the valuation allowance
for deferred tax assets where the realization of various deferred tax assets is subject to
uncertainty. Management believes that sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the future
realization of deferred tax assets and, accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been
provided. Approximately $86 million of
recoverable taxes were refunded to CNET in 2003. At December 31, 2003, CNET had net
operating losses of $3274 million consisting of U.S. net operating losses of $2183
million and of cumulative foreign net operating losses of $1091 million. These losses
will be carried forward to offset taxable income generated in future years. Approximately
$650 million of these losses are related to federal net operating losses from the ZDNet
acquisition, which took place in 2000. These losses are subject to limitations on their
utilization due to the change in ownership and will begin to expire in 2011. Operating
losses generated in 2003 were primarily related to amortization of intangible assets and
losses from operations. 8 STOCKHOLDERS

At the annual meeting of stockholders
on June 12, 2002, CNETs stockholders approved the amendment of CNETs stock
option plans to permit the exchange of options having a strike price in excess of $1200
for a lesser number of new options to be granted at least six months and one day from
cancellation of the surrendered options. The offer to participate in the exchange expired
on July 26, 2002. All surrendered options were cancelled as of July 27, 2002. A total of
8,690,250 options were surrendered. On January 28, 2003, 3,218,547 options were regranted
at an exercise price of $2535. The regranted options retained the same vesting schedule
as the options they replaced, subject to a six-month standstill period that expired on
July 28, 2003. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE
PLAN In July 1996, CNET adopted an
Employee Stock Purchase Plan that covers substantially all domestic employees, whereby
participants may elect to purchase CNETs stock. The purchase price varies each
quarter and is 85% of the lower of the closing price at the beginning of the quarter and
the closing price at the end of the quarter for the first and third quarters of the year
or the lower of the closing price at the beginning of the prior quarter and the closing
price at the end of the current quarter for the second and fourth quarters of the year.
Employee contributions consist of a percentage of their compensation. The maximum
percentage of compensation that an employee may contribute to purchase CNET stock is 15%. 9

CONTINGENCIES Leases CNET has several non-cancelable
operating leases primarily for general office facilities and equipment that expire over
the next 16 years. Future minimum lease payments at December 31, 2003 under these leases
are as follows:    in thousands

Minimum payments have not been reduced
by minimum sublease rentals of $37 million due through August 2005 under noncancelable
subleases. Sublease income from operating leases was $26 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003, of which $18 million related to subleases for abandoned properties,
and therefore was taken to the lease abandonment accrual. Rental expense from operating
leases totaled $181 million, $198 million, and $156
million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Effective
August 1, 2002, the lease for CNETs headquarters in San Francisco was amended
whereby the rent on the lease was reduced by an aggregate amount of $451 million over the
remaining term of the lease in exchange for an $80 million payment and the posting of a
$20 million letter of credit for three years. The $80 million payment was recorded as
prepaid rent and is being recognized into lease expense over the remaining lease term. CNET had $743,000, $981,000 and
$623,000 of computer equipment under capital leases at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Total accumulated amortization on these assets was $543,000, $447,000 and
$94,000 at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Depreciation expense applicable
to these capitalized leases was $248,000, $377,000 and $94,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. At December 31, 2003, the remaining portion of the
future payments under these leases of $171,000 is included in accrued liabilities. Guarantee In conjunction with the ZDNet
acquisition in 2000, CNET assumed a guarantee of the obligations of Ziff Davis Media Inc.,
an unaffiliated company, under a New York City office lease for a total of 399,773 square
feet. In connection with that guarantee, we also have a letter of credit for $152 million
outstanding as a security deposit. This letter of credit is collateralized by a deposit in
escrow, which is included in restricted cash. As there is no present obligation to make
any payments in connection with this guarantee, CNET has not recorded any liability for
this guarantee in its financial statements. This lease expires in 2019. The annual average
cost per square foot is approximately thirty dollars over the remaining term of the lease.
Through a sublease from Ziff Davis Media Inc., CNET currently occupies 49,140 square feet
of the office space covered under this lease. Ziff Davis Media Inc. currently occupies
144,682 square feet of this space. There are three additional subleases, The Bank of New
York, FOJP Risk Management and Softbank, who collectively occupy a total of 205,951 square
feet. During 2002, Softbank subleased its 30,885 square feet to The Beanstalk Group. In
2003, Ziff-Davis Media Inc. subleased 61,494 square feet of space formerly occupied by
Ziff Davis Medias operations to FOJP Risk Management. As of December 31, 2003, the
total lease payments remaining until the end of the lease term were $1785 million,
excluding the amounts attributable to CNETs sublease. If the financial condition of
any of the sublessees or the primary lessee were to deteriorate and thereby result in an
inability to make their lease payments, CNET would be required to make their lease
payments under the guarantee. Lease Abandonment In 2001, CNET performed an evaluation
of its domestic and international real estate requirements. This evaluation resulted in
the consolidation or abandonment of several leased facilities. In connection with these
abandoned leases, CNET established an accrual for lease abandonment. The balance in this
accrual was $98 million at December 31, 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2003,
cash expenditure reductions to this accrual were $92 million, and an additional $45
million was added to the accrual due to modifications of certain assumptions regarding the
timing of subleasing the facilities and higher than anticipated costs to terminate two of
the leases. At December 31, 2003, a balance of $51 million remained in this accrual. The
total undiscounted liability under these leases, assuming that the spaces cannot be
sublet, is approximately $66 million. Legal In August 1999, Simon Property Group
SPG filed a trademark infringement suit in federal district court in Indianapolis
against mySimon, Inc. mySimon, a subsidiary of CNET acquired on February 29, 2000. SPG
alleged that the mySimon trademark infringed SPGs Simon trademark. On
August 31, 2000, following a trial on the subject, the jury found in favor of SPG and
awarded damages against mySimon in the amount of $115 million in compensatory damages 53 million for corrective advertising, and $100 million in punitive damages. On
September 25, 2000, the court entered an order establishing an escrow for royalties
pending final resolution of the litigation where mySimon pays into escrow 2% of its gross
cash receipts each month. On December 7, 2001, mySimon filed a
motion for a dismissal of the case or, alternatively a new trial based on newly discovered
evidence it believes SPG should have produced prior to the August 2000 trial. On March 26,
2003, the court granted mySimons motion for a new trial on all issues, thereby
eliminating the original jury verdict. The court also granted mySimons motion that
sanctions be imposed against SPG and reserved a decision about what the appropriate
sanctions should be until later proceedings. No date for a new trial has been set. It is
not possible to predict the amount of damages, if any, that could be awarded in a
re-trial; however, such amounts could be material to our results of operations and
financial condition. Two shareholder class action lawsuits
were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on
August 16, 2001 and September 26, 2001, against Ziff-Davis, Eric Hippeau and Timothy
OBrien, and investment banks that were the underwriters of the public offering of
ZDNet series of Ziff-Davis stock the ZDNet Offering. One of the complaints also names
CNET as a defendant, as successor in liability to Ziff-Davis. The complaints are similar
and allege violations of the Securities Act of 1933, and one of the complaints also
alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaints allege the
receipt of excessive and undisclosed commissions by the underwriters in connection with
the allocation of shares of common stock to certain investors in the ZDNet Offering and
agreements by those investors to make additional purchases of stock in the aftermarket at
pre-determined prices. Plaintiffs allege that the prospectus for the ZDNet Offering was
false and misleading and in violation of the securities laws because it did not disclose
the arrangements. The action seeks damages in an unspecified amount. The action is being
coordinated with over 300 nearly identical actions filed against other companies and their
underwriters. On February 19, 2003, the Court granted CNETs motion to dismiss the
Section 10b claim with leave to replead, and denied the motion to dismiss the Section 11
claim. The majority of the issuers,
including CNET, and their insurers have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with
the plaintiffs to dismiss the issuers from the litigation in exchange for a
back-stop guarantee from the issuers and their insurers pursuant to which they
will pay the plaintiffs any shortfall between $1 billion and the amounts recovered in the
ongoing litigation against the underwriters. The parties are currently negotiating
definitive settlement documents, which are subject to the approval of the court. Based on
its insurance coverage and the number of issuers participating in the settlement, if the
settlement is finalized CNET does not believe that it will face any material liability as
a result of the litigation. If the settlement does not occur, CNET intends to seek
indemnification from the underwriters, and it is not possible to predict whether the
litigation will have a material adverse effect on CNETs financial condition or
results of operations. There are no other legal proceedings
to which we are a party, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business
that is not expected to be material to our business or financial condition. 11 SEGMENTS CNETs primary areas of
measurement and decision-making include three principal business segments. Based upon the
criteria established by SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information, CNET has determined that its business segments are U.S. Media,
International Media and Channel Services. U.S. Media consists of an online network focused
on three content categories: personal technology, games and
entertainment, business technology. International Media includes the
delivery of online technology information and several technology print publications in non
U.S. markets. Channel Services includes a product database licensing business and an
online technology marketplace for resellers, distributors and manufacturers. As we
continue to see a convergence of customer relationships between U.S. Media and the Channel
Service product offerings, we will evaluate combining the reporting of the results of
Channel Services within U.S. Media in 2004. Summarized information by segment as
excerpted from the internal management reports is as follows:    in thousands

Since operating income loss before
depreciation, amortization and asset impairment is the measure of operating performance
that management uses for making decisions and allocating resources, certain operating
costs are not allocated across segments. These unallocated operating costs, included in
Other in the tables above, represent all costs related to the realignment of
CNETs business and all depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as asset
impairment and disposal charges. For the year ended December 30, 2003, Other
includes $98 million of realignment expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses
of $236 million. The $98 million of realignment expenses consisted of $28 million of
lease abandonment expense, $890,000 of costs associated with the termination of
CNETs on-air radio operations, and $61 million of severance relating to 135
employees. This $98 million of expense was included in the statement of operations as
$39 million in cost of revenue, $925,000 in sales and marketing and $50 million in
general and administrative expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2002,
Other includes $2905 million of asset impairment, $124 million of
realignment expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses of $604 million. The
$124 million of realignment expenses consisted of $44 in lease abandonment charges, $80
million in severance relating to 220 employees and other realignment related expenses.
This $124 million of expense was included in the statement of operations as $778,000 in
cost of revenue, $339,000 in sales and marketing and $113 million in general and
administrative expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2001, Other includes
$430 million of realignment expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses of $7030
million and $11 billion in asset impairment charges. The $430 million of integration
expenses consisted of $213 million in lease abandonment charges, which were included in
general and administrative expenses and $217 million of severance relating to 457
employees and other realignment related expenses. This $217 million of expenses was
included in the statement of operations as $87 million in cost of revenue, $20 million
in sales and marketing and $110 million in general and administrative expenses. Assets are not allocated to segments
for internal reporting purposes. Segment operating income loss before realignment
expenses and depreciation and amortization should not be considered a substitute for
operating income, cash flows or other measures of financial performance prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following table presents revenues

12 GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION CNET has wholly-owned operations in
Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In
addition, CNET has joint ventures in China and Korea, wherein CNET is a majority owner.
Those joint ventures are consolidated and operate advertising, publishing and events
businesses with aggregate assets of approximately $81 million. Any losses incurred by
these companies will be funded by CNET. Revenue is attributed to individual
countries according to the international online property or print publication that
generated the revenue. International revenues accounted for 21%, 17% and 14% of net
revenues during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. No single
foreign country accounted for more than 10% of net revenues for the year ended December
31, 2003. The following table sets forth net revenues

TRANSACTIONS In January 2003, CNET paid Clear
Channel Communications $250,000 as a final payment for the exclusive right to provide
programming and sell advertising on one of Clear Channels San Francisco radio
stations. Also in January 2003, CNET and Clear Channel agreed to the early termination of
that agreement in exchange for CNET paying Clear Channel $600,000, which represented a
reduction from CNETs remaining obligations under the agreement. The termination of the
agreement followed CNETs decision to discontinue its broadcast radio operations.
Randall Mays, a Director and Chief Financial Officer of Clear Channel, was a member of
CNETs Board of Directors and served as Chairman of the Audit Committee until his
resignation in June 2003. The agreement to license the San Francisco radio station from
Clear Channel was originally entered into when the station was owned by AM/FM, a company
that was eventually purchased by Clear Channel, and prior to Mr. Mays joining the CNET board. An affiliate of SOFTBANK Corp. has
entered into a three-year agreement under which the SOFTBANK affiliate paid CNET $20
million in exchange for an exclusive license to the ZDNet brand and content in Japan. In
addition, CNET and SOFTBANK Media, an affiliate of SOFTBANK Corp., are joint owners of a
company that is the licensee and operator of CNETs ZDNet brand and online content in
Korea. SOFTBANK Media owns a 303 percent minority interest in the Korean entity, and CNET
owns a 637 percent interest. Eric Hippeau, Managing Partner of SOFTBANK Capital Partners,
a venture fund and affiliate of SOFTBANK, was a member of CNETs Board of Directors
and served on the Compensation Committee until his resignation in December 2003. 14 QUARTERLY FINANCIAL

In the third quarter of 2002, CNET performed its annual goodwill and intangible
asset impairment test as of August 31, 2002. The results of this annual
impairment test indicated the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible
assets for the U.S. Media reporting unit exceeded their implied fair values, and
an impairment charge of $2388 million for goodwill and of $405 million for
intangible assets of that reporting unit was recorded in the third quarter of
2002. Additionally, a loss on disposal of fixed assets of $18 million and $94
million was recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2002, respectively.
