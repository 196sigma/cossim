We conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the Treadway Commission 2013 Framework.Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by Schneider Downs Co. Inc., an independent registered public accounting firm which also audited our consolidated financial statements.Schneider Downs attestation report on the consolidated financial statements and managements maintenance of effective internal control over financial reporting is included under the heading Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. s/Dennis M. Oates s/Ross C. Wilkin Dennis M. Oates Ross C. Wilkin Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Vice President of Finance, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer  24 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Universal Stainless Alloy Products, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Universal Stainless Alloy Products, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and shareholders equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015.In addition, our audit included the consolidated financial statement schedule listed in the index at  2 Schedule II.We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.The Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements, the consolidated financial statement Schedule II, and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the related consolidated financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the consolidated financial statements as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the information set forth therein.Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. s/Schneider Downs Co., Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Consolidation.The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Universal Stainless Alloy Products, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries collectively, we, us, our, or the Company.All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. We have no interests in any unconsolidated entity. Use of Estimates.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.The estimates and assumptions used in these consolidated financial statements are based on known information available as of the balance sheet date. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Concentration of Credit Risk.We limit our credit risk on accounts receivable by performing ongoing credit evaluations and, when deemed necessary, require letters of credit, guarantees or cash collateral.During 2015, we had one customer which accounted for more than 16% of our total net sales and for 7% of our total accounts receivable balance.During 2014, we had one customer that accounted for more than 18% of our total net sales and for 11% of our total accounts receivable balance.During 2013, we had two customers which each accounted for more than10%, and collectively for 26%, of our total net sales. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.Accounts receivable are presented net of the allowance for doubtful accounts on our consolidated balance sheets.We market our products to a diverse customer base, primarily throughout the United States.During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we derived 9%, 7% and 6%, respectively, of our net sales from markets outside of the United States.The allowance for doubtful accounts includes specific reserves for the value of outstanding invoices issued to customers that are deemed potentially not collectible.Receivables are charged-off to the allowance when they are deemed to be uncollectible.Bad debt expense, net of recoveries for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $239,000, $18,000 and $30,000, respectively. Inventories.Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost principally determined by the weighted average cost method. Such costs include the acquisition cost for raw materials and supplies, direct labor and applied manufacturing overhead within the guidelines of normal plant capacity.We reserve for slow-moving inventory and inventory that is being evaluated under our quality control process.The reserves are based upon managements expected method of disposition.The net change in inventory reserves for the year ended December 31, 2015, was a decrease of $136,000, primarily due to the disposition of slow moving material that was no longer considered sellable and was returned to our melt shop. The net change in inventory reserves for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was a $603,000 decrease and a $617,000 increase, respectively. Included in inventory are operating materials consisting of forge dies and production molds and rolls, that are consumed over their useful lives.During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we amortized these operating materials in the amount of $18 million, $16 million and $12 million, respectively.This expense is recorded as a component of cost of products sold on the consolidated statements of operations and included as a part of our total depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Property, Plant and Equipment.Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost or its fair value at acquisition date.Costs incurred in connection with the construction or major rebuild of facilities are capitalized as construction in progress.During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 we did not capitalize interest expense related to projects in process.We did capitalize $263,000 of interest expense related to construction projects in progress for the year ended December 31, 2013.No depreciation is recognized on assets until they are placed in service.Assets which have been retired or disposed of are removed from cost and accumulated depreciation accounts, with the gain or loss reflected in operating income on the consolidated statements of operations.Major equipment maintenance costs are capitalized as incurred and included in other current assets.These costs are amortized to cost of products sold within a twelve-month period.Other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.Costs of improvements and renewals are capitalized.Our maintenance expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $169 million, $165 million and $148 million, respectively, which is included as a component of cost of products sold. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets.The estimated useful lives of buildings and land improvements are between 10 and 39 years, and the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment are between 5 and 20 years.Our total depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $158 million, $150 million and $143 million, respectively, of which $154 million, $146 million and $141 million, respectively was included as a component of cost of products sold while the remainder was included in selling, general and administrative expense. Intangible Assets. At December 31, 2014 we had a $13 million non-compete agreement related to the acquisition of the North Jackson facility which is classified as an intangible asset.Identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value upon acquisition and are amortized over the life of the agreement using the straight-line method.We recognized $432,000, $266,000 and $266,000 of  30 amortization expense during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, from intangible assets, which is included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and included as part of total depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statements of cash flows.The 2015 expense of $432,000 includes $255,000 for the early exit of a non-compete contract. At December 31, 2015 our intangible assets were fully amortized. Long-Lived Asset Impairment.Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in relation to the operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying assets. Adjustments are made if the sum of expected future cash flows is less than the book value.Based on managements assessment of the carrying values of long-lived assets, no impairment reserve was deemed necessary as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Deferred Financing Costs. Deferred financing costs are amortized up to the maturity date of the related financial instrument using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method.Deferred financing cost amortization for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $566,000, $644,000 and $444,000, respectively, and is included as a component of interest expense and other financing costs on the consolidated statements of operations and included as part of total depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statements of cash flows.At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $13 million and $14 million, respectively, of unamortized deferred financing costs included on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other long-term assets. Goodwill. Goodwill, which represents the excess of cost over net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses, is stated at fair value.Goodwill is not amortized, but will be evaluated or tested annually for impairment or more frequently if any event indicates that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. We perform our annual evaluation or test of goodwill as of the beginning of the fourth quarter.We evaluate or test goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two-step quantitative test, which involves comparing the estimated fair value of the associated reporting unit to its carrying value.The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that fair value is less than its carrying amount.Factors considered as part of the qualitative assessment include entity-specific, industry, market and general economic conditions.We may elect to bypass this qualitative assessment and perform a two-step quantitative test.We test for goodwill impairment using a combination of valuation techniques, which include consideration of a market-based approach guideline company method and an income approach discounted cash flow method, in determining fair value in the annual impairment test of goodwill.We believe that the combination of the valuation models provides a more appropriate valuation by taking into account different marketplace participant assumptions.Both methods utilize market data in the derivation of a value estimate and are forward-looking in nature.The guideline assessment of future performance and the discounted cash flow method utilize a market-derived rate of return to discount anticipated performance. Other events and changes in circumstances may also require goodwill to be tested for impairment between annual measurement dates.While a decline in stock price and market capitalization is not specifically cited as a goodwill impairment indicator, a companys stock price and market capitalization should be considered in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less that its carrying value.Additionally, a significant decline in a companys stock price may suggest that an adverse change in the business climate may have caused the fair value of the reporting unit to fall below its carrying value. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization.During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short-term swing or a longer-term trend.A sustained decline in our market capitalization below its book value could lead us to determine, in a future period, that an interim goodwill impairment review is required and may result in an impairment charge which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. We recorded a goodwill impairment in the third quarter of 2015.Due to a significant and sustained drop in our share price and continued weak operating results driven by slower market conditions, the Company determined that an interim goodwill impairment review was required in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. Based on the guidance in ASC 350, the Company performed the two-step quantitative analysis.Under the first step, the Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the Company and, therefore, the second step of the analysis was performed.The fair value was estimated using a combination of an income approach, which estimates fair value based on projected discounted cash flows and a market approach, which estimates fair value using the recent stock price of the Company.The income approach is supported by a Level 3 fair value measurement, which means that the valuation reflects the Companys own estimates of market participant assumptions.The market approach is supported by a Level 1 fair value measurement which is the observable stock price of the Company.The income approach was weighted 30% and the market approach was weighted 70% in determining the fair value. This assessment resulted in the recognition of a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $203 million, which eliminated all goodwill from the balance sheet at September 30, 2015. Stockholders Equity. We have never paid a cash dividend on our common stock.Our Credit Agreement does not permit the payment of cash dividends.  31 In October 1998, we initiated a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 315,000 shares of our outstanding common stock in open market transactions at market prices. We were authorized to repurchase 45,100 remaining shares of common stock under this program as of December 31, 2015. Revenue Recognition.Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when both risk of loss and title have transferred to the customer, which in most cases coincides with shipment of the related products, and collection is reasonably assured.Revenue from conversion services is recognized when the performance of the service is complete.Invoiced shipping and handling costs are also accounted for as revenue. Customer claims, which are not material, are accounted for primarily as a reduction to gross sales after the matter has been researched and an acceptable resolution has been reached. The following table presents net sales by product line For the years ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 dollars in thousands Stainless steel 135,945 159,799 137,383 High-strength low alloy steel 16,045 16,853 17,894 Tool steel 16,197 16,680 18,112 High-temperature alloy steel 7,557 6,295 4,277 Conversion services and other sales 4,916 5,933 3,102 Total net sales 180,660 205,560 180,768 Income Taxes.Deferred income taxes are provided for unused tax credits earned and the tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements.We use the liability method to account for income taxes, which requires deferred taxes to be recorded at the statutory rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid.Valuation allowances are provided for a deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. Income tax penalties and interest are included in the provision for income tax expense. We evaluate the tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns. A tax position should only be recognized in the financial statements if we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities, based upon the technical merits of the position.For those tax positions that should be recognized, the measurement of a tax position is determined as being the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.We believe there are no material uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. We use the with-and-without method to account for excess tax benefits recognized as a result of the exercise of employee stock options.Under the with-and-without method, excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us, which are also subject to applicable limitations. Share-based Compensation Plans.We recognize compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value of the awards.The fair value of the stock option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and is recognized ratably over the service/vesting period of the award.The fair value of time-based restricted stock grants is calculated using the market value of the stock on the date of issuance, and is recognized ratably over the service/vesting period of the award. Net Loss Income per Common Share.Net loss income per common share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income, adjusted to include interest expense tax effected for the convertible notes by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.All shares that were issuable under our outstanding convertible notes were considered outstanding for our diluted net income per common share computation, using the if converted method of accounting from the date of issuance. Statement of Comprehensive Income. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no comprehensive income items other than net income loss; therefore, a separate consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income was excluded from the consolidated financial statements. Treasury Stock. We account for treasury stock under the cost method and include such shares as a reduction of total stockholders equity.  32 Financial Instruments. Financial instruments held by us include cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and long-term debt.The carrying value of cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable is considered to be representative of fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.Refer to Note 5 for fair value disclosures of our financial instruments. Segment Reporting. Our operating facilities are integrated, and therefore our chief operating decision maker CODM views the Company as one business unit.Our CODM sets performance goals, assesses performance and makes decisions about resource allocations on a consolidated basis.As a result of these factors, as well as the nature of the financial information available which is reviewed by our CODM, we maintain one reportable segment. Reclassifications. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2015 presentation. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes Topic 740:Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.We adopted ASU 2015-17 in 2015. The update resulted in the classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncement In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 which was amended, in August 2015, by ASU 2015-14 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606: Deferral of the Effective Date. This topic converges the guidance within U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards and supersedes Accounting Standards Codification 605, Revenue Recognition.The new standard requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.The new standard will also result in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provide guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively, and improve guidance for multiple-element arrangements.The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.We are currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory ASU 2015-11 to simplify the guidance on the subsequent measurement of inventory, excluding inventory measured using last-in, first out or the retail inventory method. Under the new standard, inventory should be at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2015-11 on the Company consolidated financial statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, and early application is permitted.We are currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.  33 Note 2: Inventory The major classes of inventory are as follows: December 31 2015 2014 dollars in thousands Raw materials and starting stock 6,235 8,943 Semi-finished and finished steel products 69,907 84,816 Operating materials 8,543 8,759 Gross inventory 84,685 102,518 Inventory reserves 1,312 1,448 Total inventory, net 83,373 101,070 Note 3: Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment consists of the following: December 31 2015 2014 dollars in thousands Land and land improvements 7,377 7,088 Buildings 47,712 45,434 Machinery and equipment 236,991 225,754 Construction in progress 8,580 12,833 Gross property, plant and equipment 300,660 291,109 Accumulated depreciation 107,155 91,314 Property, plant and equipment, net 193,505 199,795 Note 4: Long-Term Debt Long-term debt consists of the following: December 31 2015 2014 dollars in thousands Term loan 12,500 15,500 Revolving credit facility 44,350 51,350 Convertible notes 20,000 20,000 Swing loan credit facility 287 25 77,137 86,875 Less: current portion of long-term debt 3,000 3,000 Long-term debt 74,137 83,875  34 Credit Facility At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had a Credit Agreement as previously amended, Prior Credit Agreement with a syndication of banks which provided for a $1050 million senior secured revolving credit facility the Prior Revolver and a $200 million senior secured term loan facility the Prior Term Loan and together with the Prior Revolver, the Prior Facilities with an expiration in March 2017. The Prior Credit Agreement required us to pay a commitment fee of 025% based on the daily unused portion of the Prior Revolver. The Prior Revolver also provided for up to $70 million of swing loans so long as the sum of the outstanding swing loans and the outstanding borrowings under the Prior Revolver did not exceed our borrowing base under the terms of the Prior Credit Agreement. The Prior Term Loan was payable in quarterly installments in the principal amount of $750,000 which began on July1, 2013, with the balance of the Term Loan payable in full on March19, 2017. Amounts outstanding under the Prior Facilities, at our option, incurred interest at either a base rate or a LIBOR-based rate the LIBOR Option, in either case calculated in accordance with the terms of the Prior Credit Agreement.We elected to use the LIBOR Option during the year ended December 31, 2015, which was 218% at December 31, 2015. Interest on the Prior Facilities was payable monthly.Amounts outstanding under the Prior Facilities were collateralized by the Companys accounts receivable, inventory and property, plant and equipment. On October 23, 2015, the Company entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Prior Credit Agreement the Fourth Amendment which was effective as of September 30, 2015.Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, the covenants required under the Prior Credit Agreement were amended. We were in compliance with our covenants at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. On January 21, 2016 we entered into a new Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement the Credit Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and co-collateral agent, Bank of America, N.A., as co-collateral agent and PNC Capital Markets LLC, as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner.The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility not to exceed $65 million the Revolving Credit Facility and a senior secured term loan facility the Term Loan in the amount of $30 million together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Facilities.The Credit Agreement also provides for a letter of credit sub-facility not to exceed $100 million and a swing loan sub-facility not to exceed $50 million.The Credit Agreement replaces the Prior Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with all applicable financial covenants set forth in the Prior Credit Agreement as of the date of its entrance into the Credit Agreement. The Facilities, which expire upon the earlier of iJanuary21, 2021 or iithe date that is 90 days prior to the scheduled maturity date of the Convertible Notes as defined below in either case, the Expiration Date, are collateralized by a first lien in substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, except that no real property is collateral under the Facilities other than the Companys real property in North Jackson, Ohio. Availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory.The Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 025% based on the daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. With respect to the Term Loan, the Company will pay quarterly installments of principal of approximately $11 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on the first day of each fiscal quarter beginning on April1, 2016. To the extent not previously paid, the Term Loan will become due and payable in full on the Expiration Date. Amounts outstanding under the Facilities, at the Companys option, will bear interest at either a base rate or a LIBOR based rate, in either case calculated in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.Interest under the Credit Agreement is payable monthly. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants.The Company also must maintain certain levels of EBITDA as outlined in the Credit Agreement.As of December31, 2016 and as of the end of each fiscal quarter ending thereafter, the Company must maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 110 to 10, in each case measured on a rolling four-quarter basis calculated in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2015 we had deferred financing fees of approximately $13 million.As a result of entering into the Credit Agreement we expect to write off approximately $08 million of deferred fees in the first quarter of 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company completed the issuance of 73,207 shares of the Companys common stock to certain directors and officers of the Company on February 2, 2016.The aggregate purchase price of the stock was $500,00381 based on the average of the high and low reported trading prices for the Companys common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market on February 1, 2016.  35 Convertible Notes In connection with the acquisition of the North Jackson facility, in August 2011, we issued $200 million in convertible notes the Notes to the sellers of the North Jackson facility as partial consideration of the acquisition.The Notes were subordinated obligations and ranked junior to the Prior Facilities.The Notes bore interest at a fixed rate of 40% per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on each June 18 and December 18, beginning on December 18, 2011. As of December 31, 2015, unless earlier converted, the Notes were scheduled to mature and the unpaid principal balance was due on August 17, 2017.The Notes and any accrued and unpaid interest were convertible into shares of our common stock at the option of the holder at an initial conversion price of $471675 per share of common stock.The conversion price associated with the Notes was subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.We were permittedto prepay any outstanding Notes, in whole or in part, during a fiscal quarter if our share price was greater than 140% of the then-current conversion price for at least 20 of the trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding quarter. On January21, 2016, the Company entered into Amended and Restated Convertible Notes collectively, the Convertible Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $200 million, each in favor of Gorbert Inc. the Holder. The Convertible Notes amended and restated the Notes. The Companys obligations under the Convertible Notes are collateralized by a second lien on the same assets of the Co-Borrowers that collateralize the obligations of the Co-Borrowers under the Facilities. The Convertible Notes mature on March 17, 2019 and the maturity date may be extended, at the Companys option, to March 17, 2020 and further to March 17, 2021. If the Company elects to extend the maturity date of the Convertible Notes to March 17, 2020, principal payments in the aggregate of $20 million will be required on March 17, 2019.If the Company elects to extend the maturity date of the Convertible Notes further to March 17, 2021, principal payments in the aggregate of $20 million will be required on March 17, 2020. The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 40%per year through and including August17, 2016, a rate of 50%per year from August18, 2016 through and including August17, 2017 and a rate of 60%per year from and after August18, 2017.Through and including June18, 2017, all accrued and unpaid interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June18 and December18. After June18, 2017, all accrued and unpaid interest is payable quarterly in arrears on each  and June18. The Holder may elect at any time on or prior to August17, 2017 to convert all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Notes which is an integral multiple of $100,000. The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of common stock and, in certain circumstances, cash, securities and/or other assets. The Convertible Notes are convertible based on an initial conversion rate of 212 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of $471675 per share. The conversion rate and the conversion price associated with the Convertible Notes may be adjusted in certain circumstances. The Holders conversion rights will be void and no longer subject to exercise by the Holder beginning on August17, 2017. In conjunction with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we made principal prepayments on the Convertible Notes totaling $10 million on January 21, 2016. The aggregate annual principal payments due under our Prior Credit Agreement at December 31, 2015, are as follows: dollars in thousands 2016 3,000 2017 74,137 77,137  36 Note 5: Fair Value Measurements The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the inputs used to determine fair value, which are as follows: Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Level 2 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize managements estimates of market participant assumptions. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The carrying amounts of our cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated fair value at December 31, 2015 and 2014 due to their short-term nature Level 1.The fair value of the Term Loan, Revolver and swing loans at December 31, 2015 and 2014 approximated the carrying amount as the interest rate is based upon floating short-term interest rates Level 2.At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of our Notes was approximately $192 million and $205 million, respectively Level 2. Note 6: Income Taxes The income tax provision benefit attributable to continuing operations during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is as follows: Components of the provision benefit for income taxes are as follows: For the years ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 dollars in thousands Current benefit provision Federal 105 312 85 State 56 298 6 Deferred benefit provision Federal 11,843 1,941 3,205 State 252 598 622 Benefit provision for income taxes 12,144 3,149 2,504 A reconciliation of the federal statutory tax rate and our effective tax rate is as follows: For the years ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 Federal statutory tax rate 350 350 350 Research and development tax credit 16 29 146 State government grants, net of federal tax impact   42 Valuation allowance, state government grants, net of federal impact  82 150 Domestic manufacturing deduction    State income taxes, net of federal impact 06 37 14 Other, net 02 03 21 Effective income tax rate 370 437 381  37 We continue to record a full valuation allowance against our New York deferred tax assets due to the zero percent 0% state income tax rate for qualified manufacturers.We have determined that federal and other state deferred tax assets are expected to be realized and have not recorded any additional valuation allowances. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 extended the tax benefit for research and development tax credits resulting in a benefit of approximately $430,000, which was recorded entirely in the fourth quarter of 2015. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.Significant components of our net deferred taxes related to continuing operations are as follows December 31 2015 2014 dollars in thousands Noncurrent deferred income taxes Federal and state tax carryforwards 22,495 17,495 Inventory 1,196 3,136 Share-based compensation 3,545 3,300 Receivables 76 29 Accrued liabilities 299 396 Other 65 65 Total deferred tax assets 27,676 24,421 Deferred tax liabilities Property, plant and equipment 47,899 56,354 Other 443 492 Total deferred tax liabilities 48,342 56,846 Total noncurrent deferred income taxes 20,666 32,425 We file a U.S. federal income tax return and various state income tax returns.For federal income tax purposes, we had $542 million and $415 million of net operating loss carryforwards at December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively. The net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2031.In addition, we have credit carryforwards associated with our research and development activities of $23 million and $17 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively.The research and development credit carryforwards being to expire in 2030.We also have $489,000 and $597,000 in alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively.The alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely. We have state net operating loss carryforwards of $90 million and $81 million and state credit carryforwards of $265,000 and $267,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively.The state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2031. The state credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2027. We are routinely under audit by federal or state authorities. Our federal tax returns are subject to examination by the IRS for tax years after 2011.We are subject to examination by state tax jurisdictions for tax years after 2011.  38 Note 7: Net Loss Income Per Common Share The computation of basic and diluted net loss income per common share for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is as follows: For the years ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 dollars in thousands, except per share amounts Numerator Net loss income 20,672 4,050 4,062 Adjustment for interest expense on convertible notes    Net loss income, as adjusted 20,672 4,050 4,062 Denominator Weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding 7,069,954 7,031,539 6,950,976 Weighted average effect of dilutive stock options and other stock compensation  84,892  Weighted average effect of assumed conversion of convertible notes    Weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, as adjusted 7,069,954 7,116,431 6,950,976 Net loss income per common share Basic 292 058 058 Diluted 292 057 058 An adjustment for interest expense on convertible notes was excluded from the income per share calculation for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 as a result of the convertible notes being antidilutive. There were635,200,440,300 and 353,550options to purchase shares of common stock, at an average price of $3067, $3520 and $3636for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively that were not included in the computation of diluted net loss income per common share because their respective exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common stock. The calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 excludes 428,140 shares, for the assumed conversion of convertible notes as a result of the convertible notes being antidilutive. In addition, the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December31, 2015 and 2013 would have included 21,774 and 118,814 respectively, for the assumed exercise of options and restricted stock under our share incentive plans except that we were in a net loss position and the impact would have been antidilutive.  39 Note 8: Incentive Compensation Plans At December 31, 2015, we had three incentive compensation plans that are described below: Omnibus Incentive Plan We maintain an Omnibus Incentive Plan OIP which was approved by our stockholders in May 2012.The OIP permits the issuance of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards to non-employee directors, other than those directors owning more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, consultants, officers and other key employees who are expected to contribute to our future growth and success.An aggregate of 2,150,000 shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the OIP, of which 363,993 were available for grant at December 31, 2015. Stock Options The option price for options granted under the OIP is equal to the fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant.Options granted to non-employee directors vest over a three-year period, and options granted to employees vest over a four-year period.All options under the OIP will expire no later than ten years after the grant date.Forfeited options may be reissued and are included in the amount available for grants. A summary of stock option activity as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 is presented below: Non-vested stock Stock options options outstanding outstanding Weighted Weighted Weighted average average average Number grant-date Number exercise contractual of shares fair value of shares price term years Outstanding at December 31, 2014 235,844 1634 775,675 2912 Stock options granted 192,400 699 192,400 1302 Stock options exercised   17,500 1527 Stock options vested 59,469 1745   Stock options forfeited 69,575 1500 108,825 2919 Outstanding at December 31, 2015 299,200 1040 841,750 2571 52 Exercisable at December 31, 2015 542,550 2984 46 Proceeds from stock option exercises totaled $267,000, $764,000 and $848,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Shares issued in connection with stock option exercises are issued from available authorized shares. Based upon the closing stock price of $929 at December 31, 2015, there was nointrinsic value of outstanding and exercisable stock options.Intrinsic value of stock options is calculated as the amount by which the market price of our common stock exceeds the exercise price of the options.The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $129,000, $841,000 and $929,000, respectively.The total fair value of stock option awards vested during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $10 million, $17 million and $14 million, respectively. Share-based compensation to employees and directors is recognized as compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations based on the stock options fair value on the measurement date, which is the date of the grant.The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods.The compensation expense recognized and its related tax effects are included in additional paid-in capital. Share-based compensation expense related to stock options totaled $15 million, $17 million and $15 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Share-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period for all stock option awards.Unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock option awards totaled $27 million at December 31, 2015.At such date, the weighted-average period over which this unrecognized expense was expected to be recognized was 30 years.We recognized no tax benefit for the exercise of stock options during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.  40 The fair value of our stock options granted is estimated on the measurement date, which is the date of grant.We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.Our determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected stock option exercise behaviors.The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $699, $1439 and $1802, respectively. The assumptions used to determine the fair value of stock options granted are detailed in the table below: 2015 2014 2013 Risk-free interest rate 177% to 219 179%to 213 102%to 214 Dividend yield 00 00 00 Expected market price volatility 49% to 55 49% to 57 57% to 60 Weighted-average expected market price volatility 526 526 581 Expected term 56 to 75 years 56to75 years 54to75 years The risk-free interest rate was developed using the U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods equal to the expected life of the stock options at the grant date.No dividend yield was assumed because we do not pay cash dividends on common stock and currently have no plans to pay a dividend.Expected volatility is based on the long-term historical volatility estimated over a period equal to the expected term of the stock options of our common stock. In estimating the fair value of stock options under the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately.The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Restricted Stock During the year ended December 31, 2012, we granted 35,000 time-based shares of restricted common stock to certain employees.The fair value of the non-vested time-based restricted common stock awards was calculated using the market value of the stock on the date of issuance, which was $3526.During the year ended December 31, 2013, 3,000 of these restricted shares were forfeited. Share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock totaled $412,000, $342,000 and $339,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.As of December 31, 2015, all of the restricted shares have vested. Employee Stock Purchase Plan Under the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended the Plan, the Company is authorized to issue up to 200,000 shares of common stock to its full-time employees, nearly all of whom are eligible to participate.Under the terms of the Plan, employees can choose as of January1 and July1 of each year to have up to 10% of their total earnings withheld to purchase up to 100 shares of our common stock each six-month period. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of its beginning-of-the-period or end-of-the-period market prices.At December 31, 2015, we have issued 178,636 shares of common stock since the Plans inception. Cash Incentive Plans We have a variable compensation plan covering certain key executives and senior management and profit-sharing plans and a key performance plan that cover the remaining employees.The variable compensation plan aligns the compensation of executive officers and senior management with the performance expectations of the Board of Directors in order to motivate and reward them for the achievement of Company performance metrics.The profit-sharing plans provide for the sharing of pre-tax profits in excess of specified amounts at our Bridgeville, Dunkirk and Titusville facilities.The key performance plan provides a cash incentive for achieving certain performance metrics at our North Jackson facility.For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we expensed $10 million, $44 million and $10 million, respectively, under these cash incentive plans of which $404,000, $18 million, and $576,000, respectively was included as a component of cost of products sold while the remainder was included in selling and administrative expense.At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had liabilities of $608,000 and $33 million, respectively, as a component of accrued employment costs on our consolidated balance sheets related to these cash incentive plans. Note 9: Retirement Plans We have a defined contribution retirement plan 401k plan that covers substantially all employees. Pursuant to the 401k plan, participants may elect to make pre-tax and after-tax contributions, subject to certain limitations imposed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.In addition, we make periodic contributions to the 401k plan based on service for the Titusville and Dunkirk hourly employees and age for North Jackson hourly employees.We make periodic contributions for the salaried employees at all locations except for North Jackson based upon their service and their individual contribution to the 401k plan.For North Jackson salaried employees, we make periodic contributions based upon the employees age and their individual contributions.  41 We also participate in the Steelworkers Pension Trust the Trust, a multi-employer defined-benefit pension plan that is open to all hourly and salary employees associated with the Bridgeville facility.We make periodic contributions to the Trust based on hours worked at a fixed rate for each hourly employee, as determined by the collective bargaining agreement, which expires in August 2018 and a fixed monthly contribution on behalf of each salary employee.The trustees of the Trust have provided us with the latest data available for the Trust year ending December 31, 2015.As of that date, the Trust is not fully funded.We could be held liable to the Trust for our own obligations, as well as those of other employers, due to our participation in the Trust. Contribution rates could increase if the Trust is required to adopt a funding improvement plan or a rehabilitation plan, if the performance of the Trust assets do not meet expectations, or as a result of future collectively-bargained wage and benefit agreements.If we choose to stop participating in the Trust, we may be required to pay the Trust an amount based on the underfunded status of the Trust, referred to as a withdrawal liability. The Pension Protection Act PPA defines a zone status for each trust.Trusts in the green zone are at least 80% funded, trusts in the yellow zone are at least 65% funded, and trusts in the red zone are generally less than 65% funded.The Trust has utilized extended amortization provisions to amortize its losses from 2008.The Trust recertified its zone status after using the extended amortization provisions as allowed by law.The Trust has not implemented a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, nor are such plans pending.Our contributions to the Trust have not exceeded more than 5% of the total contributions to the Trust.
