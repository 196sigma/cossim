CURAGEN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
OrganizationCuraGen Corporation the Company or CuraGen is a genomics based pharmaceutical development company that applies integrated
functional genomic technologies and Internet-based bioinformatic systems to discover and develop pharmaceutical products to treat large unmet medical needs. Through the application of their proprietary technologies, the Company is gaining an
understanding of how genes and proteins function in the context of disease, and are applying this knowledge to the development of protein, antibody, and small molecule therapeutics. The Company was incorporated in November 1991 and, until March
1993, was engaged primarily in organizational activities, research and development of the Companys technology, grant preparation and obtaining financing. In June 2000, the Company formed 454 Corporation 454, a majority-owned
subsidiary.  The 1999 and 2000 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the classification
used in 2001. All dollar amounts are shown in thousands, except per share data.  Principles of ConsolidationThe
consolidated financial statements include CuraGen and 454, its majority-owned subsidiary. All material intercompany accounts, transactions, and profits have been eliminated in consolidation.  Revenue RecognitionThe Company has entered into certain collaborative research agreements that provide for the partial or complete funding
of specified projects in exchange for access to, and certain rights in, the data discovered under the related projects. Revenue is recognized based upon work performed or upon the attainment of certain benchmarks or milestones specified in the
related agreements. The Company has also entered into a collaborative research exchange agreement in which services and technology access are exchanged between the collaborative partners. Revenues and expenses under this exchange arrangement are
based upon the fair value of the work performed by each collaborative partner. Revenues were $167, $2,371 and $5,384 and expenses were $292, $3,871 and $6,884 under the collaborative research exchange agreement for the years ended December 31, 1999,
2000 and 2001, respectively. Deferred revenue arising from payments received from collaborative agreements is recognized as income when earned. Grant revenue is recognized as related costs qualifying under the terms of the grants are incurred. Grant
revenue is derived solely from federal and Connecticut agencies see Note 7.  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term
InvestmentsThe Company considers investments readily convertible into cash with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are
considered short-term investments. The carrying amount of the investments approximates fair value due to their short maturity.  Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Equipment under capital leases is recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments required over the term of the lease or the fair
value of the assets at the inception of the lease. Additions, renewals and betterments that significantly extend the life of an asset are capitalized. Minor replacements, maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Equipment is
depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from three to seven years, using the straight-line method. Equipment under capital leases is amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the terms of the
lease, using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life or the term of the lease, using the straight-line method. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, land is not required to be depreciated. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in
income.  Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsThe Company regularly evaluates the recoverability of the net carrying
value of its property, and intangible assets, when an indicator of impairment is present by comparing the carrying values to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. A deficiency in these cash flows relative to the carrying
25  
CURAGEN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
amounts is an indication of the need for a write-down due to impairment. The impairment write-down would be the difference between the carrying amounts and the fair value of these assets as
determined by using estimated future undiscounted cash flows. A loss on impairment would be recognized by a charge to earnings.  Deferred Real Estate CostsDeferred real estate costs were paid in 1997 in connection with the original signing of the operating lease in New Haven, Connecticut see Note 3. These costs, which are included in Intangible assets,
net, are amortized over the remaining life of the lease as of the date of occupancy, 69 months, using the straight-line method. Accumulated amortization aggregated $33, $45 and $57, respectively, as of December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001. Related
amortization expense was $12 for each of the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001. Additionally, deferred real estate costs were paid during 2001 in connection with the proposed company construction of a new facility in Branford,
Connecticut. These costs, which are currently included in Intangible assets, net, will be capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the building as of the date of occupancy, currently anticipated to be during 2003. 
Licensing FeesLicensing fees for various research and development purposes were paid during 1999, 2000 and 2001. These costs,
which are included in Intangible assets, net, are amortized over the various lives of the licenses. Certain fully amortized licensing fees were written-off during 2000 and 2001. Accumulated amortization aggregated $128, $102 and $87, respectively,
as of December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001. Related amortization expense was $97, $429 and $94, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001.  Financing CostsFinancing costs related to the convertible subordinated debt see Note 8 were paid during 2000 and 2001. These costs, which are included in Intangible assets, net, are amortized over the
remaining life of the debt. Accumulated amortization aggregated $655 and $1,384, respectively, as of December 31, 2000 and 2001. Related amortization expense was $655 and $729, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001.
Patent Application CostsCosts incurred in filing for patents are charged to operations, until such time as it is
determined that the filing will be successful. When it becomes evident with reasonable certainty that an application will be successful, the costs incurred in filing for patents will begin to be capitalized. Capitalized costs related to successful
patent applications will be amortized over a period not to exceed twenty years or the remaining life of the patent, whichever is shorter, using the straight-line method. During 1999, 2000 and 2001, all patent application costs have been charged to
operations.  Research and Development CostsResearch and development costs are charged to operations as incurred.
Grant research expenses include all direct research and development costs incurred related to specific grant awards and programs. All remaining research and development costs are incurred for the development and maintenance of current and future
research collaboration agreements and accordingly, have been classified as collaborative research and development expenses.  Stock-Based CompensationIn October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS
123, which was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 1996. SFAS 123 requires expanded disclosures of stock-based compensation arrangements with employees and non-employees and encourages but does not require compensation cost to be
measured based on the fair value of the equity instruments awarded to employees. Companies are permitted to continue to apply Accounting Principles Board APB No. 25, which recognizes compensation cost based on the intrinsic value of
the equity instruments awarded. The Company will continue to apply APB No. 25 to its stock-based compensation awards to employees.  For equity instruments awarded to non-employees, the Company records the transactions based upon the consideration received for such awards or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. For
options issued to non-employees, the Company records the transactions based upon the
26  
CURAGEN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
difference between the option strike price and the estimated fair market value as of the date each option vests. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense attributable to
non-employees totaling $104, $591 and $656 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. For options issued to employees, the Company records the transactions based upon the difference between the option strike price and the
Companys closing stock price on the Nasdaq National Market as of the date of issuance. Stock-based compensation associated with options granted to employees during 1997 amounted to $1,673 and is being expensed by the Company over the vesting
period of the underlying options. During 1999, 2000 and 2001, no stock-based compensation in connection with options granted to employees was recorded as all options granted were issued at the Companys closing stock price on the Nasdaq
National Market as of the date of issuance. The Company recorded amortization, net of write-offs, of stock-based compensation expense for options issued to employees during 1997 of $261, $154 and $31 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and
2001, respectively. During 1999, 2000 and 2001, no stock-based compensation in connection with options granted to employees was recorded as all options granted were issued at the Companys closing stock price on the Nasdaq National Market as of
the date of issuance.  Income TaxesIncome taxes are provided for as required under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This Statement requires the use of the asset and liability method in determining the tax effect of the temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting amounts.  Loss Per ShareBasic loss per share LPS is
computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted LPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue Common Stock were exercised or converted
into Common Stock. Due to the loss from operations, warrants granted but not yet exercised, convertible subordinated debt, and stock options granted under the Companys stock option plans but not yet exercised are antidilutive and therefore not
considered for the diluted LPS calculations. Under the assumption that warrants, convertible subordinated debt and options were not antidilutive, the denominator for diluted loss per share would be 30,789,412, 42,638,848 and 50,680,170 at December
31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.  Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsStatement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments requires the disclosure of fair value information for certain assets and liabilities, whether or not recorded in the balance sheets, for which it is practical to
estimate that value. The Company has the following financial instruments: cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and certain other liabilities. The Company considers the carrying amount of
these items to approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. In addition, the Company also has convertible subordinated debt see Note 8.  Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ materially from those estimates.  SegmentsThe FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information SFAS 131 which establishes standards for reporting information on operating segments in interim and annual financial statements, and became
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. The Companys chief operating decision makers review the profit and loss of the Company on an aggregate basis and manage the operations of the Company as a single operating segment.
Accordingly, the Company had one reportable segment as of December 31, 2001.  Recently Enacted PronouncementsIn
June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133 which
27  
CURAGEN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. It requires companies
to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value. Accounting for changes in the values of those derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting. SFAS
133, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-Deferral of Effective Date of SFAS 133, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138,
Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activitites, became effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company has determined that the adoption of SFAS 133 will have no impact on its
consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into derivatives contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes.  In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations SFAS 141, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143. SFAS 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting
be used for all business combinations completed after June 30, 2001 and clarifies the criteria for recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill. The Company has determined that the adoption of SFAS 141 will have no impact on its
consolidated financial statements.  SFAS 142 requires that ratable amortization of goodwill be replaced with periodic tests of

Preferred Stock  During 1996 and 1997, the Company received aggregate consideration of $1,750 from five investors as subscriptions for the purchase of 350,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. In
September 1996, October 1996 and January 1997, the Company received proceeds of $1,600, $50 and $100, respectively. The Series B Preferred Stock was non-convertible and accrued dividends at the prime rate. Dividends were payable when declared by the
Board of Directors. Upon completing a qualified equity financing, as defined in the Series B Preferred Stock Agreement, the Company was entitled to redeem all of the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock. The completion of the Companys
initial public offering satisfied such requirement, and accordingly, in March 1998, the Company redeemed all of such Series B Preferred Stock for an aggregate redemption price of $1,968, including accrued dividends and dividends in arrears in the
amount of $218. In addition, upon issuance, holders of the Series B Preferred Stock received five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 716,722 shares of Common Stock at $293 per share. Such warrants were valued at $376. The value of such
warrants was accreted over the warrant period and such accretion was classified as preferred dividends. All of these warrants were exercised during 2000.  In June 2000, the Company launched 454, which sold 8,000,000 shares of 454 Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to Soros Fund Management, L.L.C. and Cooper Hill Partners, L.L.C. and members of the Companys
senior management team and related parties for an aggregate purchase price of $20,000. In order to complete the funding of 454 and in exchange for 12,000,000 shares of 454 Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company contributed $20,000 in cash

The deferred income tax assets are primarily a result of the federal and
Connecticut net operating loss carryforwards, research and development credit carryforwards, expenses related to option exercises and timing differences relating to depreciation and amortization. As the Company has no prior earnings history, a
valuation allowance has been established due to the Companys uncertainty in its ability to benefit from the federal and Connecticut net operating loss carryforwards. The increase in the valuation allowance was $14,800, $35,950 and $22,189 for
the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.  At December 31, 2001, CuraGen had federal and Connecticut net
operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of $182,874 and $173,015, respectively. Federal net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2008, and Connecticut net operating loss carryforwards began expiring in 1998. The Company also
had federal and Connecticut research and development tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes of $7,209 and $6,202, respectively, at December 31, 2001.  At December 31, 2001, 454 had federal and Connecticut net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of $4,289 and $4,037, respectively. Federal net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2016, and
Connecticut net operating loss carryforwards begin expiring in 2021. 454 also had federal and Connecticut research and development tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes of $196 and $0, respectively, at December 31, 2001.

For the year ended December 31, 2001, an income tax benefit of $3,550 was recorded
as a result of Connecticut legislation, which allows companies to obtain cash refunds from the State of Connecticut at a rate of 65% of their annual incremental research and development expense credit, in exchange for foregoing carryforward of the
research and development credit.  For income tax purposes, the Company and 454 do not file consolidated income tax returns.
7.Grants  The Company received federal grants during 1999 and earlier years, for specific purposes that are subject to review and audit by the grantor agencies. Such audits could lead to requests for reimbursement by the grantor agency for any
expenditures disallowed under the terms of the grant. Additionally, any noncompliance with the terms of the grant could lead to loss of current or future awards.  During 1995, the Company received two grants from Connecticut Innovations, Inc. CII in the amounts of $450 and $238. The term of the $450 grant is January 4, 1995 to
December 31, 2004, and the term of the $238 grant is February 1, 1995 to January 31, 2005. The Company could be required to repay 100% of these amounts if during the terms of the respective grants i the Company breaches and fails to cure a
material covenant, ii a material representation or warranty of the Company becomes untrue and is not cured, iii the Company becomes bankrupt or insolvent or liquidates its assets, or iv the Company is required to repay the federal grants to
which the CII grants relate. In addition, the Company could be required to repay up to 200% of the amounts of the CII grants if the Company ceases to have a Connecticut presence, during the terms of the respective grants. 
8.Convertible Subordinated Debt  During February 2000, the Company completed an offering for $125,000 of 6% convertible subordinated debentures due 2007 and received net proceeds of approximately $121,250. In addition, also in February 2000, the
initial purchasers exercised their option to purchase an additional $25,000 of 6% convertible subordinated debentures due 2007, providing the Company with additional net proceeds of approximately $24,308. Related interest expense for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 2001 was $8,192 and $9,000, respectively.  The debentures may be resold by the initial purchasers to
qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States under Regulation S under the Securities Act. The debentures are convertible into the Companys Common Stock at any time prior
to their maturity at a conversion price of $638275 per share. In addition, prior to February 2, 2003, if the Companys Common Stock price reaches specified levels, it has the right to redeem the debentures at a premium by converting the
debentures into Common Stock. The market value of the debentures based on quoted market prices, was estimated at $114,000 on December 31, 2001.  9.Minority Interest in Subsidiary  In June 2000, the Company launched 454, a 60% owned
subsidiary established to develop novel technologies for rapidly and comprehensively analyzing entire genomes. The Company agreed to sell to Soros Fund Management, L.L.C., and Cooper Hill Partners, L.L.C. five-year warrants to purchase 937,500
shares of its Common Stock at $32375 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $12,500. Simultaneously, 454 sold 8,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to Soros Fund Management and Cooper Hill Partners and members of the Companys
senior management team and related parties for an aggregate purchase price of $20,000.  In order to complete the funding of 454
and in exchange for 12,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the Company contributed $20,000 in cash and certain technologies for conducting genomic analyses. As a result

of this contribution of technology to 454, the Company recognized a gain of $3,929 recorded in additional paid-in-capital.  10.Subsequent Event  On March 27, 2002, the Board of Directors of
the Company adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of the Companys common stock. Each right will entitle registered holders of the Companys
common stock to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of a new series of junior participating preferred stock, designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. The rights generally will be exercisable only if a person which
term includes an entity or group i acquires 20 percent or more of the Companys common stock or ii announces a tender offer, the consummation of which would result in ownership by that person, entity or group of 20 percent or more of the
common stock. Once exercisable, the stockholder rights plan allows the Companys stockholders other than the acquiror to purchase common stock of the Company or of the acquiror at a substantial discount.  11.Summary Selected Quarterly Financial Data Unaudited

audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and

provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of CuraGen Corporation and its subsidiary at December 31, 2000 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in
