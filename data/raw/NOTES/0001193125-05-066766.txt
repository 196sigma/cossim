REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  The Board of Directors and Stockholders MetaSolv, Inc.:  We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MetaSolv, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MetaSolv, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of MetaSolv, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated March 28, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of, and an adverse opinion on the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.  Dallas, Texas March 28, 2005

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002  1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  MetaSolv, Inc. the Company, a Delaware corporation
headquartered in Plano, Texas, is a provider of software designed to automate the management of communications networks. Communications service providers using our software are able to efficiently enter, manage and fulfill orders for service from
their customers. These communications service providers offer a full array of communications services including local and long distance telephone services, high-speed data services and Internet services, often as a bundled offering. The Company
derives substantially all of its revenue from the sale of licenses, related professional services, maintenance and support of packaged software products to communications service providers.  aPrinciples of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of
MetaSolv, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  bRevenue Recognition  The Companys software products are licensed to customers through a direct sales force and indirect sales channels. The Companys software
licensing arrangements typically include multiple elements, such as software products, post-contract customer support, consulting, and training. The Company recognizes revenue using the residual method when there is vendor-specific
objective evidence of the fair values of all undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement that is not accounted for using long-term contract accounting. Under the residual method, the arrangement fee is recognized as follows: 1 the total
fair value of the undelivered elements, as indicated by vendor-specific objective evidence, is deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with the relevant sections of Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, and 2 the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements. Fees allocated to each software element of the arrangement are
recognized as revenue when the following criteria have been met: a a written contract for the license of software has been executed, b the product has been delivered to the customer, c the license fee is fixed or determinable, and d
collectibility of the resulting receivable is deemed probable. If evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements of the arrangement does not exist, all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does
exist, or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered. Fees allocated to post-contract customer support are recognized as revenue ratably over the support period. Fees allocated to other services are recognized as revenue as the service is
performed.  The Company is frequently engaged to provide
consulting and implementation services in connection with the licensing of its software. In situations where such services include significant modification or customization of the software or are otherwise essential to the functionality of the
software, revenues relating to the software license and services are aggregated and the combined revenues are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. Revenue earned using the percentage-of-completion method is based on
managements estimate of progress towards completion. Changes to estimates of progress towards completion, if any, are accounted for as a change in estimate in the period of the change. Of total deferred revenues, approximately $1,292,000 and
$1,246,000 as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, represented billings in excess of costs and related profits on certain contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method. Of unbilled receivables, approximately $501,000 and
$568,000 as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, represented costs and related profits in excess of billings on contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method.  Accounts receivable include only those amounts due from customers for which revenue has been recognized. Deferred revenue
includes amounts received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized.

cCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash  Cash equivalents consist of investments in an interest-bearing money market
account and commercial paper with maturities of three months or less. For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be
cash equivalents.  dMarketable Securities
and Equity Investments  Marketable securities at
December 31, 2004 and 2003 consist of commercial paper, U.S. government agency obligations, corporate bonds and municipal bonds. The Company classifies all of its marketable securities as available-for-sale. All such investments are recorded at fair
value. Changes in net unrealized holding gains and losses are reported as a component of comprehensive income in shareholders equity until realized. Investments in marketable securities are monitored for impairment and written down to fair
value with a charge to earnings if a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary.  The Company uses the cost method to account for its investments in non-marketable equity securities. A decline in the market value deemed to be other than
temporary is charged to earnings. During 2004, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $332,250 for other than temporary declines in the value of an investment in equity securities of a private company.  eProperty and Equipment  Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, for leasehold improvements, the term of the lease, if shorter. The estimated useful lives are as follows:  Years
Furniture and fixtures
3-7
Computer equipment
3
Leasehold improvements
3-11
Other equipment
3-7
Certain prior period
amounts for property and equipment and accrued expenses have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.  fFair Value of Financial Instruments 
The carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short
maturities.  gResearch and Development Costs
Research and development costs incurred prior to the
establishment of technological feasibility of the product are expensed as incurred. After technological feasibility is established, any additional software development costs are capitalized. The Company believes its process for developing software
is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, no software development costs have been capitalized to date.

In connection with the February 2003 acquisition of Orchestream Holdings plc, the Company recorded a
charge of $1,781,000 for purchased in process research and development. At the date of the acquisition, the purchased in process research and development projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses. The
projects generally included enhancements and upgrades to existing technology, enhanced communication among systems, introduction of new functionality and the development of new technology primarily for integration purposes. The value of the in
process research and development was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis of the anticipated income stream of the related product sales. The projected net cash flows were computed using discount rates ranging from 20% to 30% for the
various in process research and development projects. These projects were essentially completed by year-end 2003.  In connection with the February 2002 acquisition of certain operational support system assets from Nortel Networks, the Company recorded a charge of
$4,060,000 for purchased in process research and development. The projects generally included enhancements and upgrades to existing technology, enhanced communication among systems, introduction of new functionality and the development of new
technology primarily for integration purposes. The value of the in process research and development was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis of the anticipated income stream of the related product sales. The projected net cash flows were
computed using discount rates from 25% to 35% for the various purchased in process research and development projects. These projects were essentially completed by year-end 2002.  hAccounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by
the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairments to be recognized are measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower
of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.  iIncome Taxes  Income
taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the amounts of existing assets and liabilities recorded for
financial reporting purposes and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is reflected in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. Based upon the available
evidence, which included recent operating performance and projections for future near term performance, the Company recorded a valuation reserve against the remaining deferred tax assets on the books in 2003. The value of these tax benefits depends
on future taxable profits, and the Companys management believes it appropriate to fully reserve these assets until the Company begins to utilize these tax benefits.  jUse of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

kAccounting for Stock Options  The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for stock options
granted to employees and non-employee directors under its stock option plans. As such, compensation expense is recorded only if the fair value of the underlying stock exceeded its exercise price on the date of grant. Deferred compensation has been
recorded as a component of stockholders equity and is being amortized, based on a graded vesting schedule, as provided by FASB Interpretation No. 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award
Plans, and is charged to operations over the vesting period of options granted at less than fair market value. Amortization of deferred compensation was $377,000, $84,000, and $88,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.  Had the Company determined compensation cost
based on the fair value at the grant date for its stock options and activity under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, the Companys net loss would have been changed to the pro
forma amounts indicated below in thousands, except per share data:  Year ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 Net loss As reported 15,987 56,610 66,794 Add back: Stock-based employee compensation cost, net of related tax effects, included in the determination of net income as
reported 1,237 76 52 Subtract: Stock-based employee compensation cost, net of related tax effects that would have been included in the determination of net income
if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards 10,790 13,272 8,788 Pro forma net loss 25,540 68,673 75,530 Net loss per share of common stock Basic and diluted As reported 040 148 177 Pro forma 064 181 201
lComprehensive Loss  The
Company reports comprehensive loss in its consolidated statements of stockholders equity. Comprehensive loss includes, net of taxes, unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities and cumulative foreign currency translation
adjustments. The cumulative unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2004, was $146,000. The cumulative foreign currency translation gain as of December 31, 2004, was $516,000.  mForeign Currency Translations  For all significant non-U.S. operations, the functional currency is the
local currency. Assets and liabilities of those operations are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates for the reporting period. The resulting translation
adjustments are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of foreign receivables or
payables, are included in the consolidated statements of operations. The net foreign currency exchange gains losses were $257,000, $25,000, and $70,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively.

nEarnings Per Share of Common Stock  Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income or loss available
to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the incremental increase in common shares outstanding assuming the exercise of all stock options and conversion
of all preferred stock that would have had a dilutive effect on earnings per share.  oRecently Adopted Accounting Standards  New Accounting Standards  In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R, Share Based Payment, which was a revision of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. This statement supersedes APB Option 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and is effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005. This Statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date
fair value of the award with limited exceptions. That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awardthe requisite service period usually the vesting period. No
compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. Employee share purchase plans will not result in recognition of compensation cost if certain conditions are met; those conditions are
much the same as the related conditions in SFAS 123. The Company is planning to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of 2005. The estimated impact of this change in accounting will be an increase in stock compensation costs for existing
grants of approximately $15 million to $18 million per quarter in 2005.  In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which addresses
the effect of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 one time deduction for qualifying repatriations of foreign earnings. The implementation of this new law did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of
operations.  In January 2003, and December 2003, the FASB
issued and then revised Interpretation No. 46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51. FIN 46 requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if the company is subject to the
majority of the risk of loss from the entitys activities, is entitled to a majority of the entitys residual returns, or both. Certain provisions of this Interpretation were effective for the third quarter of 2003 and others were
effective January 1, 2004. FIN 46 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.  In January 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of an
asset retirement obligation be recognized as a liability in the period in which a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development, and/or normal use of the
assets is incurred. The Company also would record a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset. Subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation, the obligation is adjusted at the end of each period to
reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation. The adoption of Statement 143 did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations.  In November 2002, the FASB reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 00-21,
Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. In general, this issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities. The issue
addresses how to divide the arrangement into separate units of accounting consistent with the identified earnings process for revenue recognition purposes. This issue also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to
the separate units of accounting in the arrangement. This issue was applicable for MetaSolv, Inc.

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable
income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. For financial reporting purposes, a valuation allowance exists at December 31, 2004 to offset deferred tax assets based upon the tax losses incurred during years 2002
through 2004.  Subsequently recognized tax benefits relating to
the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2004, will be allocated as follows in thousands:  Income tax benefit that would be reported in the consolidated statement of earnings 77,193

Included in the above
valuation allowance is approximately $28,000,000 related to the acquired net operating loss carryforward of Orchestream. Any reduction in the valuation allowance related to these carryforwards will first be applied toward the remaining intangible
assets and then as a reduction of income tax expense.  The
Company has aggregate U.S. tax loss carryforwards of approximately $56,000,000, which expire through the year 2023. Excluding tax loss carryforwards for non-U.S. subsidiaries which are being liquidated, the Company has aggregate non-U.S. tax loss
carryforwards of approximately $93,500,000. The Company also has approximately $4,400,000 of U.S. research tax credit carryforwards that begin expiring in 2018 and $4,500,000 of non-U.S. research tax credits carryforwards that begin expiring in

vesting periods. The Company recorded compensation expense of $377,000 and $17,100 related to restricted stock awards in 2004 and 2003, respectively.  7Retirement and Savings Plans  The Company has various pension and savings plans under which employees are entitled to receive matching company contributions, subject to certain

and Concentration of Credit Risk  SFAS No. 131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires those enterprises to
report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to stockholders. The method for determining what information to report is based on the way management organizes the operating segments within the Company for
making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.  The Companys chief operating decision-maker is considered to be the President and Chief Executive Officer. The President and Chief Executive Officer reviews financial information presented on a Company-wide basis accompanied by
disaggregated information about revenues by product and service line for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. The financial information reviewed by the President and Chief Executive Officer is identical to the
information presented in the accompanying statements of operations. Therefore, the Company operates in a single operating segment: communications software and related services.

communication service providers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition but does not require collateral or other security to support its trade accounts receivable. One customer accounted for 11%
and 12% of the companys revenues in 2004 and 2003, respectively. A second customer accounted for 15% of the Companys revenues in 2002 and 36% of the Companys account receivable at December 31, 2002.  11Acquisitions  Orchestream Holdings plc.In February 2003,
the Company acquired London-based Orchestream Holdings plc, a recognized leader in Internet Protocol IP service activation software solutions for wire line and mobile carriers. The Orchestream acquisition added an IP service activation product to
the Companys portfolio and technology partnerships in Europe. The Company paid 006 per share of Orchestream common stock, valuing the transaction at approximately 7,902,000 $12,997,000. This acquisition became effective in
February 2003 and, as of March 31, 2003, the Company had acquired 92% of Orchestream common stock. Effective April 25, 2003, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining shares and Orchestream became a wholly owned subsidiary. 
The Company accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of
accounting, as required by SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The results of Orchestream were included with those of the Company effective February 2003.  The purchase price was allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities based
on their respective estimated fair values as of the closing date of the transaction. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets was allocated to goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes. In addition,
deferred taxes were recognized for the difference between the book and tax basis of certain intangible assets.

allocated to purchased in process research and development was charged to expense at the time of the acquisition. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition was not amortized and was subsequently written off see note 13.
The developed technology is being amortized over its useful life of three years; the customer relationships are being amortized over their useful life of five years; and the contract rights were amortized over one year.  OSS Assets from Nortel Networks.In February
2002, the Company completed the acquisition of certain OSS assets from Nortel Networks. With this acquisition, the Company extended its product portfolio by adding a leading carrier-class service activation product and several point solutions that
allow communications service providers to efficiently manage and deliver differentiated services for Internet Protocol IP, data, and wireless communications. As a result of the acquisition, the Company now offers a comprehensive suite of OSS
solutions available for wireless, IP, data, and traditional networks and services. The purchase price was $35,000,000 in cash, plus the assumption of certain liabilities of the business.  The asset purchase agreement provided for the reduction of the cash purchase price by $3,000,000, which was used to cover
the cost related to the issuance of stock options and retention bonuses to key employees. This cash payment was treated as a reduction of the purchase price. In addition, direct transaction costs were approximately $4,631,000.  The Company accounted for the acquisition as a business combination using the
purchase method of accounting, as required by Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, and No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The financial results of this
acquisition were included with those of the Company effective February 2002.  The total purchase price was allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities based on their respective estimated fair values as of the closing date of the transaction. The tangible assets were inventoried and
evaluated by an independent third party, and do not differ materially from the net book value in the historical financial statements of Nortel Networks. The identifiable assets, which consist of customer arrangements, the core technology related to
the products, and in process research and development costs, were valued by an independent third party. We allocated the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable

assets acquired to goodwill, which will be deductible for tax purposes over the next fifteen years. In addition, deferred taxes have been recognized for the
difference between the book and tax basis of certain intangible assets.  A summary of the allocation of the purchase price follows in thousands:  Cash paid to Nortel Networks upon closing 35,000 Less retention fund 3,000 Less cash for vacation liabilities assumed 1,037 Transaction costs 4,631 Total purchase price 35,594 Allocation of the purchase price Tangible assets acquired 3,761 Liabilities assumed 11,948 Net tangible assets acquired 8,187 Purchased in process research and development 4,060 Developed technology, including patents 12,236 Customer contracts 5,118 Net identifiable intangible assets acquired 21,414 Goodwill 22,367 Total purchase price 35,594  The $4,060,000
allocated to purchased in process research and development costs was charged to expense upon closing. The developed technology was amortized over its useful life of two years and the customer contracts are being amortized over their useful life of
three years.  12Restructuring and Other Costs 
In 2004, restructuring and other costs totaled $4,500,000 comprised of
$1,951,000 for a reduction of 65 positions, $1,689,000 related to consolidation of facilities and $860,000 in stock compensation expense related to a former executive.  In 2003, the Company continued to restructure its operations to align costs with expected market conditions, and to
integrate and rationalize the acquired Orchestream operations with those of the Company. This program resulted in pre-tax charges of $8,558,000 net of recapture of approximately $300,000 of previous severance accruals that were not needed and the
elimination of approximately 135 positions. These charges consisted of $4,369,000 for severance payments, $4,778,000 for lease commitments on office space that has been vacated, and a non-recurring adjustment to prepaid royalties of $815,000,
partially offset by a reduction in accrued liabilities of approximately $1,404,000 related to adjustments of liabilities assumed in the Companys acquisitions.  In 2002, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $12,126,000. These charges consisted of $5,064,000 for a
reduction in force of approximately 190 positions, $5,801,000 for lease commitments on office space that has been vacated, and approximately $2,265,000 of related asset write-downs, partially offset by $1,004,000 non recurring adjustments to accrued
royalties.

are expected to be completed by third quarter 2005 and the lease payments will continue through 2010.  13 Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets  The Company is required to assess the value of goodwill under the provisions of SFAS No. 142. The Company is one reporting unit, as defined by the standard. As outlined in the authoritative literature, the assessment
of whether goodwill has been impaired is based on the Companys estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit using a model that considers both a discounted future cash flow analysis and market capitalization data.  During 2002, the market capitalization of the Company fell to a level below
its book value. The decline in the market capitalization indicated that a potential reduction in the value of goodwill existed; therefore, management performed an interim valuation based on estimated future cash flows as of July 31, 2002. This
valuation indicated that an impairment of goodwill existed. Accordingly, the Company recorded a charge of $28,742,000 to eliminate the goodwill.  The market capitalization of the Company remained at a level below its book value in the first quarter of 2003. This prolonged decline in the market
capitalization indicated that the capitalization of goodwill as a result of the acquisition of Orchestream Holdings plc was not warranted. Accordingly, the Company eliminated the goodwill and recorded a charge of $2,227,000 at the time of the
Orchestream acquisition.  The changes in the carrying value of
goodwill for the two years ended December 31, 2003, are as follows in thousands:  Balance at of December 31, 2001 6,375 Purchase of assets from Nortel Networks 22,367 Impairment charge 28,742 Balance at December 31, 2002  Purchase of Orchestream 2,227 Impairment charge 2,227 Balance at December 31, 2003

Item 4.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure
that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify the Companys financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. As of
the end of the period covered by this report, we evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and the operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on that evaluation, and due to the existence of a material weakness described below, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report in alerting them on a timely basis to material information relating to the Company required to
be included in our periodic SEC reports. The material weakness did not impact our 2004 revenue, cash flow, or any other significant performance indicator. The deficiency did not result in a material misstatement in our 2004 financial statements nor
does it affect the Companys financial condition or future operations.  Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 15d-15f. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on
the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2004, because of the material weakness described below. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control
deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by management or employees in the normal course of performing
their assigned functions.  As of December 31, 2004, the Company
did not employ personnel with adequate expertise in matters related to the accounting for estimated income tax exposures and foreign income taxes. This control deficiency results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the
income tax accounts and disclosures in the annual or interim consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected.  KPMG LLP, our registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
Their report is included below in the section titled Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.  Changes in Internal Controls.There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the
fourth quarter of 2004 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  The Board of Directors and Stockholders MetaSolv, Inc.  We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Item
9Ab, that MetaSolv, Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, because of the effect of a material weakness in the accounting for income tax exposures and foreign income taxes identified in
managements assessment, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. MetaSolv, Inc.s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A companys
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control
deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The following material weakness has been identified and included in
managements assessment as of December 31, 2004: The Company did not employ personnel with adequate expertise in matters related to the accounting for income tax exposures and foreign income taxes.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of MetaSolv, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive
income loss, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004. The aforementioned material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2004
consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 28, 2005, which expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, MetaSolv, Inc. has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in
