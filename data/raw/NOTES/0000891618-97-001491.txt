stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 1996. These financial statements are the

assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of CyberMedia, Inc. as of
December 31, 1996 and 1995 and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1996 in

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization
CyberMedia, Inc. the Company, a Delaware corporation, develops and
markets software products that provide automatic service and support to PC users
in the Windows environment. Products are principally sold to distributors and
directly to consumers. In addition, the Company products are sold directly to
catalog companies throughout the United States and Canada. The Company also
markets its products internationally through distribution and licensing
agreements, and during 1996, approximately 10% of the Company net revenues
were from international sales. Prior to 1996, international sales were less than
5% of net revenues.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments having original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Inventory
Inventory, consisting of software product and related packaging materials,
is stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market. Inventory
is shown net of valuation allowances of $430,000 at December 31, 1996.
Unearned Revenues
The Company offers customers update rights for certain products at no
additional cost. As a result, ratable revenue recognition is appropriate for a
portion of the license fees for such products. Accordingly, unearned revenues on
the accompanying balance sheets represent Internet and other product updates and
other unspecified future support commitments which will be recognized ratably
over the estimated update periods.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are generated from sales of software to distributors, resellers
and end-users and are recognized upon shipment of products, net of provisions
for estimated future returns and price protection, provided that no significant
vendor obligations remain and collection of accounts receivable is deemed to be
probable. On sales of products having remaining vendor obligations, a portion of
related revenue is deferred based upon the relative retail value of future
obligations and recognized ratably over the estimated period for which
obligations exist, generally one year from the date of sale.
The Company provides routine telephone customer support as an accommodation
to purchasers of its products for a limited time. Costs associated with such
post-sale customer support were immaterial.
Revenue Related Allowances
Allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts are established based
upon historical experience and management estimates as shipments are made. The
allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts aggregated $767,000 and
$1,523,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively, and is shown as a
reduction of accounts receivable on the accompanying balance sheets. The
allowance for sales returns includes the Company estimation of costs related
to its price protection policy. Such costs have historically been immaterial.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Research and Development
Costs relating to designing, developing and testing new software products
are expensed as research and development as incurred. Although costs incurred
subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of software products are
permitted capitalization pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 86 Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold,
Leased or Otherwise Marketed, the Company has not capitalized any software
development costs since the impact to the financial statements for all periods
presented has been immaterial.
Depreciation and Amortization
Furniture, fixtures and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of
furniture, fixtures and equipment is calculated on the straight-line
depreciation method over the estimated useful lives as follows:
Computer equipment and purchased software. 3 years
Office furniture and equipment.
4 years
Assets under capital lease.
Shorter of lease term or the
estimated useful life of the asset
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using SFAS No. 109 Accounting for
Income Taxes. Under the asset and liability method of SFAS No. 109, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. Under SFAS No. 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.
Computation of Net Loss per Share
Net loss per share of Common Stock and Common Stock equivalents has been
computed using the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock and Common
Stock equivalents outstanding using the treasury stock method and is summarized
as follows:
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
1994     1995     1996
Weighted average shares of Common Stock outstanding. 2,445,000   2,461,000   4,274,000
Weighted average shares of Common Stock equivalents. 5,394,000   5,394,000   3,957,000
Shares used in net loss per share calculation. 7,839,000   7,855,000   8,231,000
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Common Stock, stock options, warrants and Convertible Preferred Stock issued by
the Company during the twelve months immediately preceding the initial public
offering date have been included in the calculation of the weighted average
shares outstanding for all periods presented using the treasury stock method
based on the initial public offering price for stock options and warrants and
using the if converted method for Convertible Preferred Stock. Accordingly,
weighted average Common Stock outstanding includes 1,272,000 shares of Common
Stock issued during 1996 shown as outstanding for all periods presented. In
addition, weighted average Common Stock equivalents outstanding includes
1,375,000 Common Stock equivalents for Common Stock options and warrants issued
during 1995 and 1996 and 4,019,000 shares assumed to be issued upon the

conversion of the Series B and Series C Preferred Stock into Common Stock, shown
as outstanding for all periods presented, except for the 1996 year where such
equivalents are only outstanding through the initial public offering date.
Financial Instruments
The Financial Accounting Standards Board SFAS No. 107 Disclosures about
Fair Value of Financial Instruments defines fair value of a financial
instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties. The Company carrying value of cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, grant
payable, capital lease obligations and notes payable approximates fair value
because the instrument has a short-term maturity or because the applicable
interest rates are comparable to current borrowing rates.
Long-Lived Assets
The Company adopted the provisions SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, on
January 1, 1996. This Statement requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to
be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset
to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets
are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by
the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of
the assets. Adoption of this Statement did not have a material impact on the
Company financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Accounting for Stock Options
Prior to January 1, 1996, the Company accounted for its stock option plan
in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations.
As such, compensation expense would be recorded on the date of grant only if the
current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price. On
January 1, 1996, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123. Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, which permits entities to recognize as expense over the vesting
period the fair value of all stock-based awards on the date of grant.
Alternatively, SFAS No. 123 also allows entities to continue to apply the
provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and provide pro forma net income and pro forma
earnings per share disclosures for employee stock option grants made in 1995 and
future years as if the fair-value-based method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been
applied. The Company has elected to continue to apply the provisions of APB
Opinion No. 25 and provide the pro forma disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123.
Use of Estimates
Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions
relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities to prepare these financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

4 GRANT PAYABLE
In August 1992, the Company received a grant under the Program for the
Advancement of Commercial Technology Provided by the United States Agency for
International Development and administered by the Industrial Credit and
Investment Corporation of India Limited ICICI. As of December 31, 1994, the
Company had received $318,000 which had been allocated to the Company,
concurrent with the development of its products. Under the terms of the
agreement, the Company repays the grant at a rate of 250% of the amount of grant
received, or $795,000, through royalties based on 5% of product sales, as
defined. The agreement provides that in the event expected future revenue
generated from the exploitation of certain technology specified in the agreement
does not meet such expectation, the Company will repay the grant at an amount
less than $795,000. The Company accrued royalty expense related to this grant of
$276,000 during the year ended December 31, 1995. During the year ended December
31, 1996, the Company has reduced the royalty amount accrued to $95,000,
representing the total royalty amount the Company expects to pay in addition to
the original grant amount of $318,000.
5 NOTE PAYABLE
At December 31, 1995, the Company had a note payable to ICICI, bearing
interest at the U.S. prime rate plus 225%, with principal payable in equal
quarterly installments of $50,000 plus interest from January 1997 through April
1999. To secure the loan, certain directors and founders of the Company provided
personal guarantees for the total loan amount. In consideration for the personal
guarantees, the guarantors received warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of
900,000 shares of the Company Series A Preferred Stock at an

exercise price of $035 per share. As of December 31, 1996, the Company repaid
the total obligation of $500,000 in full.
6 NOTES PAYABLE TO BANK
The Company has a revolving line of credit of $3,000,000 based on eligible
accounts receivable. The line of credit bears interest at the prime rate 825%
per annum at December 31, 1996 plus 1% and expires in April 1997. As of
December 31, 1996, the Company had no outstanding borrowings on the revolving
line of credit. The line of credit is collateralized by all assets of the
Company. The Company is restricted under the revolving line of credit from
declaring or paying a dividend on any of its capital stock without bank consent.
7 INCOME TAXES
The provision for income taxes, all current, for the years ended December
31, 1994, 1995 and 1996 consists solely of the annual minimum California
franchise tax of approximately $1,000.
The provision for income taxes differs from the expected tax benefit
computed by applying the federal corporate tax rate of 34% to loss before income
taxes principally due to the effect of net operating loss carryforwards.
The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant
portions of deferred tax assets are summarized as follows:
DECEMBER 31,
1995      1996
Deferred tax assets:
$  307,000   $  474,000
Accrued     32,000     140,000
Unearned    243,000    1,333,000
Grant    127,000    127,000
Net operating   1,506,000    1,124,000
--     47,000
Total gross deferred tax assets.  2,215,000    2,991,000
Less valuation   2,215,000   2,991,000
Net deferred tax  $    --   $                                       
The net change in the valuation allowance for the years ended December 31,
1994, 1995 and 1996 was an increase of $446,000, $1,359,000 and $776,000,
respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred
tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management
considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making
this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections
for future taxable income over the periods in which the level of deferred tax
assets are deductible, management believes that it is not more likely than not
that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences at
December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1996. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has
been provided for the total gross deferred tax assets.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
The Company had available at December 31, 1996 approximately $3,070,000 of
net operating losses to offset future Federal taxable income that expire
beginning in the year 2006. Use of these net operating losses will be limited
under rules governing changes in ownership of the Company. These rules restrict
the amount of the net operating loss carryforwards which may be used in a
particular year. The maximum amount of net operating loss carryforwards which
are available on an annual basis for use subsequent to the year ended December
31, 1996 is approximately $214,000.

SFAS No. 123, the Company net loss and loss per share would have been
increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

Pro  $   43  $   49
The weighted-average fair value of options granted during the year ended
December 31, 1995 and 1996 was $08 and $47, respectively, using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions: 1996 and 1995 -- expected volatility of 704%, risk-free interest
rate of 64%, no expected dividends and an expected life of 4 years.
Pro forma net loss reflects only options granted in 1995 and 1996.
Therefore, the full impact of calculating compensation cost for stock options
under SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in the pro forma net loss amounts presented
above because compensation cost is reflected over the option vesting periods of
up to four years and compensation cost for options granted prior to January 1,
1995 is not considered.
During the year ended December 31, 1996, the Company issued Common Stock to
certain directors who exercised unvested options to purchase 206,250 shares of
Common Stock, subject to the terms of their respective stock option agreements.
As defined more fully in the stock option agreements, the Company retains the
right to purchase such stock at the original exercise price.
In June 1996, the Company Board of Directors approved the 1996 Director
Option Plan. The Plan provides for the automatic and nondiscretionary grant of
nonstatutory stock options to nonemployee directors of the Company who are first
elected to the Board after the adoption of the Director Option Plan outside
directors. A total of 50,000 shares of Common Stock have been reserved for
issuance under the Director Option Plan. Each outside director elected after the
adoption of the Plan will automatically be granted an option to purchase 5,000
shares on the date on which such person first becomes an outside director
First Option at the fair market value of the Company Common Stock at the
date of grant. Each First Option granted vests ratably over specified periods,
approximately four years, subject to continued service as an outside director.
Thereafter, each outside director will be automatically granted an option to
purchase 5,000 shares on December 1 of each year beginning in 1997, provided he
or she shall have served on the Board for at least six months subsequent
option. Each subsequent option shall have an exercise price equal to the fair
value of the Company Common Stock as of the date of grant and shall be
exercisable ratably over four years, beginning three years and one month from
the date of grant, subject to continued service as an outside director. To date,
no options have been granted under the 1996 Director Option Plan.

10 SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS, CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND OTHER
CONCENTRATIONS
Significant Customers
Sales to certain customers represented 10% or more of the Company net
revenues for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996. Sales to these
customers were as follows:
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER

Company   13%      --       
Concentration of Credit Risk

risk. These financial instruments consist primarily of trade receivables. The
Company sells to distributors, resellers and directly to end-users. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances
for doubtful accounts and estimates of potential future product returns. The
Company three major customers in 1995 represented 41%, 26% and 21 respectively, of trade accounts receivable, net at December 31, 1995. The

Other Concentrations
One product line constitutes over 90% of the Company net revenues for the
years ended December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996. Any technical difficulties or
other factors affecting sales of this product line could adversely affect
operating results.

services from two fulfillment firms. A delay in product shipments from these
fulfillment companies could result in a possible loss of sales, which could
adversely affect operating results.
