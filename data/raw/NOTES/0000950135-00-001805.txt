REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Sapient Corporation   In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December
31, 1999 and the related consolidated statements of income, of changes in
stockholders' equity, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Sapient Corporation and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 NATURE OF BUSINESS

e-business consulting and Internet commerce solutions. Through the delivery of
integrated services from strategy and business transformation consulting through

Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Denver, Houston, London,
England and Sydney, Australia.
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.
On October 8, 1999, the Company acquired substantially all of the net
assets of E.Lab L.L.C. E.Lab in exchange for 88,044 shares of common stock. On
August 25, 1998, the Company acquired Studio Archetype, Inc. Studio Archetype
in exchange for 996,628 shares of common stock and $250,000 in cash. The
acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and accordingly, the purchase price
was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their
respective fair values. The results of operations of the acquired companies are
included in the Company Statements of Income from the respective dates of
acquisition.
On March 29, 1999, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock
of Adjacency, Inc. Adjacency in exchange for 1,581,348 shares of the Company
common stock. On December 15, 1997, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
common stock of EXOR Technologies, Inc. EXOR in exchange for 1,223,476 shares
of the Company common stock. The Company Consolidated Financial Statements
have been restated for all periods presented to reflect the acquisitions of
Adjacency and EXOR, which have been accounted for as poolings of interests See
Note 12.
Certain amounts in previously issued financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
b Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
c Cash and Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or
less are considered cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalent balances consist
of deposits and repurchase agreements with a large U.S. commercial bank and
high-grade commercial paper. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company has
classified its cash equivalent investments, totaling approximately $192 million
and $60 million respectively, as available-for-sale. These investments are
stated at amortized costs, which approximates fair value.
32
35
SAPIENT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
d Short term Investments
Short term investments are available-for-sale securities which are recorded
at fair market value. The difference between amortized cost and fair market
value, net of tax effect, is shown as a separate component of stockholders'
equity. The cost of securities available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization
of premiums and discounts to maturity. Interest and amortization of premiums and
discounts for all securities are included in interest income. Realized gains and
losses from sales of available-for-sale securities were not material for any
period presented.
e Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to a
concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts
receivable.
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. The Company
maintains allowances for potential credit losses and such losses have been
within management expectations. Write-offs of accounts receivable have not
been material for any of the periods presented. No customer accounted for
greater than 10 percent of total revenues in 1999, 1998 or 1997. One customer
accounted for 14 percent of accounts receivable at December 31, 1998.
The fair market values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable, accrued expenses and debt instruments at both December 31,
1999 and 1998 approximate their carrying amounts.
f Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets,
which range from three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term.
g Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangibles
Goodwill and other purchased intangibles are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over lives ranging from four to seven years.
h Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed of, the carrying value of intangible assets and other long-lived
assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or
circumstances, both internally and externally, that may suggest impairment. To
date, no such impairment has been indicated. Should there be an impairment in
the future, the Company will measure the amount of the impairment based on the
fair value of the impaired assets. The cash flow estimates that will be used
will contain management best estimates, using appropriate and customary
assumptions and projections at the time.
i Other Assets
Other assets include long term investments recorded under both the cost and
equity methods of accounting. The Company uses the equity method of accounting
for investments when it has an ownership interest of 20% to 50% or the ability
to exercise significant influence over an investee operating activities.
Investments accounted for under the equity method and cost method amounted to
approximately $16 million and $600,000 at December 31, 1999, respectively.

j Revenue Recognition
All revenue generated from fixed-price contracts is recognized on the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting based on the ratio of costs
incurred to total estimated costs. All revenue generated from time and material
contracts is recognized as services are provided. Revenues from maintenance
agreements are recognized ratably over the terms of the agreements.
Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made on a
contract by contract basis and are recognized in the period in which such losses
are determined. Unbilled revenues on contracts comprise costs plus earnings on
contracts in excess of contractual billings on such contracts. Billings in
excess of costs plus earnings are classified as deferred revenues.
k Research and Development Costs
Substantially all research and development activities of the Company
except those incurred in connection with purchased business combinations have
been pursuant to customer contracts and, accordingly, have been expensed as
project costs as incurred. The Company has not capitalized any software
development costs since such costs have not been significant.
l Stock-Based Compensation
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123 requires
that companies either recognize compensation expense for grants of stock, stock
options, and other equity instruments based on fair value, or provide pro forma
disclosure of net income and net income per share in the notes to the financial
statements. The Company applies APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized
under SFAS 123 for the Company stock option plans, and footnote disclosure is
provided in Note 9.
The deferred compensation expense appearing in the financial statements
relates to stock options that were granted to Adjacency employees at below fair
market value, prior to the acquisition by the Company. The deferred compensation
is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of three
years. Certain employees completed their vesting upon the business combination
described in Note 9f.
m Income Taxes
The Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income
tax bases, operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date.
n Earnings Per Share
Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, the Company
presents both basic net income per share and diluted net income per share. Basic
net income per share is based on the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share reflects the per
share effect of dilutive stock options.

o Comprehensive Income
During 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income SFAS 130. SFAS 130
establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in
the body of the financial statements. Comprehensive income includes net income
as currently reported under generally accepted accounting principles and also
considers the effect of additional economic events that are not required to be
recorded in determining net income but are rather reported as a separate
component of stockholders' equity. The Company reports foreign currency
translation gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on short term
investments as a component of comprehensive income.
p Segment Reporting
The Company engages in business activities in one operating segment, which
provides e-business consulting, and Internet commerce solutions primarily on a
fixed-price, fixed-timeframe basis. The Company services are delivered to
clients primarily in North America, and the Company long-lived assets are
located primarily in North America.
q Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133.
This statement was amended by the issuance of SFAS 137, Deferral of the
Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, which changed the effective date of
SFAS 133 to all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000 and requires that all
derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current
earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is
designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge
transaction. Management of the Company anticipates that the adoption of SFAS 133
will not have a material impact on the Company financial position or its
results of operations.
3 SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS
At December 31, 1999 and 1998, all of the Company short term investments
were classified as available-for-sale. Short term investments are carried on the

At December 31, 1999 and 1998, deferred income tax assets and liabilities

In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the Company
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Due to the fact that the
Company has sufficient taxable income in the federal carryback period and
anticipates sufficient future taxable income over the periods in which the
differences which created the deferred income tax assets are deductible, the
ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets for federal and state income
tax purposes is considered more likely than not.

can be reasonably estimated.
9 STOCK PLANS
a 1992 Stock Option Plan
During 1992, the Company approved the 1992 Stock Plan the 1992 Plan for
its employees. The 1992 Plan provided for the Board of Directors to grant stock
options, stock purchase authorizations and stock bonus awards up to an aggregate
of 10,000,000 shares of non-voting common stock. Since consummation of its
initial public offering of common stock in April 1996, no further grants or

which shares may be purchased with an option was specified by the Board at the
date the option was granted, but in the case of an ISO, was not less than the
fair market value of the Company common stock on the date of grant. The
duration of any option was specified by the Board, but no option designated as
an ISO can be exercised beyond ten years from the date of grant. Stock options
granted under the 1992 Plan generally become exercisable over a four-year
period, are nontransferable, and expire six years after the date of grant
subject to earlier termination in the event of the termination of the
optionee employment or other relationship with the Company.

market value of the common stock. Stock options granted under the 1996 Plan are
nontransferable, generally become exercisable over a four-year period and expire

unpurchased shares available from previous offerings for the first six
offerings, and 120,000 shares plus any unpurchased shares available from
previous offerings for the next six offerings. An employee becomes eligible to
participate in the Purchase Plan when he or she is regularly employed by the
Company for at least 20 hours a week and for more than five months in a calendar
year on the first day of the applicable offering. The price at which employees
may purchase common stock in an offering is 85 percent of the closing price of
the common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the day the offering commences
or on the day the offering terminates, whichever is lower. Approximately 55
percent, 61 percent and 57 percent of eligible employees participated in at
least one of the two offerings under the Purchase Plan during the years ended
December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Under the Purchase Plan, the

director elected to the Board of Directors after the adoption of the Director
Plan will, upon his or her election, automatically be granted an option to
purchase 20,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the grant
date fair market value of the Company common stock. Options granted pursuant
to the Directors Plan vest in four equal annual installments commencing on the
first anniversary of the date of grant and generally expire ten years after the
date of grant. As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, no options had been granted
under the Director Plan.

are granted and determines the number of shares, the exercise or purchase
prices, the vesting terms and the expiration date. Non-qualified stock options
may be granted at exercise prices which are above, equal to or below the grant
date fair market value of the common stock. The exercise price of options
qualifying as Incentive Stock Options may not be less than the grant date fair
market value of the common stock. Stock options granted under the 1998 Plan are

f Adjacency, Inc. 1998 Stock Option Plan
In connection with the acquisition of Adjacency, the Company assumed the
outstanding options granted under the Adjacency 1998 Stock Option Plan the
Adjacency Plan. The Adjacency Plan was originally adopted by Adjacency in
1998 and provided for the grant of stock options up to an aggregate of 4,000,000
shares of Class B common stock of Adjacency. In November 1998, prior to the
acquisition, Adjacency had granted a total of 437,000 options to its employees
at exercise prices between $236 and $1215 per share. The shares vested ratably
over three years starting on the date of employment, except for certain
employees who were granted accelerated vesting upon a change-in-control of
Adjacency. The total compensation charge to be taken over the vesting period is
approximately $72 million, resulting from the fact that the options were
granted at below fair market value. The charge in the fourth quarter of 1998 of
approximately $45 million was the result of certain employees being
substantially vested by December 31, 1998. A charge of approximately $17
million in the first quarter of 1999 was the result of the change-in-control
provisions. Beyond the first quarter of 1999, the Company expects the
compensation expense to be approximately $100,000 per quarter for the next seven
quarters. Stock-based compensation was approximately $20 million for the year
ended December 31, 1999. As a result of the acquisition, the Company has assumed
the obligations related to options to purchase 126,508 shares of the Company
common stock. No further grants may be made pursuant to the Adjacency Plan, and
previously outstanding options remain outstanding, and are exercisable for
shares of the Company common stock.

The Company has five stock-based compensation plans, which are described
above. The Company applies APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for its plans. Had compensation cost for the awards under those plans
been determined based on the grant date fair values consistent with the method
required under SFAS 123, the Company net income and net income per share would
have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below                         1999     1998     1997

average assumptions for grants in 1999, 1998 and 1997: dividend yield of 00
percent for each year, expected volatility of 725, 1368 and 648 percent in
1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, risk free interest rates ranging from 50 to

expected to be made each year, the pro forma impact on the three years ended
December 31, 1999 is not representative of the pro forma effects which may be
expected in future years.
10 RETIREMENT PLANS
The Company established a 401k retirement savings plan for employees in
June 1994. Under the provisions of the plan, the Company matches 25 percent of
an employee contribution, up to a maximum of $1,250 per employee per year.
Total Company contributions in 1999, 1998 and 1997 were approximately
$1,438,000, $957,000 and $520,000, respectively.
11 STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
a Increase in Authorized Common Stock; Stock Splits
At the Company Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 8, 1998, the
stockholders voted to approve an amendment to the Company Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation which increased the number of authorized shares of
common stock from 40,000,000 to 100,000,000.
On January 29, 1998, the Company declared a two-for-one stock split
effected as a 100 percent stock dividend distributed on March 9, 1998, to all
shareholders of record on February 20, 1998.
On October 21, 1999, the Company declared a two-for-one stock split
effected as a 100 percent stock dividend distributed on November 5, 1999, to all
shareholders of record on November 1, 1999.

12 ACQUISITIONS
On October 8, 1999, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of
E.Lab for approximately $50 million, including acquisition costs of
approximately $875,000. The Company issued 88,044 shares of its common stock and
assumed certain liabilities of E.Lab, a provider of experience modeling
services. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly, the
purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their respective fair values. Included in intangible assets on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 1999 is
approximately $57 million related to the E.Lab acquisition. This is comprised
of approximately $500,000 for assembled workforce and $52 million for goodwill,
which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
identifiable assets acquired. These intangible assets are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over a period of four to seven years.
Below are the pro forma results of operations for the Company and E.Lab,
assuming that the acquisition of E.Lab occurred at the beginning of the

SAPIENT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
In connection with the acquisition of Studio Archetype in the third quarter
of 1998, the Company allocated $111 million to in-process technology and
recorded a corresponding income tax benefit of $42 million. This allocation
represents the estimated fair value of such technology based on risk-adjusted
cash flows related to the development of projects that had not reached
technological feasibility at the time of the acquisition and with respect to
which the in-process research and development had no alternative future uses.
Accordingly, this allocation was charged to expense as of the acquisition date.
The Company allocated values to the acquired in-process research and
development projects by identifying significant research projects for which
technological feasibility had not been established, including development,
engineering and testing activities associated with the introduction of Studio
Archetype next-generation enterprise-wide suite of development, scheduling,
bug tracking and content management applications. The integrated solution is
comprised of the following technologies: content management systems CMS, an
Intranet, an Extranet, an Issues Server and an on-line User Interface Lab UI
Lab which together allow developers and clients to access prototypes and trial
deliverables that fully integrates user interface tools with client server,
advanced database and legacy systems. The CMS, Intranet and Extranet components
of the system were released in June 1999. The UI Lab was completed in March 1999
and the Issue Server was completed in September 1999. The integrated solution is
a comprehensive enterprise scale system. All components of the in-process R
project acquired by the Company with the acquisition of Studio Archetype are
presently being piloted on several client projects with the anticipation of
rolling-out the integrated, enterprise-wide solution in 2000. At the time of the
acquisition, expenditures on these projects were approximately $25 million, and
estimated costs to complete these projects were expected to total approximately
$625,000. The nature of the efforts to develop the acquired in-process
technology into commercially viable products and services principally related to
the completion of all planning, designing, prototyping, verification, and
testing activities that were necessary to establish that the proposed
technologies met their design specifications including functional, technical,
and economic performance requirements. The efforts to develop the purchased
in-process technology also included testing of the technology for compatibility
and interoperability with other applications. The value assigned to purchased
in-process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the
purchased in-process technology into commercially viable products, estimating
the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash
flows to their present value. The revenue projection used to value the
in-process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market
sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology and the nature and
expected timing of new product introductions by Studio Archetype and its
competitors. The Company did not experience any material variations in costs to
complete or completion dates from its initial assumptions. Following the
acquisition of Studio Archetype, Studio Archetype was fully integrated into the
Company operations, making the isolation of specific revenues attributable to
the in-process technologies difficult. However, nothing has occurred to
materially change the Company expectations with respect to the underlying
assumptions used in projecting the expected future revenues associated with this
in-process R
The rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value
were based on venture capital rates of return. Due to the nature of the forecast
and the risks associated with the projected growth, profitability and
developmental projects, discount rates of 25 to 30 percent were utilized for the
business enterprise and for the in-process research and development. The Company
believes that these discount rates were commensurate with Studio Archetype
stage of development, the uncertainties in the economic estimates described
above, the inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the
purchased in-process technology, the useful life of such technology, the
profitability levels of such technology, and the uncertainty of future
technological advances at that time.
Other intangible assets of $144 million is comprised of approximately $38
million for marketing assets, $16 million for assembled work force and $90
million of goodwill comprising the reputation of Studio Archetype. These assets
are being amortized on a straight-line basis over lives ranging from 4 to 7
years.
