REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Maplnfo Corporation and Subsidiaries
We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedule of MapInfo Corporation and Subsidiaries listed in Item
14a of this Form 10-K. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of MapInfo
Corporation and Subsidiaries as of September 30, 1996 and 1995, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended September 30, 1996 in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedule referred to above, when considered in relation to
the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all
material respects, the information required to be included therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Nature of Operations
The Company designs, develops, markets, licenses and supports mapping
software products, application development tools, and data products, together
with a range of consulting, training and technical support services. These
products are sold through multiple distribution channels, including an
indirect channel of value-added resellers and distributors, a corporate
account sales force, and a telemarketing sales group. The Company markets its
products worldwide through sales offices in North America, Europe, Australia,
China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MapInfo
Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries formed in 1994 in Germany and in
1995 in the United Kingdom and Australia. Significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principals requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets & liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For the purpose of the cash flows statements, the Company defines cash and
cash equivalents as cash and investments with original maturities of three
months or less.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market as determined on the
average cost method and consist primarily of computer media, user manuals and
software packaging supplies.
Short-term Investments
Short-term investments are stated at amortized cost, which approximates
market value.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets two to
ten years for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax
purposes. When assets are sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of, the
applicable costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
and the resulting gain or loss is recognized.
Product Development Costs
Product development costs, including product enhancements, are capitalized
after technological feasibility has been established. These costs are reported
at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value and are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over two years, the estimated economic life
of the products. Annual amortization under the straight-line method is greater
than the ratio of current gross revenue to total expected product revenues
method. Amortization expense is classified as research and development expense
in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net
assets acquired. Intangible assets are being amortized using the straight-line
method over seven years. The Company continually evaluates the existence of
goodwill impairment on the basis of whether the goodwill is fully recoverable
from projected, undiscounted net cash flows of the related business unit.
Revenue Recognition
Product revenue: Revenue from software license and technology development
fees is recognized upon the later of shipment of product or completion of
significant obligations to customers, if collectibility of the resulting
receivable is probable. Upon the recognition of revenue, all costs associated
with insignificant obligations are accrued.
Postcontract customer support PCS: Generally, PCS that is bundled with an
initial licensing fee is for one year or less and is recognized together with
the initial licensing fee on delivery of the software, if collectibility of
the resulting receivable is probable and enhancements and the costs of
providing these services are expected to be insignificant. When PCS is sold
under separate agreements, the revenue is recognized ratably over the term of
the agreement.
Reserve for Returns
The Company as a matter of policy provides the buyer the right to return the
product within 30 days, for a refund of the purchase price or replacement of
the product. Accordingly, the Company accrues for estimated future returns.
Income Taxes
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109-Accounting for Income
Taxes requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are
recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying
enacted statutory tax rates applicable for future years to differences between
financial statement and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. The
effect of tax rate changes on deferred taxes is recognized in the income tax
provision in the period that includes the enactment date.
Business tax credits are recorded by the flow-through method of accounting,
whereby they are applied as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the
credits are utilized.
Foreign Currency
The assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiaries are
translated at year-end exchange rates, and the income statements are
translated at the average rate of exchange for the year. Gains or losses
resulting from translating non-U.S. currency financial statements are
accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity. Gains and losses
from foreign currency transactions are included in net income.
Computation of Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common
and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive
common equivalent shares consist of stock options using the treasury stock
method.

responsible for such costs as real estate taxes and maintenance. The Company
may acquire these facilities through the termination of these leases at
negotiated purchase prices. The leases expire in 2002 and 2004.

initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of
September 30, 1996 decline from $18 million in 1997 to $14 million in 2001.

Bad debt reserve                44   106

Capitalized product development costs     210  269
Tax credit carryovers                 379

Net long term deferred tax asset liability 118  385
Net deferred tax asset             $775 $1,230
There are no valuation allowances recorded against the Company deferred tax
assets, as it is more likely than not that all future tax benefits will be
realized against future taxable income. However, the amount of deferred tax
assets, considered realizable could be reduced in the near term if estimates
of future taxable income are reduced.
