Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
TRAILER BRIDGE, INC.
Financial Statements for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December
31, 2005 and Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Stockholders
Trailer Bridge, Inc.
Jacksonville, Florida
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Trailer Bridge, Inc. as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004 and the related statements of operations, changes in
stockholders' equity capital deficit, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2005. We have also audited the financial
statement schedule listed in a. These financial statements and the
accompanying schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and schedule are free of material misstatement. The Company is not
required to have nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal
controls over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and schedule, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements and schedule. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Trailer Bridge, Inc. at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also in our opinion, the schedule presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.                       BDO Seidman, LLP

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED December 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization - Trailer Bridge, Inc. the Company is a domestic trucking and
marine transportation company with contract and common carrier authority.
Highway transportation services are offered in the continental United States,
while marine transportation is offered between Jacksonville, Florida and San
Juan, Puerto Rico.
Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers cash on hand and amounts on
deposit with financial institutions with original maturities of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - The Company records a monthly provision based
on specific known collectibility problems, historical losses, and current
economic information. In addition, the Company performs an analysis of the total
receivables on a quarterly basis, and adjusts the provision account to the
calculated balance. It is the Company policy to write off receivables once it
is determined that additional efforts of collection will not result in the
receipt of the receivable.
Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are carried at cost. Property
and equipment are depreciated to their estimated salvage values on a
straight-line method based on the following estimated useful lives                                  Years
Buildings and structures                      40
Office furniture and equipment                  6-10
Leasehold improvements                      2-12
Freight equipment:                        4-40
Vessels                             20-40
Tractors                             4
Containers, Chassis and VTM                  18
Trailers                             12
During 2004, the Company had an appraisal performed on its vessels, containers
and chassis, which included a review of the useful lives. The results of this
appraisal indicated an increase in the useful life of these assets, from the
lives originally estimated by the Company. As such, management revised its
estimate of the remaining useful lives of chassis, VTMs Specialized containers
for carrying vehicles, vessels and containers to extend the useful live by
approximately 6 to 10 years. During 2004, a change in accounting estimate was
recognized to reflect this decision, resulting in a decrease of depreciation
expense for 2004 by approximately $409,000 and as an increase in net income of
approximately $409,000 or $03 per basic and diluted share.
The Company expenses maintenance and repair expenses, including regulatory
drydocking of its vessels as incurred.
Tires on revenue equipment purchased are capitalized as part of the equipment
cost and depreciated over the life of the vehicle. Replacement tires are
expensed when placed in service.
Leasehold improvements and equipment under capital leases are amortized over the
lesser of the estimated lives of the asset or the lease terms. Maintenance and
repairs are expensed as incurred.                   Page 34 TRAILER BRIDGE, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED December 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003 continued Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by net
undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets
are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by
the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets.
Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or
fair value less cost to sell.
Other Assets - Other assets consist mainly of debt issuance costs that are
amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the associated
debt.
Revenue Recognition and Classification - Voyage revenue is recognized ratably
over the duration of a voyage based on the relative transit time in each
reporting period; commonly referred to as the percentage of completion method.
Voyage expenses are recognized as incurred. Demurrage and charterhire revenue
are included in our revenues. Demurrage is a charge assessed for failure to
return empty freight equipment on time. Charter hire is rental revenue for
vessels not in use in a liner service. The Company recognizes demurrage and
charterhire revenue based on negotiated fees included in the contracts of our
customers. These amounts are computed daily and included in Operating Revenue.
Income Taxes - Income taxes are calculated using the liability method specified
by SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. Valuation allowances are provided
against deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some
portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Earnings Per Share - Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing
earnings applicable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential
dilution of securities that could share in the earnings.
Stock-Based Compensation - In accordance with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No. 123, the Company has elected to continue
to account for its employee stock compensation plans under Accounting Principles
Board APB Opinion No. 25, with pro forma disclosures of net earnings and
earnings per share, as if the fair value based method of accounting defined in
SFAS No. 123 had been applied. Under the intrinsic value based method,
compensation cost is the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the stock
at the grant date or other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay
to acquire the stock. Under the fair value based method, compensation cost is
measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized
over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. The following
table provides an expanded reconciliation for all periods presented that adds
back to reported net income loss the recorded expense under APB 25, net of
related income tax effects, deducts the total fair value expense under SFAS 123,
net of related income tax effects and shows the reported and pro forma earnings
per share amounts.                   Page 35 TRAILER BRIDGE, INC.

accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
Reclassifications - Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2004 and
2003 financial statements to conform with the presentation adopted in 2005.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment
of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 or SFAS 151. SFAS 151 clarifies the accounting for
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted
materials spoilage. In addition, this statement requires that allocation of
fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on normal
capacity of production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for the first annual
reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 151 is not
expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial
condition.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payment, a revision
of SFAS 123 or SFAS 123R. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Bulletin No. 107
SAB 107 regarding its interpretation of SFAS 123R. The standard requires
companies to expense on the grant-date the fair value of stock options and other
equity-based compensation issued to employees. In accordance with the revised
statement, the Company will be required to recognize the expense attributable to
stock options granted or vested in financial statement periods subsequent to
December 31, 2005. Based on unvested options outstanding at December 31, 2005,
the Company does not believe the adoption of FAS 123R will have a material
impact on its profitability.
In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations or FIN 47, that requires an entity to
recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation when
incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 clarifies that the
term Conditional Asset Retirement Obligation refers to a legal obligation to
perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of
settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the
control of the entity. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have
sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset
retirement obligation. The Company does not expect FIN 47 to have a material
impact on our results of operations.                   Page 36 TRAILER BRIDGE, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED December 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003 continued
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets
- -- an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 SFAS 153. This standard eliminates the
exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets to be measured
based on the fair value of the assets exchanged and replaced it with a general
exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial
substance. This standard is effective January 1, 2006. The Company does not
expect this standard to have a material impact on our results of operations or
financial condition.
In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections or SFAS 154, which supersedes APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes
and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements.
SFAS 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of
changes in accounting principle. The statement requires the retroactive
application to prior periods' financial statements of changes in accounting
principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific
effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 does not change the
guidance for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial
statements or the change in an accounting estimate. SFAS 154 is effective for
accounting changes and corrections or errors made in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 154 to
have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial
condition.

During the quarter ended June 30, 2002 the Company borrowed $5 million from an
affiliate, with interest at the rate of 803% a year. Certain stockholders of
the affiliate were also principal stockholders of the Company. The proceeds of
this borrowing were used to repay the $3 million borrowed under the revolving
credit agreement, and to provide $2 million in working capital. Amounts
outstanding were $4,933,205 at December 31, 2004. In April 2004, the $4,933,205
related party obligation was rescheduled from October 2004 to May 2007. In
connection with the Senior Secured debt offering, a portion of the proceeds was
used to payoff this obligation in December 2004. In addition during 2002, the
same affiliate purchased preferred convertible stock Series A for $2 million.
The preferred stock Series A, had a liquidation preference of $2 million. The
Preferred Stock Series A, pursuant to its terms was converted into 1,955,000
common shares in July of 2004. In April 2004, the $15 million deferred charter
hire obligation was combined with the $989,436 of advances into a $25 million
obligation payable over 36 months with interest at 803% a year. In connection
with the K-Corp acquisition, this debt was transferred to another affiliate and
remained an obligation of the Company as of December 31, 2005. On December 1, 2004 the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of K-Corp

In the first quarter of 2004, the Company received approval to reschedule
principal payments over the remaining life of each Title XI issue. As
rescheduled, the Company semi-annual principal payments increased to $232,022
and $372,429 respectively. In addition, in connection with obtaining the consent
of the Secretary of Transportation of the United States of America the
Secretary to offer and sell senior secured the notes, in December 2004 the
Company deposited approximately $20 million into a reserve fund that secures
the Title XI Bonds and during 2005 the Company deposited an additional $7
million. As of December 31, 2005, the Company is in default of the financial
covenants relating to certain leverage ratios contained in the Title XI debt
agreements. The default provisions of the Title XI covenants provide that, in
the event of default, the Company is restricted from conducting certain
financial activities without obtaining the written permission of the Secretary.
The Company may not take, without prior written approval, any of the following
actions: 1 acquire any fixed assets other than those required for the normal
maintenance of our existing assets; 2 enter into or become liable under
certain charters and leases having a term of six months or more; 3 pay any
debt subordinated to the Title XI Bonds; 4 incur any debt, except current
liabilities or short term loans incurred in the ordinary course of business; 5

deposits or investments in securities of the character permitted for money in
the reserve fund; or 6 create any lien on any of our assets, other than
pursuant to loans guaranteed by the Secretary under Title XI and liens incurred
in ordinary course of business. However, none of the foregoing restrictions will
apply at any time if the Company meets certain financial tests provided for in
the agreement and the Company has satisfied our obligation to make deposits into
the reserve fund. In November 2004, the Company received permission from the
Secretary to issue $85 million in Senior Secured Notes and to use the proceeds
of this transaction to fund the acquisition of K Corp., repay K Corp.
indebtedness, repay our existing debts, exercise certain equipment purchase
options on equipment previously leased. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has
not performed any such restricted financial activities and therefore, its in

Previously K-Corp leased to the Company two roll-on / roll-off barge vessels and
the use of a ramp system in San Juan, Puerto Rico. As a result of the purchase,
the Company has been able to improve its operations by eliminating the lease
agreements and replacing them with interest expense resulting from the notes on
the senior secured debt and depreciation expense of the acquired RO/RO vessels.
The Company paid $320 million and assumed debt of $91 million, which was paid
off on December 1, 2004. These obligations were paid with a portion of proceeds
of the senior secured debt. Certain pro-forma adjustments were made to eliminate
lease expense previously paid to K-Corp related to the RO/RO vessels, cumulative                   Page 40 TRAILER BRIDGE, INC.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences
between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income taxes.
The components of the Company net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2005 and
2004 are as follows                            2005         2004
Deferred tax assets:
Net operating loss carry forwards       $ 27,546,055      $ 31,026,256

Net deferred tax asset               $     -      $     -
The Company has recorded various deferred tax assets as reflected above. In
assessing the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, management considers,
whether it is more likely than not, that some portion, or the entire deferred
tax asset will be realized. The ultimate realization is dependent on generating
sufficient taxable income in future years. The valuation allowance account
decreased by $10,919,865 and $1,733,326 in 2005 and 2004 respectively as a
result of the Company being able to use its net operating loss carryforwards to
reduce taxable income and the difference in tax and book basis of the vessels
purchased in December 2004. The Company anticipates that its taxable temporary
differences will reverse in the same period as the deductible temporary
differences therefore assuring realization after non-reserved portion of its
deferred assets.
At December 31, 2005, the Company had available net operating loss NOL
carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $72,489,618, which expire
beginning in 2007.

Pursuant to EITF 03-06, the Company Series A convertible preferred shares
prior to their conversion to common shares were considered participating
securities. EITF 03-06 requires that each period income be allocated to
participating securities, if there is no conversion. Accordingly, for the
reporting periods in which there is income attributable to common shareholders,
the Company allocated a portion of such income to the Series A convertible
shareholders based upon the pro-rata share of income, weighted for the period
prior to redemption. During reporting periods in which there was a net loss
attributable to common shareholders, such loss is allocated entirely to the
common shares.

In March 1998, the Board of Directors authorized an Employee Stock Purchase
Plan, which covers substantially all employees. The Plan allows employees to
invest up to 10% of their base compensation through payroll deductions. The
purchase price will be 15% less than the fair market value on the last day of
the purchase period. The Company made contributions of approximately $515 to the
Plan during 2003. In accordance with the Plan document, the Plan terminated
automatically on March 1, 2004, the fifth anniversary of the Plan start date.
The Company has an Incentive Bonus Program; the Company made contributions of
$949,189 and $493,971 during 2005 and 2004 respectively, while no contributions
were made during 2003. Contributions are determined by the Company pre-tax
income.
13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is involved in litigation on a number of matters and is subject to
certain claims which arise in the normal course of business, none of which, in
the opinion of management, are expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Company financial positions or cash flows.
In 2006, the Company will complete the regulatory dry docking for both of the
RORO barges. The dry docking cost is estimated to range between $60 and $70
million. Upon completion, both RORO barges will be certified for an additional
five years.
14. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that
value Cash and Cash Equivalents - For those short-term instruments, the carrying
amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.
Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable- The carrying amounts of accounts
receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the relatively
short maturities.
Long Term Debt - Interest rates that are currently available to the Company for
issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to
estimate fair value for debt instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2005
the estimated fair value of the Company long-term debt were less than the
carrying values by approximately $997,266. This difference in the fair value and
the carrying value is based on the anticipated increase in the Company
prime-lending rate over the life of the Company fixed rate debt. 15. SEGMENTS
The Company primary business is to transport freight from its origination
point in the continental United States to San Juan, Puerto Rico and from San
Juan, Puerto Rico to its destination point in the continental United States. The
Company provides a domestic trucking system and a barge vessel system, which
work in conjunction with each other to service its customers.
While each of the services that the Company performs related to the
transportation of goods may be considered to be separate business activities,
the Company does not capture or report these activities separately because all
activities are considered part of the Company Intermodal Model for providing
customer service. Intermodal is a term used to represent the variety of
transportation services the Company provides to move products from one location
to another, including but not limited to air, water, land and rail. The Company
provides intermodal services to its customers from the continental United States                   Page 49 TRAILER BRIDGE, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED December 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003 continued
to San Juan, Puerto Rico. Customers are billed for the transportation of goods
from the point of origin to the final destination, and are not billed separately
for inland or marine transportation.
While the Company is able to track the expenses for these services separately,
the Company does not capture the revenues based on inland or marine
transportation because the results of revenues are not considered relevant to
the model currently employed by the Company. Instead the management and
directors of the Company make operating and reporting decisions based on the
total results of operations.
16. CONCENTRATION OF GEOGRAPHIC MARKET RISK
The Company transports freight between the Continental United States and Puerto
Rico for companies in diversified industries who have operations located there.
There is no one customer that comprises over 10% of the Company total revenues.
The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of the customer financial
condition and as a condition of the extension of credit the customer agrees that
the Company shall have the right to exercise a lien against any shipment
tendered. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, accounts receivable was approximately
$151 million and $156 million respectively. Receivables are generally due
within 45 days. Credit losses have been within management expectations. The
Company leases its tug charter from a single vendor, however the Company
believes this risk is mitigated by the availability of tugboat providers
currently in the market.                   Page 50 TRAILER BRIDGE, INC.

Trailer Bridge, Inc. Prior to the acquisition, the Company leased two RO/RO vessels and a ramp system in San Juan,
Puerto Rico. The Company financed this acquisition with a portion of the proceeds of the $ 85 million senior secured notes
with a 9 1/4% fixed interest rate. This transaction was accretive in that the Company reduced its operating lease expense
payments to K-Corp and incurred additional interest and depreciation which together resulted in a $213,591 increase in
operating income for the month of December 2004. In connection with the $85 million senior secured notes, the Company paid
off its existing credit facility which resulted in the write off of deferred loan costs of $381,523 in December 2004 , which
increased interest expense and decreased net income of the same amount. Further, in connection with the acquisition of
K-Corp, the Company redeemed the Preferred Stock Series B. In accordance with EITF D-42, the $456,298 excess of 1 fair
value of the consideration transferred to the holders of the preferred stock over 2 the carrying amount of the preferred
stock in the Company balance sheet was subtracted from net earnings to arrive at net earnings available to common
shareholders in the calculation of earnings per share.
2  In June 2004, the Company received a favorable legal determination regarding the Volume of Business Tax in the Guaynabo
Municipality of Puerto Rico, which resulted in a $250,000 reversal, which increased operating income by the same amount.                   Page 51                   SCHEDULE II - VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS
