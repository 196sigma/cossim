NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION
During fiscal 1996, the Company entered into definitive agreements to sell
its Graphic Systems business to an affiliate of Stonington Partners, Inc. and to
merge the A Business with a subsidiary of Boeing. The Graphic Systems business
was sold in October 1996 for approximately $600 million. The merger of the
Company A Business with Boeing was completed in December 1996. The Graphic
Systems business and the A Business are reflected in the financial statements
as discontinued operations for all periods presented see Note 3.
The A Business was merged with a subsidiary of Boeing in a tax-free
transaction valued at approximately $32 billion, including the assumption by
Boeing of approximately $23 billion of liabilities, principally debt. Boeing
issued approximately $860 million of its stock in exchange for the Company
shareowners' interest in the A Business.
Immediately prior to the merger, the Company transferred its Automation,
Avionics & Communications, Semiconductor Systems, and Automotive businesses to a
new company New Rockwell, which has retained the Rockwell name, and is
reflected in the financial statements as the continuing operations of Rockwell
for all periods presented. Shares of New Rockwell were distributed to the
Company shareowners on the effective date of the transaction on a one-for-one
share basis.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles which require management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform with the current presentation.
Except as indicated, amounts reflected in the financial statements or
disclosed in the notes to financial statements relate to the Company
continuing operations.
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost using LIFO, FIFO, or average
methods or market determined on the basis of estimated realizable values.
Property
Property is stated at cost. Depreciation of property is provided based on
estimated useful lives generally using accelerated and straight-line methods.
Significant renewals and betterments are capitalized and replaced units are
written off. Maintenance and repairs, as well as renewals of minor amount, are
charged to expense.
Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the
fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition and is amortized by
the straight-line method over periods ranging from 10 to 40 years. Trademarks,
patents, product technology, and other intangibles are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 5 to 40
years.
Management reviews periodically the realizability of goodwill and other
intangible assets based on an evaluation of remaining useful lives, cash flows,
and profitability projections and has determined that there is no impairment at
September 30, 1996.
22
23
Environmental Matters
The Company records accruals for environmental issues in the accounting
period in which its responsibility is established and the cost can be reasonably
estimated. At environmental sites in which more than one potentially responsible
party has been identified, the Company records a liability for its allocable
share of costs related to its involvement with the site as well as an allocable
share of costs related to insolvent parties or unidentified shares. At
environmental sites in which the Company is the only responsible party, the
Company records a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation before
consideration of recovery from insurers or other third parties. If recovery from
a third party is determined to be probable, the Company records a receivable for
the estimated recovery.
Earnings Per Share
Earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during each year. The computation does not include a
negligible dilutive effect of stock options.
New Accounting Standards
The company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and For Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of. The adoption of this standard did not have a material
effect on the financial statements.
In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, which is effective for fiscal
year 1997. Under SFAS No. 123, companies can elect, but are not required, to
recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards, using a fair value
methodology. The Company expects to implement in fiscal year 1997 the disclosure
only provisions, as permitted by SFAS No. 123.
In October 1996, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued Statement of Position No. 96-1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities,
which is effective for fiscal year 1998. The Company does not expect adoption of
this statement to have a material effect on the financial statements.
3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Discontinued operations includes the Graphic Systems business and the A
Business see Note 1. The assets and liabilities of the A Business have been
classified on the balance sheet as net liabilities of the A Business and
consist of the following in millions:

Pursuant to the merger agreement, in addition to the A Business, Boeing
acquired certain Rockwell corporate property and United States pension plan
assets and assumed pension obligations related to certain
23
24
former employees of the continuing businesses see Note 15. Boeing also assumed
$2,165 million of the short- and long-term domestic borrowings of the Company
see Notes 8 and 10. Accordingly, these amounts have been presented on the
balance sheet as net liabilities of the A Business. The net liabilities of the
A Business at the date of this transaction have been recorded as an increase
to additional paid-in capital in fiscal year 1997.
The assets and liabilities of the Graphic Systems business have been
classified on the balance sheet as net assets of Graphic Systems and consist of
the following in millions:
SEPTEMBER 30,

The net income loss from operations of the A Business and the Graphic
Systems business has been reflected on the statement of income as income from
discontinued operations. Summarized results of discontinued operations are as
follows in millions:
YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,

Net income    178    7    212    37    266    17
The net loss for Graphic Systems for the year ended September 30, 1996
includes net income from operations of $3 million offset by a provision for loss
on the sale of $10 million.
The Graphic Systems business and the A Business utilized certain services
which are provided for all of the Company businesses on a centralized basis,
including payroll administration, data processing, and telecommunications
services. These businesses were also allocated costs of centrally administered
programs, including employee medical claims and property and casualty insurance.
These costs were charged to businesses based on actual usage of these services
and programs and were $107 million, $150 million, and $180 million in 1996,
1995, and 1994, respectively.
These businesses also received other services provided by the Company,
including financial, legal, tax, corporate communications, and human resources.
The costs of these services are allowable overhead costs on government contracts
and, accordingly, have been included in the results of operations of the A
Business. These costs have been allocated to the A Business using a variety of
factors, including sales, assets, inventory, and payroll and were $35 million 32 million, and $40 million in 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively. Management
believes that the methods of allocating costs to these businesses are
reasonable.
Interest expense of $159 million, $142 million, and $75 million in 1996,
1995, and 1994, respectively, has been allocated to the A Business based on
the actual interest expense associated with the borrowings assumed by Boeing.
24
25
4. RESTRUCTURING
During 1996, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $122 million
before tax $77 million after tax, or 35 cents per share. The restructuring
charges relate to a decision to exit non-strategic product lines involving
certain truck communications and intelligent transportation products, as well as
the costs associated with staff reductions in several businesses.
The provision includes asset impairments of $71 million, severance and
other employee costs of $35 million, and contractual commitments and other costs
of $16 million. As of September 30, 1996, the Company had expended $11 million
related to these actions, which are expected to be completed by the end of 1997.
5. ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES
In September 1996, the Company acquired Brooktree, a designer and
manufacturer of digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits for computer
graphics, multimedia, imaging, and communications applications, for $278
million. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase as of September 30,
1996 and the price allocation included a write-off of $121 million for purchased
research and development. The Company also acquired several other businesses in
1996 at a net cost of $68 million. Pro forma information is not presented as the
results of operations of Brooktree and the other acquisitions are not material
in relation to the Company income from continuing operations.
In January 1995, the Company completed its acquisition of Reliance, a major
manufacturer of industrial products and telecommunications equipment, for $1,066
million, net of proceeds from the sale of Reliance telecommunications
business. The acquisition of Reliance was accounted for as a purchase as of
December 31, 1994 and the results of operations, exclusive of the divested
telecommunications business, have been included in the statement of income since
that date.
The following unaudited pro forma information has been prepared assuming
Reliance had been acquired as of the beginning of the years presented. The pro
forma information is presented for informational purposes and is not necessarily
indicative of what would have occurred if the acquisition had been made as of
those dates. The pro forma information is not intended to be a projection of
future results.

11. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company financial instruments include cash, short- and long-term
debt, and foreign currency forward exchange contracts. At September 30, 1996,
the carrying values of the Company financial instruments approximated their
fair values based on current market prices and rates.
It is the policy of the Company not to enter into derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes. The Company does enter into foreign
currency forward exchange contracts to protect itself from adverse currency rate
fluctuations on foreign currency commitments entered into in the ordinary course
of business. These commitments are generally for terms of less than one year.
The foreign currency forward exchange contracts are executed with creditworthy
banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. The
notional amount of all of the Company outstanding foreign currency forward
exchange contracts aggregated $919 million and $681 million at September 30,
1996 and 1995, respectively. The Company does not anticipate any material
adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position relating to
these foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
12. CAPITAL STOCK
At September 30, 1996, the authorized stock of the Company consisted of 600
million shares of Common Stock and 200 million shares of Class A Common Stock,
each with a $1 par value, and 12 million shares of preferred stock without par
value. The Class A Common Stock was substantially identical to the Common Stock
except that each share of Class A Common Stock entitled the holder to ten votes
on all matters on which holders of Common Stock were entitled to vote, was not
transferable except in certain limited circumstances, and was convertible at any
time into Common Stock on a share-for-share basis. At September 30, 1996, 26
million shares of common stock were reserved for various employee incentive
plans.
In 1996, 117,821 shares of Series A and Series B preferred stock were
converted into common stock. The remaining 9,892 shares were redeemed by the
Company at prices of $10000 per share for the Series A stock and $3600 per
share for the Series B stock.

As a result of the Reorganization, the Company is authorized to issue
1,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 100,000,000 shares of Class A Common
Stock, each with a $1 par value, and 25,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock
without par value. Shareowners of the Company received one share of New Rockwell
Common Stock and Class A Common Stock for each share held of Rockwell Common
Stock and Class A Common Stock, respectively, in connection with the
Reorganization. The terms of the New Rockwell Common Stock and Class A Common
Stock are substantially the same as those of the Rockwell Common Stock and Class
A Common Stock. Associated with each share of New Rockwell Common Stock and
Class A Common Stock is a Preferred Share Purchase Right Right pursuant to
which the holder of each such share of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock
may, in certain takeover-related circumstances, become entitled to purchase from
the Company 1/100 of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at
a price of $250. The terms and conditions of the Rights are set forth in a
Rights Agreement dated as of November 30, 1996 between the Company and
ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C., as Rights Agent. The New Rockwell
Class A Common Stock will be automatically converted into New Rockwell Common
Stock on February 23, 1997.

2006. None of the incentive plans presently permits options to be granted after
July 10, 2006.
In connection with the Reorganization, stock options of Rockwell were
converted into stock options of New Rockwell. The number of options and exercise
price of each option were adjusted to preserve the aggregate intrinsic value of
the options.
14. RETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS
The Company has retirement medical plans which cover most of its United
States employees and provide for the payment of medical costs of eligible
employees and dependents upon retirement.

Health care cost trend     80%*   85 
* Decreasing to 55% after 2015
Retirement medical liabilities related to current and former employees of
the A Business of $1,453 million and $1,516 million are included in net
liabilities of the A Business at September 30, 1996 and 1995, respectively, as
Boeing assumed such liabilities in connection with the Reorganization.
Changing the health care cost trend rates by one percentage point would
change the accumulated retirement medical obligation at September 30, 1996 by
approximately $79 million and would change retirement medical expense by
approximately $8 million.
15. RETIREMENT PENSION PLANS
The Company has pension plans which cover most of its employees and provide
for monthly pension payments to eligible employees upon retirement. Pension
benefits for salaried employees generally are based on years of credited service
and average earnings. Pension benefits for hourly employees generally are based
on specified benefit amounts and years of service.
Net pension expense for continuing operations consisted of the following
in millions:
1996   1995   1994
Service cost--benefits earned during the year. $ 80   $ 65   $ 60
Interest accrued on projected benefit obligation.  284    269    238

Net actuarial loss    35    16    36
Net pension  $ 113   $ 86   $ 83
Pension plan assets are primarily equity securities, United States
Government obligations, and fixed income investments whose values are subject to
fluctuations of the securities market. The actual return on
29
30
plan assets allocated to continuing operations was $627 million, $511 million,
and $52 million in 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively. Differences between these
actual returns and the related assumed returns on plan assets are deferred and
considered in the determination of net pension income or expense in future
periods.
Pension plan obligations attributable to United States active employees of
continuing businesses as of January 1, 1996 and a proportionate share of pension
plan assets were transferred prior to the Reorganization from the Company
United States pension plan to a newly-established New Rockwell pension plan.
Pension plan assets and obligations related to employees of the A Business and
all retirees of the Company United States pension plan prior to January 1,
1996 have been classified as net liabilities of the A Business as the
remainder of the Company United States pension plan was retained by the A
Business pursuant to the merger agreement with Boeing.
The following table reconciles the funded status of the assets and
liabilities attributable to the New Rockwell pension plan and the Company
other overfunded pension plans to amounts recorded in the balance sheet in

The components of the provision for income taxes are as follows in
millions:
1996   1995   1994
Current:
United  $ 364   $202   $138
Research and experimentation   65   --        102    81    77

State and   15   6   10
Total   124   7   27
Provision for income  $ 341   $318   $217
In July 1996, the Company reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue
Service concerning its research and experimentation tax credit refund claim for
the years 1981 though 1991. The settlement, pursuant to which the Company will
receive approximately $65 million, is subject to the approval of the Joint
Congressional Committee on Taxation.
Net deferred income tax benefits included in the balance sheet at September
30, 1996 and 1995 consist of the tax effects of temporary differences related to
the following in millions:
1996   1995
Accrued compensation and  $105   $ 80
Accrued product   83    79
38    1
80    64
Current deferred income  $306   $222
Net deferred income taxes included in Other Liabilities in the balance
sheet at September 30, 1996 and 1995 consist of the tax effects of temporary
differences related to the following in millions:
1996   1995
Retirement  $315  $340
201    221

9    121
132    15
Valuation   134    96
Long-term deferred income  $  2   $ 111
Management believes it is more likely than not that current and long-term
tax assets will be realized through the reduction of future taxable income.
Significant factors considered by management in its determination of the
probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets included: a the
historical operating results of the Company $15 billion of United States
income from continuing operations before income taxes over the past three
years, b expectations of future earnings, and c the extended period of time
over which the retirement medical liability will be paid. The valuation
allowance represents the amount
31
32
of tax benefits related to net operating loss, capital loss and foreign tax
credit carryforwards that have not yet been recognized. The carryforward period
for net operating losses expires between 1997 and 2004. The carryforward period
for foreign tax credits expires between 1997 and 2001. The tax benefit of a
capital loss carryforward resulting from the sale of Reliance
telecommunications business was recorded during 1996 and is substantially offset
by a valuation allowance.
The consolidated effective tax rate was different from the United States
statutory rate for the reasons set forth below:
1996   1995   1994
Statutory tax  350%  350%  350%
State and local income  36   31   27
Foreign income  12   28   37
Non-deductible  14   21    9
Utilization of foreign loss  9   20  19
Purchased research and  47    --    Research and experimentation  72   --      2   18  22
Effective tax  380%  392%  382%
The income tax provisions were calculated based upon the following
components of income from continuing operations before income taxes in
millions:
1996   1995   1994
United States  $545   $545   $374
Foreign   351   266   194
$896   $811   $568
No provision has been made for United States, state, or additional foreign
income taxes related to approximately $532 million of undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently
reinvested.
The Company United States income tax returns for the years 1989 through
1991 are currently under examination. Pursuant to the merger agreement with
Boeing, the Company has retained all tax liabilities and the right to all tax
refunds related to operations of the A Business for periods prior to the
merger. Management believes that adequate provision for income taxes has been
made for all years through 1996.

18. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Claims have been asserted against the Company for utilizing the
intellectual property rights of others in certain of the Company products. The
resolution of these matters may result in the negotiation of a license
agreement, a settlement or the legal resolution of such claims. The Company
accrues the estimated cost of disposition of these matters. Management believes
that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on
the Company financial statements.
Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be
instituted or asserted against the Company relating to the conduct of its
business, including those pertaining to product liability, safety and health,
environmental, and employment matters. The Company has agreed to indemnify
Boeing and the A Business for certain government contract and environmental
matters related to operations of the A Business for periods prior to the
merger. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty
and some lawsuits, claims, or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to the
Company, management believes the disposition of matters which are pending or
asserted will not have a material adverse effect on the Company financial
statements.
