CYBERSOURCE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The Company CyberSource Corporation
CyberSource or the Company provides secure electronic payment and risk management solutions to organizations that process orders for goods and services over the Internet. CyberSources payment solutions allow eCommerce
merchants to accept a wide range of online payment options, from credit cards and electronic checks, to global payment options and emerging payment types. The Companys risk and compliance management tools address complexities common to online
merchants such as credit card fraud, online tax requirements and export controls. The Companys reporting and management tools facilitate the automation of the flow of complex eCommerce processes, such as recurring billing and payment
reconciliation. The Company partners with and connects to a large network of payment processors and other payment service providers to offer merchants a single source solution. Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the financial
position and results of operations of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Foreign Currency Translation The financial statements of the Companys non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S.
dollars in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No52, Foreign Currency Translation. Assets and liabilities of the Companys subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the
end of the period. Revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates in effect during the period. Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in other comprehensive income loss. Gains and losses realized from foreign
currency transactions denominated in currencies other than the subsidiarys functional currency were not material through December31, 2005 and were approximately $01 million in losses for the year ended December31, 2006.
Use of Estimates The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition The Company derives its revenues from monthly commerce transaction processing
fees, support service fees, professional services and the sale of enterprise software licenses and related maintenance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No104, Revenue Recognition SAB
104 and Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2, as amended. SAB 104 and SOP 97-2 require that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: 1persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists; 2delivery has occurred or services rendered; 3the fee is fixed or determinable; and 4collectibility is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria 4is based on managements judgments
regarding the collectibility of those fees. Transaction revenues are recognized in the period in which the transactions occur. The Company
derives a significant portion of its transaction processing revenues from global acquiring fees charged to merchants for payment processing services. The Companys fees, which are primarily a percentage of the dollar amount of each transaction
processed, are based upon the merchants monthly charge volume and risk profile. In addition, the Company records revenues for miscellaneous services related to global acquiring, such as fees for processing credit card chargebacks. In
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent EITF 99-19, the Company recognizes these fees on a gross basis as it is the primary agent in the transaction in the period
the merchants transactions are processed. Related interchange fees paid to card issuing banks and assessments paid to credit card associations are recognized in cost of revenues at that time. Professional services revenue and support service fees are recognized as the related services are provided and costs are incurred. The Company recognizes
software license revenue in the period in which the contract is signed, the software is delivered and the fee is collectible. The Company uses the residual method of accounting as permitted by Statement of Position 98-9 SOP 98-9 to
recognize revenue when a software license includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence VSOE exists for all undelivered elements. The Company allocates revenue to each element
based upon its fair value as determined by VSOE. The Company defers revenue for any undelivered elements and recognizes the deferred revenue when the product is delivered or over the period in which the service is performed. 
34 Table of Contents CYBERSOURCE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The Company derives its professional services revenue from time and material contracts and
fixed-price contracts, which require the accurate estimation of the cost, scope and duration of each engagement. Revenue and the related costs for these projects are generally recognized as those services are delivered. Estimates are made regarding
percent complete based on original hours budgeted and projected hours to complete the projects and revisions to estimates are reflected in the period in which changes become known. The Company has not had significant losses on professional services
engagements to date. Provisions are provided for sales returns and are based on historical experience and other known factors. For the
years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term
Investments The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity from the date of purchase of three months or
less to be cash equivalents. As of December31, 2006 and 2005, cash equivalents consist primarily of investments in money market funds. Short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair market value. Short-term investments are primarily composed of government and corporate bonds with an original maturity greater than three months and less
than one year. Also included in short-term investments are approximately $61 million in auction rate securities with final maturities ranging from 28 to 40 years. Although some maturities may extend beyond one year, these securities are available
to be used for current operations and therefore, are classified as short-term investments as all of the Companys auction rate securities have auction dates within one year of the prior auction date. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments consist of the following as of December31, 2006 and 2005 in thousands:  CarryingValue

Net unrealized losses on short-term investments, which represent the difference between the fair
market value and the amortized cost, were $27,000 as of December31, 2006 and $48,000 as of December31, 2005. There were no realized gains or losses from the sale of short-term investments during fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments
that potentially subject the Company and its subsidiaries to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are invested in major financial institutions in the United States. Such deposits may be in excess of
insured limits and are not insured in other jurisdictions. Management believes that the financial institutions that hold the Companys investments are financially sound and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these
investments. The accounts receivable of the Company and its subsidiaries are derived from sales to customers located primarily in the
United States and Europe. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers. The Company generally does not require collateral. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined with respect to those amounts that the Company has determined to be doubtful of collection. At December31, 2006 and 2005, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Companys
accounts receivable balance. At December31, 2006 and 2005, the percentage of accounts receivable due from foreign customers was 15% and 12%, respectively. The Company has no off-balance-sheet concentration of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts or other hedging arrangements. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated on a
straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease terms or the estimated useful lives. Depreciation expense was $14 million, $08 million and
$11 million for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Property and equipment consist of the following in
thousands:  December31 2006

Furniture and fixtures 2,027 1,731

Less accumulated depreciation and amortization 27,132 26,210 3,618 2,542 Product Development Product development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred. SFAS No86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed, requires capitalization of
certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility. Based on the Companys product development process, technological feasibility is established upon the completion of a working model. To date, costs
incurred by the Company between the completion of the working model and the point at which the product is ready for general release have been insignificant. Accordingly, the Company has charged all such costs to product development expense in the
period incurred. Advertising Expense The cost of advertising is recorded as an expense when incurred. Advertising costs were approximately $54,000, $10,000 and $01 million during the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Prior to the January1, 2006 adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No123R, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation using Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 
Transition and Disclosure SFAS 148. SFAS 148 required disclosure of the effects of an entitys accounting policy with respect to stock-based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and
interim financial statements. As permitted under SFAS 148, the Company adopted the disclosure only provisions and continued to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting for employee stock options in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25. Effective January1, 2006, the
beginning of the Companys first fiscal quarter of 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified-prospective transition method. Under this transition method, stock-based compensation expense
was recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Compensation expense recognized included the estimated expense for stock options granted on and subsequent to January1, 2006, based on the fair value at grant date estimated in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R, and the estimated expense for the portion vesting during 2006, for options granted prior to, but not vested as of January1, 2006, based on the fair value at grant date estimated in accordance with
the original provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123. Results for prior periods have not been restated, as provided for under the
modified-prospective method. Total stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2006 was $47 million before income taxes. As a result of adopting SFAS 123R, the Companys income before income taxes and net income, reduced by the expense for stock option awards, for the
year ended December31, 2006, were both $47 million lower than if it had continued to account for stock-based compensation under APB 25. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December31, 2006 would have been $014 and
$013 higher, respectively, if the Company had not adopted SFAS No123R. The following table shows the effect on net earnings and
earnings per share for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004 had compensation cost been recognized based upon the estimated fair value on the grant date of stock options, and employee stock purchase plan ESPP shares, in

There are 1,900,000 shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 1998 Option Plan. The 1998 Option Plan
provides for the issuance of common stock and the granting of options to employees, officers, directors, consultants, independent contractors, and advisors of the Company. The exercise price of a nonqualifying stock option and an incentive stock
option shall not be less than 85% and 100%, respectively, of the fair value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Options granted under the 1998 Option Plan generally become exercisable over four years at the rate of 25%per year from
the grant date. In January 1999, the Company adopted its 1999 Stock Option Plan the 1999 Option Plan. The Company has
reserved a total of 11,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 1999 Option Plan. The provisions of the 1999 Option Plan are similar to those of the 1998 Option Plan. In May 2004, the Company reserved 2,000,000 additional shares of
common stock under the 1999 Option Plan. In May 2006, the Company reserved 2,000,000 additional shares of common stock under the 1999 Option Plan. 
37 Table of Contents CYBERSOURCE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
In October 1999, the Company adopted the 1999 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan the 1999
Nonqualified Option Plan. The Company has reserved a total of 1,737,500 shares of common stock for issuance under the 1999 Nonqualified Option Plan. The 1999 Nonqualified Option Plan provides for the granting of non-qualified stock options to
employees, consultants and directors. The other provisions of the 1999 Nonqualified Option Plan are similar to those of the 1999 and 1998 Stock Option Plans. In September 2000, the Company assumed the PaylinX Stock Option Plan as a result of its acquisition of PaylinX Corporation in September 2000. During 2004, the Company retired the unissued shares available for grant.
Options previously granted under this plan that have not yet expired or otherwise become unexercisable continue to be administered under such plan, and any portions that expire or become unexercisable for any reason shall be canceled and be
unavailable for future issuance. Stock options to purchase the Companys common stock are granted at prices equal to the fair market
value on the date of grant. Options generally vest monthly over a four year period beginning from the date of grant and generally expire six to tenyears from the date of grant. Options granted to non-employee directors generally become vested
nine months from the date of grant. Nearly all outstanding stock options are non-qualified stock options. As of December31, 2006, 166million shares are authorized for issuance under the Companys stock option plans.

For stock options granted during 2006, 2005 and 2004, and ESPP shares purchased during 2005 and 2004,
the Company determined the fair value at the date of grant or purchase using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and the following weighted average assumptions:  YearEndedDecember31 2006
2005 2004 Stock options Risk-free interest rate
464%-475 437 343 Dividend yield Volatility
058-064
060 075 Expected life years
296
397 4 Employee stock purchase plan shares Risk-free interest rate 350 161 Dividend yield Volatility 044 075 Expected life months 6 6
The expected life of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is
based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of the Companys
stock over the expected life of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining expected life. The Company has not paid dividends in the past and does not plan
to pay any dividends in the near future. The weighted average fair value of options granted was $480, $281 and $286 per share for
options granted during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The weighted average fair value for shares purchased under the Companys ESPP was $033 and $144 per share during 2005 and 2004, respectively. In July 2005, the Company amended the
ESPP, permitting eligible employees to authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their base compensation to purchase shares of the Companys common stock at 95% of the fair market value of the common stock on the purchase date. As a result
of this amendment and the provisions of SFAS 123R, shares granted under the ESPP are non-compensatory. As of December31, 2006, 700,000 shares are authorized for issuance under the ESPP. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The assumptions used to
calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and the Companys experience. Options granted are valued using the single option valuation approach, and the resulting expense is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the option. Compensation expense is recognized only for those options expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on the Companys historical experience
and future expectations. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the effect of forfeitures on the pro forma expense amounts was recognized as the forfeitures occurred. As of December31, 2006, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock options was approximately $118million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average
period of approximately 29 years. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was approximately $69 million, $35 million and $50 million, respectively. During 2006, the total cash received from the exercise
of stock options was approximately $47 million. During 2006, the Company granted 100,000 restricted shares at a weighted average grant
date fair value of $1046. No shares have vested as of December31, 2006. Employee Stock Purchase Plan In June 1999, the Companys Board of Directors and stockholders adopted the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP and reserved 500,000
shares of common stock for issuance under this plan. In accordance with Section423 of the Internal Revenue Code, this plan permitted eligible employees to authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their base compensation to purchase shares
of the Companys common stock at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of the offering period or the purchase date. In July 2005, the Company amended the ESPP, permitting eligible employees to authorize
payroll deductions of up to 10% of their base compensation to purchase shares of the Companys 
39 Table of Contents CYBERSOURCE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
common stock at 95% of the fair market value of the common stock on the purchase date. In May 2004, the Company reserved an additional 200,000 shares of
common stock for issuance under the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company issued 15,113 shares of common stock to employees under the terms of the plan. As of December31, 2006, 146,416
shares remain available for purchase under the plan. In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No123R-3,
Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards FSP 123R-3. The Company has elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share-based
compensation pursuant to FAS123R-3. The alternative transition method includes a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool related to the effects of employee share-based compensation.
Long-Lived Assets Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144 requires that the Company perform tests for impairment of its intangible assets other than goodwill
annually and more frequently whenever events or circumstances suggest that its intangible assets may be impaired. As of December31, 2006, the Company had recorded intangible assets related to our acquisition of BidPay.com BidPay
in March 2006, with a carrying value of approximately $30 million. To evaluate potential impairment, SFAS 144 requires the Company to assess whether the future cash flows related to these assets will be greater than their carrying value at the time
of the test. Accordingly, while the Companys cash flow assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates it is using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to its
intangible assets over their respective estimated useful lives. Net Income Per Share In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No128, Earnings Per Share, basic and diluted net income per share has
been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Income Taxes Income taxes are calculated under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No109, Accounting for Income Taxes
SFAS 109. Under SFAS 109, the liability method is used in accounting for income taxes, which includes the effects of temporary differences between financial and taxable amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the effects of net
operating loss and credit carryforwards to determine deferred tax assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to more likely than not be realized. Prior to the
fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of its deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding its ability to realize these assets. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $31 million which included a $32 million reduction in
the Companys valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $110 million which included a $99 million reduction in the Companys
valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. These determinations were based on projected taxable income. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss
The Companys comprehensive income loss consists of its net income and other comprehensive income loss, including unrealized
gains or losses on available for sale securities and foreign currency translation gains or losses. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation Number 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48, an
interpretation of SFAS 109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15,
2006 and as a result is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of FIN 48 could have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
40 Table of Contents CYBERSOURCE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS
157, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company must adopt these new requirements no later than the first quarter of 2008. The Company has not yet
determined the effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements, if any, upon adoption of SFAS 157, or if it will adopt the requirements prior to the first fiscal quarter of 2008. In September2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements SAB 108. The intent of SAB 108 is to reduce diversity in practice for the method companies use to quantify financial statement misstatements, including the effect of
prior year uncorrected errors. SAB 108 establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors using both an income statement and a cumulative balance sheet approach. SAB 108 is effective for annual financial statements
for fiscal years ending after November15, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 is not currently expected to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 2.BidPay.com Acquisition In March 2006, the
Company acquired BidPay.com, Inc. BidPay, a payment service provider for online auctions. The Companys primary reason for the acquisition of BidPay is to expand its services into the payment market for online auctions. The
aggregate purchase price of approximately $30 million consisted of cash consideration of approximately $20 million, including $02 million of acquisition costs, and $10 million in deferred taxes related to the difference between the financial and
tax basis of the assets acquired, in exchange for BidPays proprietary technology, its databases, and certain intellectual property rights, including exclusive rights to the BidPay brand. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force 98-3, Determining Whether a Nonmonetary Transaction Involves Receipt of Productive Assets or of a
Business, the Company determined that it had acquired productive assets as opposed to a business. As a result, no amount of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill. The total purchase price of $30 million was allocated based on the fair

make decisions about how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Companys chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer. The Company views its operations as principally three segments, Commerce transaction services
and support, enterprise software and professional services and manages the business based on the revenues and cost of revenues of these segments. Additionally, revenues from outside the United States were 100%, 96% and 94% of total revenues for
the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. For the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, no customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues. The following tables present revenues and cost of revenues by the Companys three reportable segments for the years ended December31, 2006,
2005 and 2004. There were no inter-business unit sales or transfers. The Company does not report operating expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest income expense, income taxes, capital expenditures, or identifiable assets by its segments

re-evaluated its future facility needs and determined that its forecasted growth would require the utilization of the unoccupied space in its Mountain View, California facility beginning in 2005. As a result, the Company decided to no longer market
the available space at its Mountain View, California facility, and extended its lease on this facility through December 2011. As a result, the Company reversed the remaining $15 million balance of previously recorded restructuring charges related
to this facility. 6.Investment in Joint Venture On March1, 2000, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Japanese partners Marubeni Corporation and Trans-Cosmos, Inc. to establish CyberSource K.K. to provide commerce transaction services to
the Japanese market. The Company will maintain a majority controlling interest in CyberSource K.K., subject to certain veto rights granted to the partners, which will expire when CyberSource K.K. achieves at least $20 million in quarterly revenue.
The joint venture is being accounted for under the equity method of accounting until the veto rights granted to the partners as described above expire. After such date, in accordance with the joint venture agreement, the Company will consolidate the
financial position and results of operations of CyberSource K.K. As of December31, 2005, the Company had recognized losses to the extent of its historical investment. In 2006, the Company recognized joint venture income of approximately
$41,000. 7.Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are as follows in thousands:  YearEndedDecember31 2006 2005 Cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment 25 391 Unrealized loss on short-term investments 27 48 Accumulated other comprehensive loss 52 439 8.Commitments The Company leases its primary facility and certain equipment under noncancelable operating leases.

$04 million, $05 million and $05 million, respectively, were paid to Morrison Foerster LLP, a law firm in which a director of the Company is a partner. As of December31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had immaterial amounts of
accounts payable due to Morrison Foerster LLP. The terms of the Companys contracts with the above-related parties are
consistent with its contracts with other independent parties. 12.Litigation and Contingencies In July and August 2001, various class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, against the Company,
its Chairman and CEO, a former officer, and four brokerage firms that served as underwriters in its initial public offering.The actions were filed on behalf of persons who purchased the Companys stock issued pursuant to or traceable to
the initial public offering during the period from June23, 1999 through December6, 2000.The action alleges that the Companys underwriters charged secret excessive commissions to certain of their customers in return for
allocations of the Companys stock in the offering.The two individual defendants are alleged to be liable because of their involvement in preparing and signing the registration statement for the offering, which allegedly failed to
disclose the supposedly excessive commissions.
44 Table of Contents CYBERSOURCE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
On December7, 2001, an amended complaint was filed in one of the actions to expand the purported class to persons who purchased the Companys
stock issued pursuant to or traceable to the follow-on public offering during the period from November4, 1999 through December6, 2000.The lawsuit filed against the Company is one of several hundred lawsuits filed against other
companies based on substantially similar claims.On April19, 2002, a consolidated amended complaint was filed to consolidate all of the complaints and claims into one case.The consolidated amended complaint alleges claims that are
virtually identical to the amended complaint filed on December7, 2001 and the original complaints.In October 2002, the Companys officer and a former officer that were named in the amended complaint were dismissed without
prejudice.In July 2002, the Company, along with other issuer defendants in the case, filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint with prejudice.On February19, 2003, the court issued a written decision denying the
motion to dismiss with respect to CyberSource and the individual defendants.On July2, 2003, a committee of the Companys Board of Directors conditionally approved a proposed partial settlement with the plaintiffs in this
matter.The settlement would provide, among other things, a release of the Company and of the individual defendants for the conduct alleged in the action to be wrongful in the Amended Complaint.The Company would agree to undertake other
responsibilities under the partial settlement, including agreeing to assign away, not assert, or release certain potential claims it may have against its underwriters.The committee agreed to approve the settlement subject to a number of
conditions, including the participation of a substantial number of other Issuer Defendants in the proposed settlement, the consent of the Companys insurers to the settlement, and the completion of acceptable final settlement
documentation.On August31, 2005, the court issued a formal preliminary approval for the settlement.On April24, 2006, a hearing was held for the court to consider the motion for final approval of the settlement.On
December5, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit the Second Circuit issued an opinion vacating the District Court certification of a litigation class in that portion of the case between the Plaintiffs and the
underwriter defendants.Because the Second Circuit opinion was directed to the class certified by the District Court for the Plaintiffs' litigation against the underwriter defendants, the opinion effect on the class certified by the
District Court for the Company settlement is unclear.On January5, 2007, Plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing to the full panel of the Second Circuit.The proposed settlement is pending final approval by the District
Court.There can be no assurance that the settlement will be approved and, because of the inherent uncertainties of litigation, the Company cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of the case if it is not. However, any direct financial
impact of the proposed settlement is expected to be borne by the Company insurers. On August11, 2004, the Company filed suit in the
Northern District of California against Retail Decisions, Inc. ReD US and Retail Decisions Plc ReD UK collectively, ReD, Case No3:04-CIV-03268, alleging that ReD infringes the Companys U.S.
Patent No6,029,154 the 154 Patent. The Company served ReD US with the complaint on August12, 2004, and the Company served ReD UK with the complaint on August13, 2004. On September30, 2004, ReD responded
to the Companys complaint. ReD filed a motion to stay the case for 90 days pending a determination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office PTO as to whether it will grant ReDs request that the PTO re-examine the 154
Patent. ReD also filed a motion for a more definite statement by the Company with respect to its allegation that ReD is willfully infringing the 154 Patent. In addition, ReD UK filed a motion to dismiss the action against it on the ground that
it is not subject to personal jurisdiction in the Northern District of California. On October27, 2004, ReD filed a request for re-examination with the PTO, based on prior art ReD discovered that allegedly invalidates the patent. On
October28, 2004, the Company filed an opposition to ReDs motion to stay the case for 90 days and an opposition to ReDs motion for a more definite statement with respect to willful infringement. Based on ReD UKs representation
that ReD US is the sole entity that develops, operates, and distributes the eBitGuard service, the Company agreed to dismiss ReD UK while reserving the right to reinstitute action against ReD UK in the event the Company later discovers that ReD UK
is subject to the courts personal jurisdiction. In return, ReD UK agreed that if the Company later establishes that personal jurisdiction existed, the Company could re-file against ReD UK in this action without prejudice to its damages claim.
The Company also filed an amended complaint, removing ReD UK as a named defendant and restating the willful infringement claim. On November16, 2004, the court granted ReDs motion to stay the proceedings pending the PTOs decision as
to whether it will grant ReDs request for re-examination. On December30, 2004, the PTO granted ReDs request for a re-examination. On January19, 2005, ReD filed a motion to dismiss the case without prejudice or to extend the
stay until completion of the re-examination process. On January24, 2005, the court extended the stay pending the re-examination process, vacated ReDs motion to dismiss, and ordered quarterly updates as to the status of the re-examination
process. On April25, 2005, the parties filed a joint status report that was approved by the court. On June20, 2005, the PTO issued a preliminary office action rejecting all of the claims of the 154 patent based on one of the prior
art references cited by ReD. On July14, 2005, the Company met with the PTO examiner handling the re-examination to distinguish the prior art from the claims of the 154 patent. On August9, 2006, the PTO issued a final office action
rejecting all of the claims of the 154 patent. On September7, 2006, the Company filed a response to the office action requesting certain amendments to the claims. On October10, 2006, the PTO filed a response rejecting the
amendments and extending the Companys deadline to file a notice of appeal. On October30, 2006, the Company filed a notice of appeal. While there can be no assurances as to the outcome of the lawsuit, the Company does not presently
believe that the lawsuit would have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

The Company is currently party to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary
course of business. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that the outcome of any of these claims or any of the above mentioned legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its

benefit included a $99 million reduction in the Companys valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. During 2005, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $31 million. This benefit included a $32 million
reduction in the Companys valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. These determinations were based on projected taxable income. As of December31, 2006, the Company has approximately $1576 million federal and $461 million state net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future taxable income. Of these amounts, $54 million and $09 million represent federal
and state tax deductions, respectively, from stock option compensation. The tax benefit from these deductions will be recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital in the year in which the benefit is realized. As of December31, 2006, the Company also has research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $11 million and $07 million for
federal and state income tax purposes, respectively.

financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the tax
attributes in tax returns, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. $63 million of the valuation allowance is attributable to the tax benefits of stock option compensation, the benefit of which will be
credited to additional paid-in capital in the year in which the benefit is realized. The valuation allowance decreased approximately $148 million from December31, 2005 to December31, 2006. 14. Employee Savings and Retirement Plan The Company

Options to purchase 361,000, 1,230,000, and 708,000 shares of common stock were outstanding during
2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect was antidilutive. 16.
Guarantees The Company from time to time enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require the Company to indemnify
parties against third-party claims. These contracts primarily relate to: icertain real estate leases, under which the Company may be required to indemnify property owners for environmental and other liabilities, and other claims arising from
the Companys use of the applicable premises; and iicertain agreements with the Companys officers, directors and employees, under which the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their
employment relationship. The terms of such obligations vary. Generally, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated. Because the
obligated amounts of these types of agreements often are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, the Company has not been obligated to make significant payments for these
obligations, and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on its balance sheet as of December31, 2006 or 2005. 17. Quarterly

Item2:CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.Based on this evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in this report.It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and
there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15f and 15d -15f for the Company. Management designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over
financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. The internal controls procedures were designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that the Companys transactions are properly authorized, its assets are safeguarded against unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition and its transactions are properly recorded and reported, all to permit the preparation of the Companys financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Companys management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting. In making this assessment, the Company management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. In the course of this evaluation, the Company sought to identify data errors, controls problems or acts of fraud. Our
internal controls over financial reporting are evaluated on an ongoing basis by our finance department. The overall goal of these various evaluation activities is to monitor our internal controls over financial reporting and to make modifications as
necessary; our intent in this regard is that the internal controls over financial reporting will be maintained as dynamic systems that change including improvements and corrections as conditions warrant. Based on this evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that its internal controls over financial
reporting are effective.It should be noted that internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial
reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm,
Ernst Young LLP, audited managements assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006. Ernst Young LLP has issued an attestation report which is
included in this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no significant changes in the Companys internal controls or in other factors which could significantly affect internal controls
subsequent to the date the Company carried out this evaluation.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders of CyberSource Corporation We
have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Management Assessment of Internal Control, that CyberSource Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on
criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. CyberSource Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of
the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that CyberSource Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based
on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, CyberSource Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets
of CyberSource Corporation as of December31, 2006 and 2005 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2006 of CyberSource
Corporation and our report dated March12, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  s/ERNST YOUNG LLP
