28 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM     Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. a
Delaware corporation and subsidiaries together the Company as of December31, 2005 and 2004,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive
income, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December31, 2005. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as
of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two
years in the period ended December31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on
the basic financial statements
taken as a whole. The schedule II is presented for
purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial
statements and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the effectiveness of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. and subsidiariess
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSOand our report dated March20, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
on managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. S/ GRANT THORNTON LLP Denver, Colorado
March20, 2006 29 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM     Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A, that Advanced Energy Industries,
Inc. a Delaware Corporation and subsidiaries together the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. Advanced Energy Industries, Inc.s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
Also in our opinion, Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on

Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. and

The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these consolidated statements. 36 Table of Contents ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1COMPANY OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Advanced Energy Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is primarily engaged in the
development and production of components and subsystems critical to plasma-based manufacturing
processes, which are used by manufacturers of semiconductors and in industrial thin-film
manufacturing processes. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Advanced
Energy Industries, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries collectively, the Company. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The
consolidated financial statements are stated in United States dollars and are prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. SEGMENT REPORTING The Company operates in one segment for the manufacture, marketing and
servicing of key subsystems, primarily to the semiconductor capital equipment industry. In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No131, Disclosures About
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Companys chief operating decision maker
has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer, who reviews operating results to make decisions
about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. SFAS No131, which is
based on a management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements to report selected
segment information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and
services, major customers, and the countries in which the entity holds material assets and reports
revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under SFAS No131 due to their
similar customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products and
services; and procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes. To report revenues from
external customers for each product and service or group of similar products and services would not
be practicable. Since the Company operates in one segment, all financial information required by
SFAS No131 can be found in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the
Companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Significant estimates are used when establishing allowances for doubtful accounts, determining
useful lives for depreciation and amortization, assessing the need for impairment charges,
establishing warranty reserves, allocating purchase price among the fair values of assets acquired
and liabilities assumed, accounting for income taxes, and assessing excess and obsolete inventory
and various others items. The Company evaluates these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis
and bases its estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as
identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB reissued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation as SFAS No123R, Share Based Compensation. This statement replaces
SFAS No123, amends SFAS No95, Statement of Cash Flows, and supersedes Accounting Principles
Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No123R requires
companies to apply a fair-value based measurement method in accounting for share-based payment
transactions with employees and to record compensation expense for all share-based awards granted,
and to awards modified, repurchased or cancelled after the required effective date. Compensation
expense for outstanding awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the
effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost
calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under SFAS No123, adjusted for expected forfeitures.
Additionally, SFAS No123R will require entities to record compensation expense for employee
stock purchase plans that may not have previously been considered compensatory under the existing
rules. It will also require the benefits associated with tax deductions in excess of recognized
compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as
currently required. The Company will adopt SFAS No123R as of January1, 2006. Upon adoption,
the Company will use the modified prospective method and therefore will not restate prior period
results. This statement will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations as the
Company will be required to record compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations
rather than disclose the impact within its notes to the consolidated financial statements, but will
not have a significant impact on the Companys overall cash flow or financial position. Before
adjustment for expected forfeitures, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to
unvested options outstanding as of December31, 2005 was approximately $35million and will be
recorded over the remaining vesting period. The Company will continue to use the Black-Scholes
option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based awards upon adoption in 2006. In November2004, the FASB issued SFAS No151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting
Research Bulletin No43, Chapter4, Inventory Pricing. SFAS No151 clarifies that abnormal
amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials spoilageshould
be recognized as current-period charges. In addition, it requires that allocation of fixed
production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. SFAS No151 will be effective for 37 Table of Contents inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005 and will be applied on a
prospective basis by the Company for the fiscal year beginning January1, 2006. The adoption of
SFAS No151 is not expected to have a material affect on the Companys financial position and
results of operations. On June9, 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.
SFAS No154 replaces APB Opinion No20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS No3, Reporting
Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements, and changes the requirements for the
accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS No154 applies to all
voluntary changes in accounting principle. It also applies to changes required by an accounting
pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition
provisions. SFAS No154 must be adopted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in
fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes
and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date SFAS No154 is issued. The
adoption of SFAS No154 is not expected to have a material affect on the Companys financial
position and results of operations. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Companys standard shipping term is freight on board FOB
shipping point, for which revenue is recognized upon shipment of its products, at which time title
passes to the customer, the price is fixed and collectability is reasonably assured. For certain
customers, the Company has FOB destination terms, for which revenue is recognized upon receipt of
the products by the customer, at which time title passes to the customer, the price is fixed and
collectability is reasonably assured. Revenues from contracts that contain customer acceptance
provisions are deferred until customer acceptance occurs. Generally, the Company does not have
obligations to its customers after its products are shipped under FOB shipping point terms, after
its products are received by customers under FOB destination terms, and after the products are
accepted by customers under contractual acceptance provisions, other than pursuant to warranty
obligations. In limited instances, the Company provides installation of its products. In accordance
with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue 00-21 Accounting for Revenue Arrangements With
Multiple Deliverables, the Company allocates revenue based on the fair value of the delivered
item, generally the product, and the undelivered item, installation, based on their respective fair
values. Revenue related to the undelivered item is deferred until the services have been completed.
In certain limited instances, some of the Companys customers have negotiated product acceptance
provisions relative to specific orders. Under these circumstances, the Company defers revenue
recognition until the related acceptance provisions have been satisfied. Revenue deferrals are
reported as customer deposits and deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. In certain instances, the Company requires its customers to pay for a portion or all of their
purchases prior to the Company building or shipping these products. Cash payments received prior to
shipment are recorded as customer deposits and deferred revenue in the condensed consolidated
balance sheets, and then recognized as revenue as appropriate based upon the shipping terms of the
products. The Company does not offer price protections to its customers or allow returns, unless
covered by its normal policy for repair of defective products. SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are
recorded in sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Shipping and handling costs
incurred by the Company for the delivery of products to customers are included in cost of sales in
the consolidated statements of operations. EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY Inventory is written down or written off when it becomes
obsolete, generally due to engineering changes to a product or discontinuance of a product line, or
when it is deemed excess. Judgment by management is necessary in estimating the net realizable
value of inventory based primarily upon forecasts of product demand. Charges for excess and
obsolete inventory are recorded, as necessary, within cost of sales in the consolidated statements
of operations. The Company recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventory of $17million in
2005, $113million in 2004 and $30million in 2003. WARRANTY POLICY The Company offers warranty coverage for its products for periods typically
ranging from 12 to 24months after shipment. The Company estimates the anticipated costs of
repairing products under warranty based on the historical cost of the repairs and expected failure
rates. The assumptions used to estimate warranty accruals are reevaluated periodically in light of
actual experience and, when appropriate, the accruals are adjusted. The Companys determination of
the appropriate level of warranty accrual is subjective and based on estimates. Estimated warranty
costs are recorded at the time of sale of the related product, and are recorded within cost of
sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded warranty charges of $112million in 2005, $105million in 2004 and $81
million in 2003. Included within the warranty charges is amortization of customer service equipment, which is
manufactured product that is utilized as replacement and loaner equipment to existing customers, of
$21million in 2005, $20million in 2004 and $22million in 2003. The following summarizes the activity in the Companys warranty reserves during 2005 and 2004

38 Table of Contents SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE Selling, general and administrative expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations are expensed as incurred, including legal and
advertising costs. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION At December31, 2005, the Company had three active stock-based
compensation plans, which are more fully described in Note 18. The Company accounts for employee
stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations. APB Opinion No25 requires
the use of the intrinsic value method, which measures compensation cost as the excess, if any, of
the quoted market price of the stock at the measurement date over the amount an employee must pay
to acquire the stock. With the exception of certain options granted in 1999 and 2000 by a
shareholder of Sekidenko, Inc., prior to its acquisition by the Company which was accounted for as
a pooling of interests, all options granted under these plans have an exercise price equal to the
market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, therefore no compensation cost
related to such options is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. In 2005, the
Company began issuing restricted stock units, compensation cost for which is recorded in the
consolidated statement of operations. Had compensation cost for the Companys plans been
determined consistent with the fair value-based method prescribed by SFAS No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, the Companys net income would have changed to the following adjusted

tax effects due to the Company recording valuation allowances against
certain deferred tax assets in 2003 see Note 12.   
b
Compensation cost recognized with respect to options that are
forfeited prior to vesting is reflected as a reduction of compensation
expense in the period of forfeiture. Compensation expense related to
awards granted under the Companys employee stock purchase plan
ESPP is estimated until the period in which settlement occurs, as
the number of shares of common stock awarded and the purchase price
are not known until settlement.   
c
Compensation expense in 2005 represents the expense associated with
the Companys grants to employees of restricted stock units.
Compensation expense in 2004 and 2003, represents expense associated
with employee option grants made by a shareholder of Sekidenko, Inc.
prior to its acquisition by the Company to employees under a
preexisting arrangement to purchase shares of his common stock already
outstanding at exercise prices below fair value. The options fully
vested during the first quarter of 2004.   
d
Adjustment includes expense of approximately $69million, resulting
from the acceleration of vesting of options outstanding as of October
18, 2005 that have an exercise price of $1500 per share or higher.
Options to purchase approximately 624,000 shares of common stock that
would otherwise have vested over the subsequent 30months became fully
vested. For SFAS No123 purposes, the fair value of each option grant and purchase right granted
under the ESPP are estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following weighted-average assumptions

39 Table of Contents Based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the weighted-average estimated fair value of
employee stock option grants was $476 in 2005, $849 in 2004 and $788 in 2003. The
weighted-average estimated fair value of purchase rights granted under the ESPP was $308 in 2005 345 in 2004 and $499 in 2003. The total fair value of options granted was computed to be approximately $21million in 2005 109million in 2004 and $143million in 2003. These amounts are amortized ratably over the
vesting period of the options for the purpose of calculating the pro forma disclosure above. The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS No123R as of January1, 2006, as further
discussed under the heading New Accounting Pronouncements above. The adoption of this statement
will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations as the Company will be required
to record compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations rather than disclose the
impact within its notes to the consolidated financial statements. On October18, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the acceleration of the
vesting of certain stock options. Vesting was accelerated for those options outstanding as of
October18, 2005 that have exercise prices of $1500 per share or higher. The closing price of the
Companys common stock on October18, 2005 was $1069 per share. As a result, options to purchase
approximately 624,000 shares of common stock that would otherwise have vested over the subsequent
30months became fully vested. As of October18, 2005, options to purchase 38million shares of
the Companys common stock were outstanding. Unvested options totaling 852,000 that have an
exercise price less than $1500 per share that were outstanding as of October18, 2005 will
continue to vest on their normal schedule. The Board of Directors determined to accelerate the
vesting of these options principally to reduce future compensation expense that would otherwise be
required to be recorded in the statement of operations in periods following the Companys adoption
of SFAS No123R. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is involved in disputes and legal actions arising
in the normal course of our business. While we currently believe that the amount of any ultimate
loss would not be material to our financial position, the outcome of these actions is
inherently difficult to predict. In the event of an adverse outcome, the ultimate loss
could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or reported results of operations in
a particular quarter. An unfavorable decision, particularly in patent litigation, could require
material changes in production processes and products or result in our inability to ship products
or components found to have violated third-party patent rights. The Company accrues loss
contingencies in connection with its commitments and contingencies, including litigation, when it
is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS The Company considers all amounts on deposit with financial
institutions and highly liquid investments valued at cost, which approximates fair value with an
original maturity of 90days or less to be cash and cash equivalents. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company
to credit risk, include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and trade accounts
receivable. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and certain
other financial instruments with various major financial institutions. The Company performs
periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and limits the
amount of credit exposure with any one institution. The Companys customers generally are
concentrated in the semiconductor capital equipment industry. As a result the Company is generally
exposed to credit risk associated with this industry. Sales by the Companys foreign subsidiaries
are primarily denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar. The Company
establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of
specific customers, historical trends and other information. MARKETABLE SECURITIES The Companys investment in marketable securities, includes commercial
paper, municipal bonds and notes and institutional money markets. These investments are classified
as available for sale securities, and are recorded at fair value with changes in fair market value
recorded as unrealized holding gains or losses in other comprehensive loss, net of tax. Due to the
short-term, highly liquid nature of the marketable securities held by the Company, the cost,
including accrued interest on such investments, approximates fair value. The Company also has investments in marketable equity securities which have been included in
deposits and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, due to the Companys expressed
intent and demonstrated ability to hold for greater than one year. These investments are classified
as available-for-sale securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and
losses included in other comprehensive loss, net of tax. INVENTORIES Inventories include costs of materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead.
Inventories are valued at the lower of market or cost, computed on a first-in, first-out basis and
are presented net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment is stated at cost or estimated fair value upon
acquisition. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over thirty-five to forty
years for buildings; three to ten years for machinery, equipment, furniture and fixtures and
vehicles; and three years for computer and communication equipment. Amortization of leasehold
improvements and leased equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the lease term
or the estimated useful life of the assets, whichever period is shorter. Additions, improvements,
and major renewals are capitalized, while maintenance, repairs, and 40 Table of Contents minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When depreciable assets are retired, or otherwise disposed
of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any related
gains or losses are included in the consolidated statement of operations. Property and other
long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their
carrying amount may not be recoverable. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the
fair market value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. Instead,
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to periodic at least annual
tests for impairment. For the periods presented, the Company does not have any indefinite-lived
intangible assets, other than goodwill. Impairment testing is performed in two steps: ithe
Company assesses goodwill for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of its reporting
unit with its carrying value, and iiif potential impairment is indicated because the reporting
units fair value is less than its carrying amount, the Company measures the amount of impairment
loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Finite-lived intangible assets continue to be amortized using the straight-line method over
their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances
indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. CUSTOMER SERVICE EQUIPMENT Customer service equipment is manufactured product that is
utilized as replacement and loaner equipment to existing customers, which is amortized to cost of
sales over its estimated useful life of two years. Demonstration equipment was manufactured product that is utilized for sales demonstration and
evaluation purposes. Historically, the Company had amortized demonstration equipment over its
estimated useful life of two years. During the fourth quarter of 2004, as a result of the
continuing process of obtaining and analyzing historical data and the Companys plan for use of the
current and future demonstration equipment, the Company made a change in the estimated useful life
of the demonstration equipment from two years to zero years. As a result of this change in
estimate, the net book value of demonstration equipment of approximately $37million was written
off. The Companys current policy is to record selling, general and administrative expense for the
demonstration equipment as it is given to our customer or potential customer. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The functional currency of the Companys foreign subsidiaries
is their local currency, with the exception of the Companys manufacturing facility in Shenzhen,
China where the United States dollar is the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of
international subsidiaries are translated to United States dollars at period-end exchange rates,
and statement of operations activity and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates during
the period. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders
equity. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency are recorded based on
exchange rates at the time such transactions arise. Subsequent changes in exchange rates result in
foreign currency transaction gains and losses which are reflected in income as unrealized based on
period end translation or realized upon settlement of the transactions. Unrealized transaction
gains and losses applicable to permanent investments by the Company in its foreign subsidiaries are
included as cumulative translation adjustments, and unrealized translation gains or losses
applicable to non-permanent intercompany receivables from or payables to the Company and its
foreign subsidiaries are included in income. RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current period presentation. 2DISPOSITIONS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On June24, 2005, the Company sold the assets of its EMCO product line to an
unrelated third party for net cash proceeds of $37million, as this product line was not critical
to the Companys core operations. The sale included assets with a book value of approximately
$663,000, comprised of $515,000 of accounts receivable, $71,000 of inventory, $42,000 of fixed
assets, and $35,000 of prepaid expenses, and liabilities of approximately $94,000. In accordance
with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill of $471,000 was allocated to
the sale based upon its estimated fair value relative to the portion of the reporting unit that
will be retained. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of $26million, which is recorded in
discontinued operations in the statement of operations. In the fourth quarter of 2005, a purchase
price adjustment of $237,000 was made in favor of the Company, and recorded as additional gain on
the sale. The EMCO product line did not represent a significant portion of the Companys
operations, with revenues representing 27% of annual consolidated sales in 2003, 16% in 2004 and
18% through its sale on June24, 2005. Due to the insignificant impact of the EMCO product line on
the Companys results of operations, such results are included in income from operations in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations. On November23, 2005, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the assets of its IKOR
product line to an unrelated third party, as this product line was not considered to be critical to
the Companys core operations. Net cash proceeds of $89million were received, with an additional
$10million held in escrow to satisfy any potential indemnity claims. The sale included assets
with a book value of approximately $41million, comprised of $13million of accounts receivable 13million of inventory, $492,000 of fixed assets, and $44,000 of prepaid expenses, and
liabilities of approximately $207,000. Goodwill of $10million was allocated to the sale based
upon its estimated fair value relative to the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained.
The Company recognized a gain on 41 Table of Contents the sale of $50million, which is recorded in discontinued operations in the consolidated
statement of operations. The results of operations directly attributed to the IKOR product line

3RESTRUCTURING COSTS Restructuring charges include the costs associated with actions taken by the Company primarily
in response to downturns in the semiconductor capital equipment industry. These charges consist of
costs that are incurred to exit an activity or cancel an existing contractual obligation, including
the closure of facilities and employee termination related charges. Effective January1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No146, Accounting for Exit or Disposal
Activities, which nullifies EITF Issue No94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity. SFAS No146 requires costs associated
with exit or disposal activities to be recognized when they are incurred, whereas under EITF Issue
No94-3, a liability was recognized at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan. As
related to employee termination benefits, the provisions of SFAS No146 offer guidance on
one-time termination benefits, and exclude from the scope on-going benefit arrangements,
therefore, the Company follows the guidance within SFAS No146 for voluntary severances and other
one-time termination benefits. The accounting for the standard severance benefits that the Company pays for involuntarily
severed employees, considered an on-going benefit arrangement, is excluded from the scope of SFAS
No146. For these benefits, the Company follows the guidance under SFAS No88, Employers
Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination
Benefits. Severance costs accounted for under SFAS No88 are accrued and recorded as
restructuring expense when such amount is probable that employees will be entitled to benefits and
the amount can be reasonably estimated. The following table summarizes the components of the restructuring charges, the payments and
non-cash charges, and the remaining accrual as of December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003

At the end of 2002, the Company announced major changes in its operations to occur
through the end of 2003. These included establishing a new manufacturing facility in China,
consolidating worldwide sales forces, a move to lower-cost Asian suppliers and the intention to
close or sell certain facilities. 42 Table of Contents Associated with the above plan, the Company recognized charges during 2003 as follows   
In the first quarter of 2003, the Company recorded charges
totaling approximately $15million primarily associated with
manufacturing and administrative personnel headcount
reductions in the Companys Japanese operations. In
accordance with Japanese labor regulations the Company
offered voluntary termination benefits to all of its Japanese
employees. The voluntary termination benefits were accepted
by 36 employees, with termination dates in the second quarter
of 2003.   
In the second quarter of 2003, the Company recognized charges
totaling $768,000 that consisted primarily of the involuntary
termination of 55 manufacturing and administrative personnel
in the Companys United States operations.   
In the third quarter of 2003, the Company recognized charges
of approximately $10million that consisted of $704,000 of
expense for involuntary employee termination benefits for 20
employees and $307,000 related to asset impairments incurred
as a result of exiting its Longmont, Colorado manufacturing
facilities.   
In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recognized
approximately $10million that consisted primarily of the
recognition of expense for involuntary employee termination
benefits associated with the involuntary employee termination
benefits of 34 manufacturing and administrative personnel in
the Companys United States operations. In the first, second and third quarters of 2004, the Company recorded restructuring
charges of $220,000, $187,000 and $88,000, respectively, which primarily consisted of the
recognition of expense for involuntary employee termination benefits associated with headcount
reductions of approximately 34, 12 and 4 employees, respectively, in the Companys United States
operations. All affected employees were terminated prior to the respective quarter ends.
Additionally, in the third quarter, the Company reversed $253,000 of previously recorded charges
due to variances from the original estimates used to establish the Companys reserve due to some
voluntary employee terminations prior to their agreed upon termination date no longer meeting the
requirements to receive a severance payment and negotiated lease termination payments below
original estimates. As a result of such reversal, the Companys restructuring accrual balance for
employee severance and termination costs was $0 at September30, 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $37million. The
$37million charge primarily consisted of employee termination and related costs associated with
the involuntary severance of 212 employees, including 60 agency employees, at the Companys Fort
Collins facility. All of such charges relate to separation costs anticipated to be paid to the
terminated employees, in cash, by the end of the second quarter of 2005. The need to reduce
headcount in Fort Collins resulted primarily from the transfer of a substantial portion of the
Companys manufacturing operations to Shenzhen, China. Related to this operational restructuring, and the transition of certain product lines from
certain of the Companys locations in Europe and Japan, the Company recorded restructuring charges
for employee severance and termination costs of $13million in the first quarter of 2005, $475,000
in the second quarter, $202,000 in the third quarter and $135,000 in the fourth quarter. These
charges are associated with 216 employees in the United States, 11 employees in Europe and three
employees in Japan. With the exception of one employee in the United States, all of these employee
severance and termination costs have been paid as of December31, 2005. Through the transition of
the Companys manufacturing operations from the Fort Collins facility to Shenzhen, China, the
Company recognized the need to retain 11 employees considered in the original reserve, and
therefore in the third quarter of 2005 restructuring reserves of $180,000 have been reversed. The
Company expects to pay the remaining accrual for employee severance and termination costs of
approximately $130,000 by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Impairments of facility-related assets were recorded in the second quarter of 2005 for
$589,000 in the United States and in the third quarter of 2005 for $157,000 in Japan, as a result
of consolidation of certain of the Companys facilities. The remaining facility closure cost liability is expected to be paid over the remaining lease
term expiring at the end of 2006 and is reflected net of expected sublease income of $51,000. 4MARKETABLE SECURITIES Marketable securities consisted of the following

The Companys goodwill and other intangible assets have primarily resulted from purchases of
Japanese and German companies, and accordingly, carrying amounts for these assets are impacted by
changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Aggregate amortization expense related to amortizable intangibles was $21million in 2005 39million in 2004 and $46million in 2003. Estimated amortization expense related to the
Companys acquired intangibles fluctuates with changes in foreign currency exchange rates between
the United States dollar and the Japanese yen and the euro. Estimated amortization expense related
to amortizable intangibles for each of the five years 2006 through 2010 is as follows in

In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test, and
concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed at the measurement date, as the estimated fair
value of the Companys reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount. During the fourth quarter of 2004, in conjunction with our financial forecasting for future
periods, it was evident that projected cash flows from certain customers of the Dressler product
line were substantially below amounts previously projected. The projected cash flows were
considered in determining the fair value of certain contract-based and other amortizable intangible
assets recorded at acquisition and also in subsequent periods to assess such assets for potential
impairment. Due to the decline in projected cash flows, the Company performed assessments of the
carrying values of the related amortizable intangible assets. These assessments consisted of
estimating the intangible assets fair value and comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying
value of the asset. The Company estimated the intangible assets fair value through the use of
projected cash flows based upon projected revenue streams over the life of the asset, discounted at
rates consistent with the risk of the related cash flows. Based on this analysis the Company
determined that the fair values of certain intangible assets were below the respective carrying
values, and recorded impairment charges of approximately $29million, which has been reported as
an impairment of intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Also during the fourth quarter of 2004, in conjunction with the Companys restructuring plan,
employees who were the subject of certain contract-based amortizable intangibles left the Company
or their responsibilities were significantly altered. As a result, the Company performed
assessments of the carrying values of the related amortizable intangible assets. These assessments
consisted of estimating the intangible assets fair value and comparing the estimated fair value to
the carrying value of the asset. The Company estimated the intangible assets fair value through
the use of a lost profits method of determining the fair value, arriving at projected cash flows
which were then discounted at rates consistent with the risk of the related cash flows. Based on
this analysis the Company determined that the fair values of certain intangible assets were below
the respective carrying values, and recorded impairment charges of approximately $397,000, which
has been reported as an impairment of intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated statement
of operations. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company determined that one of its mass flow controller
products would not conform to changing customer technology requirements, and as such would no
longer be accepted by the Companys customers. As a result, the Company performed an assessment of
the carrying value of the related intangible asset. This assessment consisted of estimating the 45 Table of Contents intangible assets fair value and comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the
asset. The Company estimated the intangible assets fair value by applying a hypothetical royalty
rate to the projected revenue stream and using a cash flow model discounted at rates consistent
with the risk of the related cash flows. Based on this analysis the Company determined that the
fair value of the intangible asset was minimal and recorded an impairment charge of approximately
$12million, which has also been reported as an impairment of intangible assets in the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations. 9SENIOR BORROWINGS Senior borrowings consisted of the following

Borrowings under the revolving line of credit agreement are limited based upon letters of
credit outstanding under this agreement and the lenders borrowing base calculation, which considers
among other factors, our accounts receivable and inventory balances. The Company is subject to
covenants on its line of credit that provide certain restrictions related to working capital,
leverage, net worth, acquisitions, and payment and declaration of dividends. The Company was in
compliance with these covenants at December31, 2005. The senior borrowings assumed in the acquisition of Aera Japan Limited are collateralized by
the Companys building in Japan and the mortgage note payable is collateralized by the Companys
building in Korea. Additionally, approximately $600,000 is restricted in Korea associated with the
mortgage note payable, which restrictions will be released upon payment of the mortgage note. Scheduled maturities of the Companys outstanding borrowings are as follows at December31,

On August17, 2005, the Company issued 10million shares of common stock at a price
of $975 per share pursuant to an underwritten public offering. On August22, 2005, the Company
issued an additional 15million shares of common stock at the same price, pursuant to the
underwriters exercise of their over-allotment option. Proceeds from this offering of 115million
shares of common stock were approximately $1055million, net of the underwriters discount and
offering expenses of approximately $66million. The net proceeds were used to fully redeem the
Companys 525% convertible subordinated notes due 2006, and toward the full redemption of the
Companys 50% convertible subordinated notes due 2006. Debt extinguishment expense recorded in
the consolidated statements of operations of $32million is comprised of $21million for
redemption premium and $11million for the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs. 11EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing income available to common
stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The
computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the numerator is
increased to exclude certain charges which would not have been incurred, and the denominator is
increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding using
the if-converted and treasury stock methods, if securities containing potentially dilutive common
shares convertible notes payable, stock options and restricted 46 Table of Contents stock units had been converted to such common shares, and if such assumed conversion is dilutive.
As of December31, 2005, stock options and restricted stock units totaling approximately
36million were outstanding, of which 33million shares are not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect of including such
options in the computation would be anti-dilutive. Due to the
Companys net loss for the years ended
December31, 2004 and 2003, basic and diluted EPS are the same, as the assumed conversion of all potentially
dilutive securities would be anti-dilutive. For the years ended
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the
affect of potential conversion of the Companys convertible subordinated notes payable was not
included in this computation because to do so would be anti-dilutive. The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used in the calculation
of basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December31, 2005,

12INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. SFAS No109 requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recognized for temporary
differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities, computed
at the expected tax rates for the periods in which the assets or liabilities will be realized, as
well as for the expected tax benefit of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Since
2003, the Company has recorded valuation allowances against certain of its United States and
foreign net deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where the Company has incurred significant losses.
Given such experience, management could not conclude that it was more likely than not that these
net deferred tax assets will be realized. While there may be indications that the Companys
operating results may improve in future periods, the Companys management, in accordance with SFAS
No109, in evaluating the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets, is required to place
greater weight on the Companys historical results as compared to projections regarding future
taxable income. If the Company generates future taxable income, or should the Company be able to
conclude that sufficient taxable income is reasonably assured based on profitable operations, in
the appropriate tax jurisdictions, against which these tax attributes may be applied, some portion
or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed and a corresponding reduction in income tax
expense will be reported in such period. Approximately $26million of the valuation allowance
relates to the benefit from stock-based compensation. Any reversal of valuation allowance from this
item will be reflected as a component of stockholders equity. The Company assesses the recoverability of its net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.
If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that it will realize a portion or all of
its net deferred tax assets, some portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed with a
corresponding reduction in income tax expense in such period. From 2003 through 2005, the Company
has only reversed portions of such valuation allowances for which it has realized the underlying
asset. When recording acquisitions, the Company has recorded valuation allowances due to the
uncertainty related to the realization of certain deferred tax assets existing at the acquisition
dates. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future
periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed. Approximately $37million of the
valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets obtained through acquisitions. Any reversals of
valuation allowances recorded in purchase accounting will be reflected as a reduction of goodwill
in the period of reversal. For the year ended December31, 2005, no valuation allowances
established in purchase accounting were reversed with a corresponding reduction in goodwill. The income tax provision of $49million in 2005 represents an effective tax rate on income
from continuing operations of 57% and the income tax provision of $39million in 2004 represents
an effective tax rate on income from continuing operations of negative 37%, due to taxable income
earned in certain foreign jurisdictions. The income tax provision of $118million in 2003
represents an effective tax rate on income from continuing operations of negative 35%, due to
taxable income earned in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Companys income from discontinued
operations was earned in the United States. No provision for income taxes is attributed to these
discontinued operations, due to the valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the
United States, including those generated by net operating losses. 47 Table of Contents The provision benefitfor income taxes for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003

13RETIREMENT PLANS The Company has a 401k profit sharing plan which covers most full-time employees age
eighteen or older. Participants may defer up to the maximum amount allowed as determined by law.
Participants are immediately vested in their contributions. The Company may make discretionary contributions based on corporate financial results. For the
years ended December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, the Companys contribution for participants in its
401k plan was 25% matching on contributions by employees up to 6% of the employees compensation.
The Companys total contributions to the plan were approximately $633,000 in 2005, $698,000 in
2004 and $635,000 in 2003. Vesting in the profit sharing contribution account is based on years of
service, with most participants fully vested after four years of credited service. 14COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company has committed to purchase approximately $25million of parts, components and
subassemblies in 2006. This inventory purchase obligation represents a minimum purchase
commitment to ensure the Company has an adequate supply of critical components to meet the demand
of its customers. The Company believes these inventory purchases will be consumed in its on-going
operations during 2006. DISPUTES AND LEGAL ACTIONS The Company is involved in disputes and legal actions arising in the normal course of its
business. The Companys most significant legal actions have involved the application of patent law
to complex technologies and intellectual property. The determination of whether such technologies
infringe upon the Companys or others patents can be highly subjective. This subjectivity
introduces substantial additional risk with regard to the outcome of the Companys disputes and
legal actions related to intellectual property. In the event of any adverse outcome, the ultimate
loss could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or reported
results of operations in a particular period. An unfavorable decision, particularly in patent
litigation, could require material changes in production processes and products or result in the
Companys inability to ship products or components found to have violated third-party patent
rights. The Company accrues loss contingencies in connection with its litigation when it is
probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In April2003, the Company filed a claim in the United States District Court for the District
of Colorado seeking a declaratory ruling that its plasma source products Xstream With Active
Matching Network Xstream products were not in violation of patents held in the United States
by MKS Instruments, Inc. MKS. This case was transferred by the Colorado court to the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware for consolidation with a patent infringement
suit filed in that court by MKS in 49 Table of Contents May2003, alleging that the Companys Xstream products infringe five patents held by MKS. On July
23, 2004, a jury returned a verdict of infringement of three MKS patents, which did not stipulate
damages. On October3, 2005, the Company executed a settlement agreement with MKS resolving all
pending claims involving the Xstream products and all other toroidal plasma generator products.
Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the Company paid $30million in cash to MKS. The Company
also stipulated to a final judgment of infringement and an injunction prohibiting the Company from
making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing into the United States, or any country in
which a counterpart patent exists, its Xstream products and all other toroidal plasma generator
products, except as permitted under the settlement agreement. Sales of these products have
accounted for less than 5% of the Companys total sales each year since introduction of the
products. On June2, 2004, MKS filed a petition in the District Court in Munich, Germany, alleging
infringement by the Companys Xstream products of a counterpart German patent owned by MKS. On
August4, 2004, this court dismissed MKSs petition and assessed costs of the proceeding against
MKS. MKS refiled an infringement petition in the District Court of Mannheim. On April8, 2005, the
Mannheim court issued a judgment against the Company for infringement of MKSs patent, which did
not specify damages. The action was dismissed pursuant to the settlement agreement referenced above
in connection with the Xstream products litigation in the United States. A petition for invalidity
of MKSs patent brought by the Company was also dismissed. On July12, 2004, the Company filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware against MKS alleging that MKSs Astron reactive gas source products infringe
Advanced Energys United States Patent No6,046,546. The case was voluntarily dismissed on March
11, 2005 under an agreement that left the Company free to refile its claims upon conclusion of
MKSs lawsuit against the Companys Xstream products. Pursuant to the settlement agreement
referenced above in connection with the Xstream products litigation, the Company agreed to not
refile its claims related to MKSs Astron reactive gas source products. On June8, 2005, the Korean Customs Service KCS issued a Pre-Taxation Notification
concerning back duties and value added taxes allegedly owed on goods imported by the Companys
Korean subsidiary, Advanced Energy Industries Korea, Inc., during the five year period ended June
8, 2005. On June27, 2005, the Company protested the notifications on the grounds that the
assessment was unwarranted and based on a misapplication of international tariff rules. On
September9, 2005, the KCS rejected the protest brought by the Company. Beginning on September19,
2005, the KCS issued a series of taxation notices for duties and penalties owed of approximately
$22million. In order to appeal the assessment to the Korean National Tax Tribunal, an independent
review board of the Korean Ministry of Finance and Economy, the Company paid the taxation notices.
The Company filed its appeals of the assessments in December2005, and the KCS has filed a response
in opposition to its appeal. The Company anticipates that the Korean National Tax Tribunal will
schedule a hearing for adjudication of the matter in the second quarter of 2006. Although the
Company has paid the taxation notices in order to appeal the assessment, the Company does not
believe such amounts represent a probable expense and therefore has not accrued such in the
consolidated statement of operations. The Company believes that the amount of any ultimate loss
will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or consolidated results
of operations. OPERATING CAPITAL LEASES The Company has various operating leases for automobiles, equipment, and office and production
facilities see Note 16. Lease expense under operating leases was approximately $59million in
2005, $62million in 2004 and $62million in 2003. The future minimum rental payments required under non-cancelable operating leases as of
December31, 2005 are as follows

Sales to Ulvac, Inc. represented less than 10% during this period. There were no other customers that represented greater than 10% of the Companys total sales
for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Trade accounts receivable from Applied Materials, Inc. were approximately $102million as of
December31, 2005, which represented approximately 16% of the Companys total trade accounts
receivable. At December31, 2005, trade accounts receivable from ULVAC, Inc. were approximately
$145million, representing approximately 22% of the Companys total trade accounts receivable. No
other customers had a trade accounts receivable balance in excess of 10% of the total trade
accounts receivable at December31, 2005. 16RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company leases its executive offices and manufacturing facilities in Fort Collins,
Colorado from two limited liability partnerships, in which the Companys Chairman of the Board of
Directors holds an interest. The leases relating to these spaces expire in 2009, 2011 and 2016, and
contain monthly payments of approximately $89,000, $71,000 and $84,000, respectively. For the year ended December31, 2005, approximately $29million was paid attributable to
these leases, and approximately $28million in each of the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003.
Rent and related amounts are expensed as incurred. The Company also has an agreement whereby monthly payments of approximately $12,000 are made
to one of the above mentioned limited liability partnerships, which secures future leasing rights
on a parcel of land in Colorado. Such amounts are expensed as incurred. Approximately $144,000 was
paid attributable to this agreement in the year ended December31, 2005, $132,000 in 2004 and
$156,000 in 2003. 51 Table of Contents The Company leased, for business purposes, a condominium owned by a partnership of certain
stockholders, including the Companys Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Company paid the
partnership $10,000 in 2004 and $60,000 in 2003. In February2004, this lease agreement was
terminated. Prior to 2005, the Company reimbursed expenses associated with its use of an aircraft owned by
a company, which is owned by the Companys Chairman of the Board of Directors. Aggregate payments
for the use of such aircraft were $16,000 in 2004 and $6,000 in 2003. 17CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK FORWARD CONTRACTS The Company, including its subsidiaries, enters into foreign currency
forward contracts with counterparties to mitigate foreign currency exposure from foreign currency
denominated trade purchases and intercompany receivables and payables. These derivative instruments
are not held for trading or speculative purposes. To the extent that changes occur in currency exchange rates, the Company is exposed to market
risk on its open derivative instruments. This market risk exposure is generally offset by the gain
or loss recognized upon the translation of its trade purchases and intercompany receivables and
payables. Foreign currency forward contracts are entered into with major commercial United States,
Japanese and German banks that have high credit ratings, and the Company does not expect the
counterparties to fail to meet their obligations under outstanding contracts. Foreign currency
gains and losses under these arrangements are not deferred. The Company generally enters into
foreign currency forward contracts with maturities of one month, with contracts outstanding at
December31, 2005 maturing through January2006. The Company did not seek specific hedge accounting
treatment for its foreign currency forward contracts. At December31, 2005, the Company held the following foreign currency forward contracts to buy
United States dollars and sell various foreign currencies

OTHER CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK The Company uses financial instruments that potentially
subject it to concentrations of credit risk. Such instruments include cash equivalents, short-term
investments, accounts receivable, and foreign currency forward contracts. The Company invests its
cash in cash deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, and municipal bonds and notes. The
Company places its investments with high-credit quality financial institutions and limits the
credit exposure from any one financial institution or instrument. To date, the Company has not
experienced significant losses on these investments. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally requires no collateral. Because the
Companys receivables are primarily related to companies in the semiconductor capital equipment
industry, the Company is exposed to credit risk generally related to this cyclical industry. 18STOCK PLANS As of December31, 2005, the Company had three active stock-based compensation plans; the 2003
Stock Option Plan the 2003 Plan, the 2003 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan the 2003
Directors Plan and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP. 2003 STOCK OPTION PLAN The 2003 Plan is a broad-based plan for employees, executive
officers, and consultants in which directors of the Company are not allowed to participate. The
Board of Directors currently administers this plan, and makes all decisions concerning which
employees, executive officers and consultants are granted options, how many to grant to each
optionee, when options are granted, how the plan should be properly interpreted, whether to amend
or terminate the plan, and whether to delegate administration of the plan to a committee. The 2003
Plan provides for the issuance of up to 3,250,000 shares of common stock. Shares may be issued
under the 2003 Plan on exercise of incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options granted
under the 2003 Plan or as restricted stock awards. Stock appreciation rights may also be granted
under the 2003 Plan, and the shares represented by the stock appreciation rights will be deducted
from shares issuable under the 2003 Plan. The exercise price of incentive stock options and
non-qualified stock options may not be less than the market value of the Companys common stock on
the date of grant. The administrator of the plan has the discretion to determine the vesting period
of options granted under the 2003 Plan, however option grants will generally vest over four years,
contingent upon the optionee continuing to be an employee, executive officer or consultant of the
Company. The options are exercisable for ten years from the date of grant. The 2003 Plan will
expire in 52 Table of Contents February2013, unless the administrator of the plan terminates it earlier. As of December31, 2005,
approximately 16million shares of common stock were available for grant under this plan. On January31, 2005, the Company amended the 2003 Plan to provide additional terms for the
restricted stock units. The restricted stock units generally vest as to 10% on the first
anniversary of the grant date, an additional 20% on the second anniversary of the grant date, an
additional 30% on the third anniversary of the grant date and the remaining 40% on the fourth
anniversary of the grant date. Additional terms are set forth in the individual grant agreements
between the Company and the award recipient. 2003 NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS STOCK OPTION PLAN The 2003 Directors Plan provides for the
issuance of up to 250,000 shares of common stock upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options
granted under the 2003 Directors Plan. The exercise price of options granted under the 2003
Directors Plan may not be less than the market value of the Companys common stock on the date of
grant. Prior to January26, 2006, non-employee directors were automatically granted an option to
purchase 15,000 shares on the first date elected or appointed as a member of the Companys board,
and 5,000 shares on any date re-elected as a member of the board. Options granted on the date first
elected or appointed as a member of the Companys board immediately vested as to one-third of the
shares subject to the grant, then another one-third on each of the first two anniversaries of the
date granted, provided the optionee continued to be a director. Options granted upon re-election
were immediately exercisable. On January26, 2006, the Company revised its non-employee director
compensation structure, which revisions eliminated the granting of stock options. Non-employee
directors are now granted 5,000 restricted stock units on the date first elected or appointed as a
member of the Companys board, and 2,000 restricted stock units on any date re-elected as a member
of the board. As of December31, 2005, 120,000 shares of common stock were available for grant
under this plan. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN In September1995, stockholders approved an ESPP covering an
aggregate of 200,000 shares of common stock. The Companys stockholders approved amendments to
increase the number of common shares reserved for issuance under the plan from 200,000 shares to
400,000 shares in May2003 and from 400,000 shares to 500,000 shares in May2005. Employees are
eligible to participate in the ESPP if employed by the Company for at least 20 hours per week
during at least five months per calendar year. Participating employees may have the lesser of 5%
their earnings or $1,250 per six-month period withheld pursuant to the ESPP. The purchase price of
common stock purchased under the ESPP is equal to 85% of the lower of the fair value on the
commencement date of each offering period or the relevant purchase date. Employees purchased shares
of common stock under the ESPP of approximately 45,000 shares in 2005, 65,000 in 2004 and 73,000 in
2003. At December31, 2005, approximately 145,000 shares remained available for future issuance. On April14, 2004, by resolution of the Companys Board of Directors, the Company terminated
its 2002 and 2001 Employee Stock Option Plans. Existing stock options outstanding under the 2002
and 2001 Employee Stock Option Plans remain outstanding according to their original terms. At
December31, 2005, options to purchase shares of common stock remained outstanding under the 2002
Employee Stock Option Plan of approximately 305,000 options and under the 2001 Employee Stock
Option Plan of approximately 325,000 options. On May7, 2003, the Company terminated the 1995 Employee Stock Option Plan and the
Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan upon stockholder approval of the 2003 Plan and the 2003
Directors Plan; however, existing stock options outstanding under these terminated plans remain
outstanding according to their original terms. At December31, 2005, options to purchase
approximately 11million shares of common stock remained outstanding under the 1995 Employee Stock
Option Plan and options to purchase approximately 58,000 shares of common stock remained
outstanding under the Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan. The following summarizes the activity relating to stock options for the years ended December

19FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Companys financial instruments include cash, trade receivables, trade payables,
marketable securities, short-term and long-term debt, and foreign currency forward exchange
contracts see Note 17. The fair values of cash, trade receivables, trade payables and short-term
debt approximate the carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Marketable
securities are stated at fair value see Notes 1 and 4. The carrying value of senior borrowings
approximates their fair value due to the variable interest rates associated with the borrowings. 20SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW DISCLOSURES As of December31, 2005, approximately $246million of the Companys cash balance is held in
banks outside of the United States. Cash paid receivedfor income taxes, net: In 2003, the Company received approximately
$141million in income tax refunds in the United States due primarily to its 2002 net operating
loss carry-back. Assets sold for note receivable: In the first quarter of 2004, the Company made a strategic
decision to further focus its marketing and product support resources on its core competencies and
reorient its operating infrastructure towards sustained profitability. As a result, the Company
sold its Noah chiller business to an unrelated third party for $797,000 in cash and a $19million
note receivable due March31, 2009. The note bears interest at 50%, payable annually on March31.
The sale included property and equipment with a 54 Table of Contents book value of approximately $300,000, inventory of approximately $10million, goodwill and
intangible assets net of accumulated amortization of approximately $900,000, demonstration and
customer service equipment of approximately $140,000, and estimated warranty obligations of
approximately $140,000. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of $404,000, which has been
recorded as other income and expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. In
the third quarter of 2004, the Company purchased equipment of approximately $71,000 from the buyers
of the Noah chiller assets in exchange for an equivalent reduction of the note receivable due March
31, 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company negotiated an early settlement of the note,
and as a result recorded a loss of $942,000, which was recorded as other income and expense, the
same line item as the original gain on the sale. In the second quarter of 2003, as part of the Companys ongoing cost reduction measures, the
Company committed to a plan to sell certain inventory and property and equipment assets to an
unrelated third party at their respective net book values. These assets were primarily used in the
manufacture of a component for the Companys direct current and radio frequency products and were
sold on June30, 2003. In conjunction with the sale, the Company received approximately $16
million in cash and a short-term note receivable for approximately $15million in exchange for
inventory with a carrying value of approximately $21million and property and equipment with a
carrying value of approximately $10million. 21QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA UNAUDITED The following table presents unaudited quarterly financial data for each of the eight quarters
in the period ended December31, 2005. The Company believes that all necessary adjustments have
been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly such quarterly information. The
operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent
period. The amounts below have been restated to reclassify the results of discontinued operations.

The Company had a net loss in the fourth quarter of 2004 of $230million. Pretax
charges in the fourth quarter included $92million to cost of sales for increased excess and
obsolete inventory reserves, $38million to selling, general and administrative for the change in
estimate of the useful life of the demonstration equipment see Note 1, $37million to
restructuring for employee severance and termination costs primarily attributable to the Fort
Collins facility see Note 3, $33million to impairment of intangible assets see Note 8. These
items contributed significantly to the Companys fourth quarter 2004 results. The Company increased
its reserve for excess and obsolete inventory in the fourth quarter of 2004, as a result of the
fourth quarter strategic management decision to discontinue certain product offerings, the outlook
for future periods demand and the declining trend in the Companys sales from the second quarter of
2004 to the fourth quarter of 2004. The net loss of $39million in the third quarter of 2005 included pretax charges of $32
million for debt extinguishment expenses see Note 10 and $30million for a litigation settlement
see Note 14. The net income of $100million in the fourth quarter of 2005 includes pretax gains
on the sale of discontinued operations $52million. 55 Table of Contents ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES SCHEDULE II VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, with the
participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer,
of the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to the Exchange Act Rule
13a-15b. Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December31, 2005. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. Our internal controls
over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance concerning the reliability of
financial data used in the preparation of our financial statements. All internal control systems,
no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Controls considered to be operating effectively in one period may become inadequate in future
periods because of changes in conditions or a deterioration in the degree of compliance with
policies or procedures. Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, assessed
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 using
the criteria described in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of the assessment, Management has
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2005. Grant Thornton LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an
attestation report on both managements assessment and the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting, which is included in PartII, Item8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. 56 Table of Contents Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
our most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the internal control over financial reporting, except for steps taken to remediate the
material weaknesses described immediately below. Remediation of Material Weaknesses As disclosed in our 2004 annual report on Form 10-K, management had identified a material
weakness related to the lack of segregation of duties defined within our enterprise resource
planning ERP system, as certain employees had access in our ERP system to record transactions
outside of their assigned job responsibilities. The ERP system interacts with most of our major
processes including manufacturing, payables, receivables and inventory controls. Management has
taken the following steps in remediating this material weakness   
Reassigned access in the ERP system for each employee to be more consistent with his or her job responsibilities   
Reviewed and tested the reassigned access to identify and assess segregation of duties issues   
Hired an independent consulting firm to review and test the reassigned access to determine if the reassigned
access establishes appropriate segregation of duties and to advise management accordingly; and   
Implemented a policy whereby proposed changes to the assigned access for each employee must be reviewed and
approved by management prior to implementation to aid in preventing future segregation of duty issues. Management has reviewed and tested the reassigned access and has concluded that the material
weakness no longer exists as of December31, 2005. Also disclosed in our 2004 annual report on Form 10-K was managements identification of two
significant deficiencies in our Japan operations, which when considered together represented a
material weakness. The first significant deficiency related to the fact that both of our Japan
facilities have their own unique information system, neither of which was the corporate ERP system
discussed above but both of which had similar segregation of duties issues. The second significant
deficiency in Japan was the lack of sufficient human resources for proper segregation of duties and
oversight at the local level. Management has taken the following steps in remediating this
material weakness in our Japan operations   
Relocated a division controller from the corporate
headquarters to Japan to provide oversight at the local
level and hired a President and Representative Director of
Japan; and   
Implemented the corporate ERP system in Japan, including
training the staff in Japan. Through the implementation of
the corporate ERP system in Japan, management also ensured
that proper segregation of duties was defined within the
system. Management has reviewed and tested the system implementation and has concluded that the
material weakness no longer exists as of December31, 2005.
