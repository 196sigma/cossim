FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA MANAGEMENTS
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting as defined in Rules13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the board of directors regarding the preparation
and fair presentation of published financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide
only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December31, 2008, our
internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2008 has been audited by Schneider Downs Co. Inc., an independent registered public accounting firm which also audited our consolidated financial statements. Schneider Downs attestation report on the consolidated
financial statements and managements maintenance of effective internal control over financial reporting is included under the heading Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.  /s/Dennis M. Oates /s/Richard M. Ubinger

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Universal Stainless Alloy Products, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Universal Stainless Alloy Products, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated
statements of operations and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2008. In addition, our audit included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at  2Schedule II. We also
have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2008, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the consolidated financial statements, as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.  /s/ Schneider Downs Co., Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies Description of the Company. Universal Stainless Alloy
Products, Inc. the Company manufactures and markets semi-finished and finished specialty steel products, including stainless steel, tool steel and certain other alloyed steels. The Companys manufacturing process involves melting,
remelting, treating, and hot and cold rolling of semi-finished and finished specialty steels. The Companys products are sold to rerollers, forgers, service centers, original equipment manufacturers OEMs, which primarily include
the power generation and aerospace industries, and wire redrawers. The Company also performs conversion services on materials supplied by customers that lack certain of the Companys production facilities or that are subject to their own
capacity constraints. Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. The estimates and assumptions used in these consolidated financial statements are based on
known information available as of the balance sheet date. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Basis of Consolidation. The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company has no interests in any unconsolidated entity nor
does it have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases. FairValue of Financial Instruments. Cash equivalents are
stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates market value, and include cash and securities having a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. The fair value of trade receivables and trade payables approximate the carrying
amount because of the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of long-term debt instruments approximates the carrying amount based on current borrowing rates available for financings with similar terms and maturities. Concentration of Credit Risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are cash and cash equivalents and
accounts receivable. The Company limits its credit risk associated with cash and cash equivalents by placing its investments in high-grade short-term instruments. With respect to accounts receivable, the Company limits its credit risk by performing
ongoing credit evaluations and, when deemed necessary, requiring letters of credit, guarantees or cash collateral. The allowance for doubtful accounts includes specific reserves for the value of outstanding invoices issued to customers currently
operating under the protection of the federal bankruptcy law and other amounts that are deemed potentially not collectible with a reserve equal to 15% of 90-day or older balances. However, the total allowance will not be less than 1% of total
accounts receivable. Receivables are charged-off to the allowance when they are deemed to be uncollectible. Bad debt expense for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $13,000, $2,000 and $78,000, respectively. Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost principally determined by the first-in, first-out FIFO method. The average cost
method is also utilized. Such costs include the acquisition cost for raw materials and supplies, direct labor and applied manufacturing overhead within the guidelines of normal plant capacity. Provisions are made for slow-moving inventory based upon
managements expected method of disposition. Net provision expense for inventory reserves for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $10 million, $619,000 and $939,000, respectively. The Company purchases scrap metal and alloy additives, principally nickel, chrome and molybdenum, for its melting operation. A substantial portion of the alloy additives is available only from foreign sources, some of
which are located in countries that may be subject to unstable political and economic conditions. Those conditions might disrupt supplies or affect the prices of the raw materials used by the Company. The Company maintains sales price surcharges to
help offset the impact of raw material price fluctuations. Included in inventory are operating materials consisting of production molds and rolls that
will normally be consumed within one year. Property, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost. Costs incurred in
connection with the construction or major rebuild of facilities, including interest directly related to the project, are capitalized as construction in progress. No depreciation is recognized on these assets until placed in service. Retirements and
disposals are removed from cost and accumulated depreciation accounts, with the gain or loss reflected in operating income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and costs of improvements and renewals are capitalized.
In September2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB Staff Position entitled Accounting for Planned Major
Maintenance Activities FSP. The FSP amends an American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Industry Audit Guide and is applicable to all industries that accrue for planned major maintenance activities. The FSP prohibits the
use of the accrue-in-advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance costs, which was the policy the Company used to record planned plant outage costs on an interim basis within a fiscal year. The FSP became effective January1,
2007, with retrospective application to all prior periods presented. Under the FSP, the Company will report results using the deferral method whereby material major equipment maintenance costs are capitalized as incurred and amortized into expense
over the subsequent six-month period, while other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The restatement of maintenance expenses for the year ended December31, 2006 changed previously reported financial data by the following amounts:
Increase Decrease in Previously Reported Amount
2006 dollars in thousands, except per share amounts Change in cost of products sold 40 Change in net income 24 Change in earnings per common share Basic 001 Diluted 001 
- 24 - Table of Contents
Maintenance expense for the fiscal year 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $14,556,000, $13,857,000 and $12,060,000, respectively.
Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful
lives of buildings and land improvements are between 10 and 39 years, and the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment are between 10 and 20 years. Direct costs incurred in the development and implementation of internal-use software are
capitalized and recorded within property, plant and equipment, and amortized on a straight-line basis over its anticipated useful life, which generally does not exceed three years. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal year 2008, 2007 and
2006 was $4,148,000, $3,722,000 and $3,315,000, respectively. Long-Lived Asset Impairment. Long-lived assets, including property, plant and
equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in relation to the operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying
assets. Adjustments are made if the sum of expected future cash flows is less than book value. At December31, 2008, the Companys stock price was below book value per share. In managements judgment, a significant portion of the
recent decline in the Companys stock price is related to the current unprecedented liquidity crisis in the overall economy and is not reflective of the underlying cash flows of the Company. Based on managements assessment of the carrying
values of long-lived assets, no impairment reserve had been deemed necessary as of December31, 2008 and 2007. Revenue Recognition. Revenue
from the sale of products is recognized when both risk of loss and title have transferred to the customer, which in most cases coincides with shipment of the related products, and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue from conversion services is
recognized when the performance of the service is complete. Invoiced shipping and handling costs are also accounted for as revenue. The Company manufactures specialty steel product to customer purchase order specifications and in recognition of
requirements for product acceptance. Material certification forms are executed, indicating compliance with the customer purchase orders, before the specialty steel products are packed and shipped to the customer. Occasionally customers request that
the packed products be held at the Companys facility beyond the stated shipment date. In these situations, the Company receives written confirmation of the request, and acknowledgement that title has passed to the customer and that normal
payment terms apply. Such amounts included in revenue for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were less than 1% of net sales. Customer claims, which are not material, are accounted for primarily as a reduction to gross sales after
the matter has been researched and an acceptable resolution has been reached. Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for unused tax
credits earned and the tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. The Company uses the liability method to account for income taxes, which requires
deferred taxes to be recorded at the statutory rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid. Valuation allowances are provided for a deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized. In addition, the Company evaluates the tax positions taken or expected to be taken in its tax returns. A tax position should only be recognized in the financial
statements if the Company determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities, based upon the technical merits of the position. For those tax positions that should be recognized,
the measurement of a tax position is determined as being the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company believes there are no known uncertain tax positions at
December31, 2008. Stock-Based Compensation Plans. On January1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
StandardsNo123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R using a modified version of prospective application modified prospective application. SFAS123R applies to new awards and to
awards modified, repurchased or cancelled after January1, 2006. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service period has not yet been rendered based on the grant-date fair
value of the awards. The fair value of the option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and is recognized ratably over the service/vesting period of the award. The tax effects of exercising stock
options are added to additional paid-in capital at the exercise date. Earnings Per Common Share. Basic earnings per common share is computed by
dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus all dilutive
potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive common shares are determined using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, exercise of options is assumed at the beginning of the period when the average stock price
during the period exceeds the exercise price of outstanding 
- 25 - Table of Contents
options, and common shares are assumed issued. The assumed proceeds from the exercise of stock options are used to purchase common stock at the average
market price during the period. The incremental shares to be issued are considered to be the dilutive potential common shares outstanding. New
Accounting Pronouncements. The Company adopted FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157 and FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No159, The
Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No115 SFAS 159, which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at
fair value. Neither of these statements had an impact on results for 2008. In February2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No157 which delayed the effective date of SFAS
No157 for all non-financial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, until January1, 2009. We have not yet conclusively determined the impact
that the implementation of SFAS No157 will have on our non-financial assets and liabilities; however we do not anticipate it to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. On December4, 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No141 Revised 2007, Business Combinations SFAS 141R. SFAS 141R will
significantly change the accounting for business combinations. Under SFAS 141R, an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited
exceptions. SFAS 141R will change the accounting treatment for certain specific items, including: acquisition costs will be generally expensed as incurred; noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date; acquired
contingent liabilities will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for non-acquired contingencies; restructuring costs
associated with a business combination will be generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax
expense. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after January1, 2009. On December4, 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial StatementsAn Amendment of ARB
No51 SFAS 160. SFAS 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this statement requires the
recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parents equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in
consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. SFAS 160 clarifies that changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling
financial interest. In addition, this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the
deconsolidation date. SFAS 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. SFAS 160 is effective on January1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on
the Companys financial statements. In March, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement No161, Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities, an Amendment of FASB Statement No133.SFAS 161. SFAS161 amends SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to amend and expand the disclosure requirements of
SFAS133 to provide greater transparency about ihow and why an entity uses derivative instruments, iihow derivative instruments and related hedge items are accounted for under SFAS133 and its related interpretations, and
iiihow derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. To meet those objectives, SFAS161 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies
for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. SFAS161 is effective on
January1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements. Reclassifications.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2008 presentation.

Line, all of which is available for borrowing at December31, 2008, with a term expiring on June30, 2009. This credit agreement also included a term loan PNC Term Loan scheduled to mature on June30, 2011. The
Company retired the PNC Term Loan in December 2007. The credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all of the Companys assets. Interest on
borrowings under the PNC Line is based on short-term market rates, which may be further adjusted, based upon the Company maintaining certain financial ratios. PNC Bank reduced the commitment fee paid on the unused portion of the PNC Line from 05%
to 025%, provided certain financial ratios are maintained. The Company is required to be in compliance with three financial covenants: a minimum leverage ratio, a minimum debt service ratio and a minimum tangible net worth. The Company was in
compliance with all financial ratios and restrictive covenants it is required to maintain under the credit agreement at December31, 2008. On
February27, 2009, the Company entered into a new unsecured credit agreement providing for a $120 million term loan scheduled to mature on February28, 2014 and a $150 million revolving credit facility with a term expiring on
June30, 2012. The Company also executed an interest rate swap to convert the LIBOR floating rate term loan to a fixed interest rate for the life of the loan. The Company maintains two separate loan agreements with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvanias Department of Commerce, aggregating $600,000. A $200,000 15-year loan bears interest at 5%per annum with the term ending in 2011 and a
$400,000 20-year loan bears interest at 6%per annum with the term ending in 2016. On February14, 2002, Dunkirk Specialty Steel issued two ten-year, 5% interest-bearing notes payable to the New York Job Development Authority for the
combined amount of $30 million. The Company leases certain office equipment and a vehicle. The aggregate annual principal payments due under the

and employees hired at the Dunkirk, New York facility for up to 15 years from its 2002 acquisition date. The Company recognized tax credit benefits of $764,000 and $591,000 for fiscal year 2008 and 2007, respectively, of which $394,000 and $252,000
was applied against the respective years current tax provision. The balance of the credits, which have no expiration date, will be applied against future tax liabilities for income apportioned to New York State. The Company believes it will
generate sufficient income in addition to taxable income generated from the reversal of its temporary differences to utilize this tax credit. The Company
also recognized Pennsylvania Educational Improvement Tax Credit benefits PAEIT of $180,000 for both 2008 and 2007, which were applied against each respective years current tax provision. Deferred taxes result from the following:  December31 2008

The Company is routinely under audit by federal or state authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of
sales and use taxes. These audits include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. The Company has settled all IRS examinations through
December31, 2004. Note 6: Stockholders Equity The Company has never paid a cash dividend on its Common Stock. The Companys Credit Agreement with PNC Bank limits the payment of cash dividends payable on its Common Stock to 50% of the Companys excess cash flow per fiscal
year. Excess cash flow represents the amount of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization that is greater than the sum of the Companys payments for interest, income taxes, the principal portion of long-term debt and
capital lease obligations, and capital expenditures.  CommonSharesOutstanding

Note 8: Stock-Based Compensation Plans At December31, 2008, the Company has three incentive compensation plans that are described below: STOCK INCENTIVE
PLAN The Company maintains the Stock Incentive Plan that has been adopted and amended from time to time by the Companys Board of Directors, and
approved by its stockholders. The Stock Incentive Plan permits the issuance of stock options to non-employee directors, other than those directors owning more than 5% of the Companys outstanding Common Stock, officers and other key employees
of the Company who are expected to contribute to the Companys future growth and success. The Company may grant options up to a maximum of 1,350,000 shares of Common Stock, of which 252,918 are available for grant at December31, 2008. The
option price is equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock at the date of grant. Options granted to non-employee directors vest over a three-year period, and options granted to employees vest over a four-year period. All options under the
Stock Incentive Plan will expire no later than ten years after the grant date. Forfeited options may be reissued and are included in the amount available for grants. A summary of the Stock Incentive Plan activity as of and for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is presented below:  SharesAvailablefor Grant

38 Proceeds from stock option exercises totaled $625,000 in 2008, $898,000 in 2007 and $14million in 2006.
Shares issued in connection with stock option exercises are issued from available authorized shares. Tax benefits realized from stock options exercised totaled $529,000 in 2008, $958,000 in 2007 and $11 million in 2006. 
- 30 - Table of Contents
Based upon the closing stock price of $1449 at December31, 2008, the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding
in-the-money stock options and outstanding exercisable in-the-money stock options was $888,000 and $865,000, respectively. Intrinsic value of stock options is calculated as the amount by which the market price of USAP common stock exceeds the
exercise price of the options. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $15million in 2008, $26million in 2007 and $28million in 2006. The total fair value of share awards vested was $759,000 during 2008 328,000 in 2007 and $327,000 in 2006. Stock-Based Compensation Expense. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS123R on January1,
2006. SFAS123R requires that stock-based compensation to employees and directors be recognized as compensation expense in the income statement based on their fair values on the measurement date, which, for the Company, is the date of the
grant. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. The compensation expense recognized and its related tax effects are included in additional paid-in capital.
Additional paid-in capital is further adjusted for the difference between compensation expense recorded under SFAS 123R and compensation expense reported for tax purposes upon actual exercise of employee stock options. Stock-based compensation expense totaled $838,000 in 2008 and $427,000 in 2007. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period
for all awards. The tax benefit associated with the stock compensation expense recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations was $305,000 in 2008 and $152,000 in 2007. Unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to
non-vested stock awards totaled $2,361,000 at December31, 2008. At such date, the weighted-average period over which this unrecognized expense was expected to be recognized was 34 months. Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation. The fair value of the Companys employee stock options granted is estimated on the measurement date, which, for the
Company, is the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The weighted-average fair value of stock options granted was $2,420,000 for 2008, $2,689,000 for 2007, and $554,000 for 2006. The Companys determination of
fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant is affected by the Companys stock price as well as assumptions regarding the Companys expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected
employee stock option exercise behaviors. The assumptions used to determine the fair value of options granted are detailed in the table below: 2008 2007 2006 Risk-free interest rate

479 476  Expected term
58to82years 58to82years 50 years The risk-free interest rate was developed using the U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods equal to the expected
life of the options at the grant date. No dividend yield was assumed because the Company does not pay cash dividends on Common Stock and currently has no plans to pay a dividend. Expected volatility is based on the long-term historical volatility
estimated over a period equal to the expected term of the options of the Companys stock. In estimating the fair value of stock options under the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, separate groups of employees that have similar historical
exercise behavior are considered separately. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN Under the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Stock Purchase Plan, the Company
is authorized to issue up to 90,000 shares of Common Stock to its full-time employees, nearly all of whom are eligible to participate. At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company held May17, 2006, shareholders approved an amendment to
the Stock Purchase Plan to reserve an additional 60,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance under the plan. Under the terms of the plan, employees can choose as of January1 and July1 of each year to have up to 10% of their total earnings
withheld to purchase up to 100 shares of the Companys Common Stock each six-month period. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of its beginning-of-the-period or end-of-the-period market prices. At December31, 2008, the
Company has issued 104,247 shares of Common Stock since the plans inception. CASH INCENTIVE PLANS The Company has a management cash incentive plan covering certain key executives and employees and profit-sharing plans that cover the remaining employees. The
profit-sharing plans provide for the sharing of pre-tax profits in excess of specified amounts. For the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company expensed $3,484,000, $5,823,000 and $5,285,000, respectively, under these plans.

Note 9: Retirement Plans The Company has defined contribution retirement plans that cover substantially all employees. The Company accrues its contributions to the hourly employee plan based on time worked while contributions to the salaried plan are accrued as a
fixed amount per month. Company contributions to both plans are funded periodically. Effective January6, 2003, the Company began to participate in
the Steelworkers Pension Trust Trust, a multi-employer defined-benefit pension plan that is open to all hourly and salaried employees associated with the Bridgeville facility. The Company makes periodic contributions to the Trust based
on hours worked at a fixed rate for each hourly employee and a fixed monthly contribution on behalf of each salaried employee. The hourly employees may continue their contributions to the defined contribution retirement plan even if the Company
contributions cease. The company has the option and right to terminate participation in the Trust if the withdrawal liability ratio of assets to liabilities is below 100%. The Company also makes a contribution to the defined contribution retirement plan on behalf of each salaried employee participating in the Trust. The amount of the contribution for salaried employees will be dependent
upon their contribution to the 401k retirement plan. The total expense for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $972,000, $873,000
and $888,000, respectively, including $494,000, $531,000 and $572,000, respectively, for the multi-employer Trust. No other post-retirement benefit plans exist. Note 10: Commitments and Contingencies From time to time, various lawsuits and claims have been or may be asserted against the Company
relating to the conduct of our business, including routine litigation relating to commercial and employment matters. In May 2007, the Company settled a product claim lawsuit. The net impact of this settlement, including professional fees, on the
Companys net income after tax was $517,000. The ultimate cost and outcome of any litigation or claim cannot be predicted with certainty. Management believes, based on information presently available, that the likelihood that the ultimate
outcome of any such pending matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, or liquidity or a material impact to our results of operations is remote, although the resolution of one or more of these matters may have a material
adverse effect on its results of operations for the period in which the resolution occurs. The Company, as well as other steel companies, is subject to
demanding environmental standards imposed by federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. The Company is not aware of any environmental condition that currently exists at any of its facilities that would cause a material adverse
effect on the financial condition of the Company, results of operations or liquidity in a particular future quarter or year. The CDSOA provides for
payment of import duties collected by the U.S. Treasury to domestic companies injured by unfair foreign trade practices. In accordance with the CDSOA, which expired in 2007, the Company filed claims to receive its appropriate share of the import
duties collected. In 2006, 2007 and 2008 the Company received $463,000, $586,000 and $599,000, respectively, from the U.S. Treasury net of expenses incurred. Future benefits are dependent on the amount of undistributed import duties collected as of
September30, 2007 and the relationship of Dunkirk Specialty Steels claim in relation to claims filed by other domestic specialty steel producers. The Companys purchase obligations include the value of all open purchase orders with established quantities and purchase prices, as well as minimum purchase commitments, all made in the normal course of business. At December31,
2008, the Companys total purchase obligations were $13,628,000, all of which will be due in year 2009. On January29, 2009, the Company
announced that it will invest $13 million in its Bridgeville melt shop. The investment will include major upgrades in equipment, automation and plant layout designed to: cut production cycle times and customer lead times; improve on-time delivery
performance; increase material yields; reduce operating costs and enhance working capital management. The equipment and infrastructure spending will be completed by the end of 2009, and the automation investment will be completed by the middle of
2010. The project is expected to begin producing cost savings in the 2009 fourth quarter. Once fully implemented, the investment is expected to yield cost savings of more than $75 million per year. The Company expects to fund substantially all of
the investment with a bank term loan. Note 11: Segment and Related Information The Company is comprised of three operating locations and one corporate headquarters. For segment reporting, the Bridgeville and Titusville facilities have been aggregated into one reportable segment, Universal
Stainless Alloy Products, because of the management reporting structure in place. The Universal Stainless Alloy Products manufacturing process involves melting, remelting, treating and hot and cold rolling of semi-finished and
finished specialty steels. A second reportable segment, Dunkirk Specialty Steel has a manufacturing process involving hot rolling and finishing specialty steel bar, rod and wire products. At December31, 2008, 81% of the Companys 514 employees are covered by USW collective bargaining agreements. The accounting policies of both reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies. Sales between the segments are generally
made at market-related prices. Corporate assets are primarily cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, deferred income taxes, and property, plant and equipment.

shipped, fueled by a 136% increase in shipments to forgers destined for the global power generation markets, offset by lower surcharges and a 5% decline in aerospace sales through service centers. In total, sales to service centers declined 21% from
the 2007 fourth quarter. The Companys 2008 fourth quarter earnings were negatively impacted by an increase in inventory reserves of $807,000 and were positively impacted by the receipt of import duties of $599,000 and a reduction in the annual
income tax rate to 299% from 327%. The change in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to the impact of the lower income level on the Companys permanent tax deductions and favorable adjustments to state income provisions.
Nickel costs declined from the third to fourth quarter of 2007.The impact from the change in nickel costs combined with lower total shipment volume
reduced company-wide gross margin dollars in the fourth quarter 2007. The Companys 2007 fourth quarter earnings were positively impacted by the receipt of import duties of $586,000 and a reduction in the annual income tax rate to 327% from
342%. The change in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to adjustments to state income provisions and tax credits as well as the impact of recognizing a $180,000 tax credit in Pennsylvania as a result of participating in the states
PAEIT in the fourth quarter 2007. Earnings per share amounts for each quarter are required to be computed independently. As a result, their sum may not
equal the total year earnings per share amounts.

limits specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed by the Company is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure. Managements
Report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting is included in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and is
incorporated herein by reference. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report on managements maintenance of effective internal control over financial reporting and is set forth in Item8 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm and is incorporated herein by reference. During the last fiscal quarter of the fiscal year ended December31, 2008, there were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.  ITEM9B.
