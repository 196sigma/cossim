Subsidiaries and the other information contained in the 10-K Annual Report were
prepared by and are the responsibility of management. The Statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
necessarily include amounts based on management best estimates and judgments.
In fulfilling its responsibilities, management relies on a system of internal
controls, which provide reasonable assurance that the financial records are
reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability of
assets. Internal controls are designed to reduce the risk that material errors
or irregularities in the financial statements may occur and not be timely
detected. These systems are augmented by written policies, careful selection and
training of qualified personnel, an organizational structure providing for the
division of responsibilities and a program of financial, operational and systems
reviews.
The Audit Committee, composed of non-employee directors, is responsible for
recommending to the Board of Directors, the independent accounting firm to be
retained each year. The Audit Committee meets regularly, and when appropriate
separately, with the independent certified accountants and management to review
Company performance. The independent certified public accountants and the Audit
Committee have unrestricted access to each other in the discharge of their
responsibilities.   /S/ JOHN P. WILMERS

Board of Directors and Shareholders
Ballantyne of Omaha, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ballantyne of
Omaha, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 1999.
In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we
have also audited the financial statement schedule for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 1999. These consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of Ballantyne of Omaha, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998,
and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1999, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly, in all material respects the information set forth therein.

financial statements are based are summarized as follows a.  Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.
b.  Stock Dividend and Splits
The Company Board of Directors declared a 5% stock dividend of the Company
common stock on January 28, 1999. The stock dividend was payable March 1, 1999
to shareholders of record on February 15, 1999. The stock dividend resulted in
the issuance of 601,455 shares of common stock. The dividend was accounted for
as if it occurred on December 31, 1998.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued d.  Goodwill and Other Intangibles
The Company capitalizes and includes in other assets the excess of cost over
the fair value of assets of business acquired Goodwill, the present value
of non-compete agreements and the costs of acquiring patents on its products.
These assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected periods to be benefited,
3 to 25 years. Accumulated amortization as of December 31, 1999 and 1998
amounted to $1,344,531 and $928,393, respectively. The balance of Goodwill
included in other assets, net of accumulated amortization, was $2,990,865 and
$3,240,213 as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The Company
assesses and would recognize any deficiency of the recoverability of Goodwill
by determining whether the amortization of the asset balance over its
remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash
flows of the acquired operations.
e.  Plant and Equipment
Significant expenditures for the replacement or expansion of plant and equipment
are capitalized. Depreciation of plant and equipment is provided over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets using the straight-line method.
Estimated useful lives range from 3 to 20 years.
f.  Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating
loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
g.  Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment to the customer.
Revenues related to equipment rental and services are recognized as earned over
the terms of the contracts.
h.  Research and Development
Research and development costs are charged to operations in the period incurred.
Such costs charged to operations amounted to approximately $846,000, $746,000
and $647,000 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
i.  Advertising Costs
Advertising and promotional costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to
approximately $1,160,000, $1,046,000 and $904,000 for the years ended December
31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.                    -29          Ballantyne of Omaha, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued j.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instruments
could be exchanged into a current transaction between willing parties. Cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivable, debt, notes payable to bank and accounts
payable reported in the consolidated balance sheets equal or approximate fair
values.
k.  Use of Estimates
Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions
relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these consolidated financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
l.  Cash and Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid financial instruments with maturities of three months or less
from date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents in the consolidated
balance sheets and statements of cash flows.
m.  Earnings Per Common Share
Basic earnings per share of common stock have been computed on the basis of the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings
per share has been computed on the basis of the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding after giving effect to potential common
shares from dilutive stock options. Diluted earnings per share includes an
increase in the weighted average shares outstanding for dilutive stock options
of 559,635, 650,859 and 976,119 for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
n.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of
The Company reviews long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to
be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset
to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets
are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by
the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of
the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying
amount or fair value less costs to sell.
o. Comprehensive Income
The Company comprehensive income consists solely of net income. The Company
had no other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998
and 1997.                    -30          Ballantyne of Omaha, Inc. and Subsidiaries

a.  Profit Sharing Plan
The Company has in place a profit sharing plan for key management employees.
Amounts due pursuant to the plan are based upon the attainment of specific
operating levels that are established by the Board of Directors. Amounts charged
to operations pursuant to the profit sharing plan amounted to $863,635, $945,562
and $1,127,795 for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The amounts payable of
$871,253 and $945,818 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, are included
in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
b.  Retirement Plans
The Company sponsors a defined contribution 401-K plan the Plan for all
employees. Pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, employees may defer up to 6%
of their compensation. The Company will match 50% of the amount deferred. An
additional amount of up to 9% of the employee compensation for the year may
also be deferred with no matching contribution by the Company. The contributions
made to the Plan by the Company for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and
1997 amounted to $295,858, $182,077 and $150,577, respectively.                    -38          Ballantyne of Omaha, Inc. and Subsidiaries

c.  Concentrations
For the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, sales to a customer
represented approximately sixteen percent 16%, fifteen percent 15% and
twenty percent 20% of consolidated net revenues, respectively. The balance in
trade receivables owed by this customer was $1,569,953 at December 31, 1999 and
$751,233 at December 31, 1998. For the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998,
sales to another customer represented approximately twenty-one percent 21% and
fourteen percent 14% of consolidated net revenues, respectively. The balance
in trade receivables owed by this customer was $972,301 at December 31, 1999 and
$1,888,594 at December 31, 1998. Financial instruments that potentially expose
the Company to a concentration of credit risk principally consist of accounts
receivable. The Company sells product to a large number of customers in many
different geographic regions. To minimize credit concentration risk, the Company
performs on going credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition. The
Company utilizes a single contract manufacturer for each of its intermittent
movement components and lenses for its commercial motion picture projection
equipment and aluminum kettles for its pressure fryers. Although the Company has
not to-date experienced a significant difficulty in obtaining these components,
no assurance can be given that shortages will not arise in the future. The loss
of any one or more of such contract manufacturers could have a short-term
adverse effect on the Company until alternative manufacturing arrangements were
secured.
Sales to foreign customers were approximately $16,500,000, $22,000,000 and
$18,500,000 for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. These sales were principally
to customers in Mexico, Canada, Europe and Asia. To minimize credit risk, the
Company generally requires sales to foreign customers be guaranteed by letter of
credit or are shipped C.O.D.
d.  Leases
The Company leases rental facilities and office space from an employee of a
wholly-owned subsidiary. The lease expires on March 31, 2002 with the Company
having the option to renew the lease for one additional five-year term. The
Company expects to renew or replace this lease in the ordinary course of
business. The Company also leases other properties and equipment under operating
leases which contain renewal and escalation clauses.
Aggregate minimum rental commitments for leases having noncancelable lease terms
of more than one year are as follows: 2000 - $338,915; 2001 - $320,956; 2002 193,780 and 2003 - $76,602.
e.  Self-insurance
The Company is self-insured up to certain stop loss limits for group health
insurance the Plan. Accruals for claims incurred but not paid as of December
31, 1999 are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.                    -39          Ballantyne of Omaha, Inc. and Subsidiaries

f.  Change in Control Agreement
The Company has entered into Change in Control employment agreements with its
executive officers. According to the agreements, upon a Change in Control, as
defined, the employee will receive certain severance payments.
g.  Litigation
The Company is involved in certain pending litigation arising under the normal
course of business. Management believes the ultimate resolution of these matters
will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements
of the Company.
13. Business Segment Information
The presentation of segment information reflects the manner in which management
organizes segments for making operating decisions and assessing performance.
The Company operations are conducted principally through three business
segments: Theatre, Lighting and Restaurant. Theatre operations include the
design, manufacture, assembly and sale of motion picture projectors, xenon
lamphouses and power supplies, sound systems and the sale of film handling
equipment and lenses for the theatre exhibition industry. The lighting
segment operations include the sale and rental of follow spotlights,
stationary searchlights and computer operated lighting systems for the motion
picture production, television, live entertainment, theme parks and
architectural industries. The lighting segment also includes design
consulting, rental services and equipment sales in the audio-visual industry.
The restaurant segment includes the design, manufacture, assembly and sale of
pressure fryers, smoke ovens and rotisseries and the sale of seasonings,
marinades and barbecue sauces, mesquite and hickory woods and point of
purchase displays.
The Company allocates resources to business segments and evaluates the
performance of these segments based upon reported segment gross profit. However,
certain key operations of a particular segment are tracked on the basis of
operating profit. There are no significant intersegment sales. All intersegment
transfers are recorded at historical cost.                    -40          Ballantyne of Omaha, Inc. and Subsidiaries
