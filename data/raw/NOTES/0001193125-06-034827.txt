Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Note A. Business Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  1. About NSTAR  NSTAR or the Company is a holding company engaged through its subsidiaries in the energy delivery business serving approximately 14million customers in
Massachusetts, including approximately 11million electric distribution customers in 81 communities and approximately 300,000 natural gas distribution customers in 51 communities. NSTARs retail utility subsidiaries are Boston Edison
Company Boston Edison, Commonwealth Electric Company ComElectric, Cambridge Electric Light Company Cambridge Electric and NSTAR Gas Company NSTAR Gas. Its wholesale electric subsidiary is Canal Electric Company Canal. NSTARs three
retail electric companies collectively operate as NSTAR Electric. Reference in this report to NSTAR shall mean the registrant NSTAR or NSTAR and its subsidiaries as the context requires. Reference in this report to
NSTAR Electric shall mean Boston Edison, ComElectric and Cambridge Electric together. NSTARs non-utility, unregulated operations include district energy operations through its Advanced Energy Systems, Inc. subsidiary AES,
telecommunications operations NSTAR Communications, Inc. NSTAR Com and a liquefied natural gas service company Hopkinton LNG Corp. Utility operations accounted for approximately 96% of consolidated operating revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003.
2.Basis of Consolidation and Accounting
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the results of
operations, comprehensive income, retained earnings, financial position and cash flows of NSTAR and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Effective September30, 2005, NSTAR changed
its classification of goodwill to a regulatory asset on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. For more information refer to Note D. Certain other immaterial reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the
current years presentation.  NSTARs utility subsidiaries follow
accounting policies prescribed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC and the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy MDTE. In addition, NSTAR and its subsidiaries are subject to the accounting and reporting
requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP. The utility subsidiaries are subject to the
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation SFAS 71. The application of SFAS 71 results in differences in
the timing of recognition of certain expenses from those of other businesses and industries. The distribution and transmission businesses remain subject to rate-regulation and continue to meet the criteria for application of SFAS 71. Refer to
Note E to these Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on regulatory assets.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management of NSTAR and its subsidiaries to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  3.Revenues  Utility revenues are based on authorized rates approved by the MDTE and FERC. Estimates of
distribution and transmission revenues for electricity and natural gas delivered to customers but not yet billed are accrued at the end of each accounting period.  Revenues for NSTARs non-utility subsidiaries are recognized when services are rendered or when the energy is delivered. 
53 Table of Contents
4.Utility Plant  Utility plant is stated at original cost. The cost of replacements of property units is capitalized. Maintenance and repairs and
replacements of certain items are expensed as incurred. The original cost of property retired, net of salvage value, is charged to accumulated depreciation. The incurred related cost of removal is charged against the Regulatory liability - cost of
removal. The following is a summary of utility property and equipment, at cost, at December31:  in thousands

its net realizable value. The following is a summary of non-utility property and equipment, at cost less accumulated depreciation, at December31:  in thousands
2005 2004 Land 15,710 15,700 Energy production equipment 132,564 136,929 Telecommunications equipment 40,120 39,287 Buildings and improvements 1,364 2,992 189,758 194,908 Less: accumulated depreciation 51,536 51,218 138,222 143,690 Construction work in progress 458 138,222 144,148  6.Depreciation  Depreciation of utility plant is computed on a
straight-line basis using composite rates based on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property. The composite rates are subject to the approval of the MDTE and FERC. The overall composite depreciation rates for utility property
were 303%, 302% and 304% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The rates include a cost of removal component, which is collected from customers. Depreciation expense on utility plant for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $1414 million, $134 million and
$1268 million, respectively.

Depreciation of non-utility property is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset. The
estimated depreciable service lives in years of the major components of non-utility property and equipment are as follows:  Plant Component

Buildings and improvements

Depreciation expense on non-utility
property and equipment was $89 million, $92 million and $83 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  7.Costs Associated with Issuance and Redemption of Debt and Preferred Stock  Consistent with the recovery in utility rates, discounts, redemption premiums and related
costs associated with the issuance and redemption of long-term debt and preferred stock are deferred and amortized as an addition to interest expense over the life of the original or replacement debt. Costs related to preferred stock issuances and
redemptions are reflected as a direct reduction to retained earnings upon redemption or over the average life of the replacement preferred stock series as applicable.  8.Allowance for Borrowed Funds Used During Construction AFUDC/Capitalized Interest  AFUDC represents the estimated costs to finance utility plant construction. In accordance
with regulatory accounting, AFUDC is included as a cost of utility plant and a reduction of current interest charges. Although AFUDC is not a current source of cash income, the costs are recovered from customers over the service life of the related
plant in the form of increased revenues collected as a result of higher depreciation expense. Average AFUDC rates in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were 375%, 172% and 160%, respectively, and represented only the costs of short-term debt. The 2005 rate
increase is directly related to an increase in short-term borrowing rates.  NSTAR capitalizes interest costs on long-term construction projects related to its unregulated businesses. Interest costs of $37 million during 2003 were capitalized for the construction of new combustion turbines at AES MATEP
facility. No interest costs were capitalized during 2005 and 2004.  9.Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash  Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at December31, 2005 are comprised of liquid securities with maturities of 90 days or less when purchased. Restricted cash primarily represents the funds held by a trustee in connection with
Advanced Energy Systems 6924% Note Agreement, and funds held in reserve for a trust on behalf of Boston Edison and ComElectric to pay the principal and interest on the transition property securitization.  NSTARs banking arrangements provide for daily cash transfers to its disbursement
accounts as vendor checks are presented for payment. The balances of the disbursement accounts amount to in thousands $22,062 and $26,165 at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and are included in accounts payable on the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the balances of the disbursement accounts are reflected in financing activities in the accompanying Statements of Cash Flows.

10.Equity Method of Accounting  NSTAR uses the equity method of accounting for investments in corporate joint ventures in
which it does not have a controlling interest. Under this method, it records as income or loss the proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of the joint ventures with a corresponding increase or decrease in the carrying value of the
investment. The investment is reduced as cash dividends are received. NSTAR participates in several corporate joint ventures in which it has investments, principally its 145% equity investment in two companies that own and operate transmission
facilities to import electricity from the Hydro-Quebec System in Canada, and its equity investments ranging from 4% to 14% in three regional nuclear facilities, two of which are currently being decommissioned. The third plant site has been
decommissioned in accordance with the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission procedures.  11.Costs to Achieve CTA  CTA represent costs incurred to execute the merger that created NSTAR and includes the costs of a voluntary severance program, costs of financial advisors, legal costs,
and other transaction and systems integration costs. CTA was being amortized over 10 years at an annual rate of $111 million through the completion of the four-year rate freeze period based on the original rate plan and was estimated at $111
million, as approved by the MDTE. Effective upon completion of the rate freeze period on August25, 2003, the amortization expense was increased to reflect the actual CTA final expenditures incurred. As a result, the total CTA amortization
expense for 2005 and 2004 was approximately $164 million and reflect the final actual CTA of approximately $143 million.  12.Stock Option Plan  NSTARs 1997 Share Incentive Plan is a stock-based employee compensation plan and is described more fully in the accompanying Note J to Consolidated Financial
Statements. NSTAR applies the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for this plan.
Currently, no stock-based employee compensation expense for option grants is reflected in net income, as all options granted under this plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant. The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per common share if NSTAR had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation to stock-based employee
compensation. Refer to
