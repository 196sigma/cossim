Healthdyne Information Enterprises, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Healthdyne
Information Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and
1995, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders'
equity, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 and for
the period from June 15, 1994 date of incorporation to December 31, 1994.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the 1994 financial
statements of Healthcare Communications, Inc. 44% owned investee company
during 1994. The Company equity in earnings in Healthcare Communications,
Inc. was $154,000 for the period ended December 31, 1994. The 1994 financial
statements of Healthcare Communications, Inc. were audited by other auditors
whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates
to the amounts included for this company for 1994, is based solely on the
report of the other auditors.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of the other
auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Healthdyne Information
Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1996 and 1995 and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December
31, 1996 and 1995 and for the period from June 15, 1994 to December 31, 1994 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                              KPMG PEAT MARWICK LLP

100% of the losses of CHS through that date see note 11.
During 1995, Healthcare Communications, Inc. HCI made certain
convertible loans totaling $301 to Perceptive Systems, Inc. PSI,
a software distributor, thereby making HCI the beneficial owner of

b Basis of Financial Statement Presentation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. In
preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is
required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the
consolidated balance sheets and income and expenses for the periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.
c Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term investments
with original maturities of three months or less.
d Revenue
Revenue is derived from the sale of clinical information software
tools and products, and from providing related implementation,
support, training, and consulting services. Revenue from software
licensing and support fees is recognized in accordance with Statement
of Position 91-1, Software Revenue Recognition. Software revenue is
recognized upon shipment since i collectibility of the related
accounts receivable is typically probable, ii there are generally
no obligations remaining under the related software license agreement
after shipment, and iii customer acceptance is generally not
contractually required. All service revenue is recognized as the work
is performed or, in the case of a fixed fee contract, on the
percentage-of-completion basis, even though some services are
prepaid.                   F-8  41           HEALTHDYNE INFORMATION ENTERPRISES, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    e Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method
over an estimated useful life of five years. Amortization of
leasehold improvements is recorded over the shorter of the lives of
the related assets or the lease terms and is included in
depreciation expense.
f Excess of Cost Over Net Assets of Businesses Acquired
The excess of cost over net assets of businesses acquired goodwill
is being amortized using the straight-line method over 15 years.
Amortization expense related to acquired businesses amounted to $682
and $708 for 1996 and 1995, respectively, and $50 for the period
from June 15, 1994 to December 31, 1994. At each balance sheet date,
the Company assesses the recoverability of this intangible asset by
determining whether the amortization of the goodwill balance over
its remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future
operating cash flows of the acquired operation. The amount of
goodwill impairment, if any, is measured based on projected
discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate
reflecting the Company average cost of funds see note 3.
g Purchased Software
Purchased software includes the cost of purchased software tools and
products developed by a third party for the Company to exclusively
market and sell and the cost of software acquired in connection with
business combinations. It also includes the cost of licenses to use,
embed, and sell software tools and products developed by others.
These costs are being amortized ratably based on the projected
revenue associated with these purchased or licensed tools and
products or the straight-line method over five years, whichever
method results in a higher level of amortization. Amortization
expense related to purchased software amounted to $620 and $150 for
1996 and 1995, respectively, and $-0- for the period from June 15,
1994 to December 31, 1994.
h Research and Development and Capitalized Software Development Costs
Prior to the determination of technological feasibility for software
products and tools, research and development costs are expensed as
incurred. After determination of technological feasibility and
before the release of the software tools and products for general
availability, the development costs related to such tools and
products are capitalized. These costs are being amortized ratably
based on the projected revenue associated with these tools and
products or the straight-line method over five years, whichever
method results in a higher level of amortization. The Company
capitalized $789 of software development costs during 1996. There
were no capitalized software costs during any prior period.
Amortization expense related to capitalized software development
costs was $39 in 1996.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    i Income Taxes
Prior to the Spin-off, the Company and Integrated Healthcare
Solutions, Inc. results of operations were included in the
consolidated Federal income tax returns filed by Healthdyne. Under
the tax sharing agreement between the Company and Healthdyne, income
taxes were recorded by the Company as if it filed separate income
tax returns.
The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability
approach in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109 SFAS 109. Under SFAS 109, deferred income taxes
are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences
by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years
to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and
the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. Additionally, the
effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in
earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. Income tax
benefits are not recognized unless ultimate realization of such
benefits is reasonably certain.
j Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
of
The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 121, Accounting for
the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed of, on January 1, 1996. This statement requires that
long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash
flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are
considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets
exceed the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are
reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less
costs to sell. Adoption of this statement did not have a material
impact on the Company financial position, results of operations,
or liquidity.
k Stock Option Plans
Prior to January 1, 1996, the Company accounted for its stock option
plans in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles
Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations. As such, compensation
expense to be recognized over the related vesting period would
generally be determined on the date of grant only if the current
market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price. On
January 1, 1996, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS 123, which permits entities to recognize as expense over the
vesting period the fair value of all stock-based awards on the date
of grant. Alternatively, SFAS 123 also allows entities to continue to
apply the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and provide pro forma net
earnings loss and pro forma earnings loss per share disclosures
for employee stock option grants made in 1995 and future years as if
the fair-value-based method defined in SFAS 123 had been applied. The
Company has elected to continue to apply the provisions of APB
Opinion No. 25 and provide the pro forma disclosure requirements of
SFAS 123 see note 8.                   F-10  43           HEALTHDYNE INFORMATION ENTERPRISES, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    l Net Earnings Loss Per Share of Common Stock
Primary earnings loss per common share and common share equivalent
are based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding and
common share equivalents derived from dilutive stock options. Fully
diluted earnings per share are not significantly different from
primary earnings per share.
2  Related Party Transactions
Matria Healthcare, Inc. Matria, which was formed in a merger
involving Healthdyne in March 1996, provides certain legal, tax, data
processing, personnel and accounting services to the Company. Amounts
charged to the Company related to such services, which have been
reflected as general and administrative expenses in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31,
1996 and 1995 and for the period from June 15, 1994 to December 31, 1994
were $51, $325, and $164, respectively. Charges for services provided by
Matria to the Company are generally determined based on estimates of
actual time in providing such services to the Company using actual costs
without markup. To the extent that charges for such services and for
costs incurred by Matria on the Company behalf are allocations of
common expenses, such allocations are based on one or more criteria such
as asset or revenue size, relative transaction volume, employee
headcounts, facility size, and other relevant criteria. The Company
believes that such allocation methods result in reasonable approximations
of the common expenses related to the Company.
Prior to March 8, 1996, Matria also paid group health and property and
casualty insurance on the Company behalf. Amounts allocated to the
Company for these premiums and included in cost of revenue and operating
expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for
the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 and for the period from June
15, 1994 to December 31, 1994 were $10, $57, and $9, respectively.
3  Acquisitions
On October 27, 1994, the Company acquired a 44% interest in HCI of
Dallas, Texas for approximately $6,750 in cash. HCI is a provider of
integration engine software. The investment was accounted for using the
equity method of accounting and $154, representing HIE share of HCI
net earnings, is included in equity in earnings of affiliate in the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the period from
June 15, 1994 to December 31, 1994.                   F-11
44           HEALTHDYNE INFORMATION ENTERPRISES, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    On May 9, 1995, the Company purchased an additional 13% interest in HCI
for approximately $3,061 in cash bringing the Company total ownership
interest to 57%. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting with the results of operations of the business
acquired included retroactively from January 1, 1995. The acquisition
resulted in cost over net assets acquired of approximately $8,834.
Effective December 31, 1995, HIE increased its ownership interest in HCI
from 57% to 100% for approximately $6,162 in deferred payments financed
by two promissory notes. The first promissory note for approximately
$1,100 bore interest at 8% per annum, was secured by HCI accounts
receivable and was paid in full by the Company in April 1996. The second
promissory note is an approximately $5,062 convertible debenture,
bearing interest at 64% per annum, secured by a portion of HCI common
stock, and is due January 2, 1998. Principal and accrued interest
totaling $1,007 under this debenture were prepaid at a discount on
November 15, 1996. The remaining principal and accrued interest under
this debenture is convertible at the holders' option into shares of HIE
common stock at $350 per share on January 2, 1998 see note 6. The
acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
The acquisition resulted in purchased in-process research and
development of approximately $3,605, which was expensed in 1995,
purchased software of approximately $807, and additional cost over net
assets acquired of approximately $1,169.
On July 22, 1994, the Company acquired a 61% interest in DataView for
approximately $1,250 in cash. DataView produces a system that captures
and transmits radiology and other clinical images. The acquisition was
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting with the results of
operations of the business acquired included from the effective date of
acquisition. The pro forma effect on earnings for the period prior to the
acquisition is not significant. The acquisition resulted in cost over net
assets acquired goodwill of approximately $1,799, which was reduced at
the end of 1995 by $1,430 to reflect the impairment of such goodwill
resulting from a change in HIE strategic direction with respect to
DataView. Further, in connection with the acquisition, the Company
purchased an option for $300 to acquire the remaining 39% interest in
DataView. In conjunction with the goodwill impairment charge referred to
above, HIE also fully reserved the cost of this option at the end of
1995. On June 12, 1996, HIE and DataView entered into an agreement the
Agreement providing for a restructuring of the relationship between
the parties effective as of April 1, 1996. The Agreement provides, among
other things, for i a modification of the existing funding agreement
between the parties to limit the Company lending commitment to DataView
to a maximum of $2,042 the balance due under such funding agreement as
of March 31, 1996; ii the repayment by DataView of certain advances
totaling at least $93 made by HIE subsequent to December 31, 1995; iii
a reduction in HIE equity interest in DataView from the current 615%
to 195% through a stock repurchase by DataView financed by HIE under a
$1,061 fully reserved promissory note; iv certain rights for HIE to use
DataView clinical image management technology in HIE service business
as well as nonexclusive product distribution rights; and v a reduction
in HIE representation on the DataView Board of Directors and a
termination of HIE executive management responsibilities with respect
to DataView. Subsequent to March 31, 1996, DataView financial position,
results of operations, and cash flows are no longer consolidated with
HIE due to the immateriality of DataView current financial position
and results of operations.                   F-12

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 8  Shareholders' Equity
Capitalization
The Company was incorporated on June 15, 1994 and its articles of
incorporation authorized 20,000 shares of common stock and 10,000 shares
of preferred stock. The Company was initially capitalized on June 24,
1994, with the issuance of 8,000 shares of common stock to Healthdyne.
On December 12, 1994, the Company declared a 19375-for-one stock split
effected in the form of a stock dividend. Shareholders' equity and all
share and per share information in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements and related notes have been restated to reflect
this split. On August 10, 1995, the Company Board of Directors
approved an amendment to the Company articles of incorporation which
increased the number of authorized shares of common stock from 20,000 to
50,000 and increased the number of authorized shares of preferred stock
from 10,000 to 20,000. On November 6, 1995, Healthdyne distributed all
of the 16,115 then-outstanding shares of the Company common stock to
the Healthdyne shareholders.
Public Offering
On November 4, 1996, the Company sold 2,750 shares of its common
stock and received approximately $10,325, net of offering expenses of
$634.
Stock Option Plans
The Company maintains five stock option plans for the benefit of key
employees, nonemployee directors, and certain directors and employees of

have been authorized for issuance under these plans. Most of the stock
options granted under these plans are exercisable in equal amounts over
three years and expire in six years. Other terms of options granted
under the plans are determined by the Stock Option Committee of the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for its stock
option plans and, accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized
for its stock options in the financial statements. Had the Company
determined compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant date
for its stock options under SFAS 123, the Company net earnings loss
and related per share amounts would have been reduced increased to the
pro forma amounts indicated below                        1996     1995
Net earnings loss:

Pro forma                   02     66    Pro forma net earnings loss reflects only options granted in 1996 and
1995. Therefore, the full effect of calculating compensation cost for
stock options under SFAS 123 is not reflected in the pro forma net
earnings loss and related per share amounts presented above because
compensation cost is reflected over the vesting period of the options
and compensation cost for options granted prior to January 1, 1995 is
not considered.
There was no stock option activity for the period from June 15, 1994 to
December 31, 1994. A summary of stock option transactions under these

shares of the Company common stock reserved for issuance under this
plan, 14 were issued during 1996. Compensation cost related to this plan

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    Shareholder Rights Plan
On October 20, 1995, the Company Board of Directors declared a
dividend distribution of one purchase right for each share of the
Company common stock outstanding as of October 30, 1995. If a person
or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company
outstanding common stock or announces a tender offer or exchange that
would result in the acquisition of a beneficial ownership right of 20%
or more of the Company outstanding common stock, the rights detach
from the common stock and are distributed to shareholders as separate
securities. Each right entitles its holder to purchase one one-hundredth
of a share a unit of Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock, at a
purchase price of $50 per unit. The rights, which do not have voting
power, expire on October 23, 2005 unless previously distributed and may
be redeemed by the Company in whole at a price of $01 per right at any
time before and within 10 days after their distribution. If the Company
is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction, or
50% of its assets or earnings power are sold at any time after the
rights become exercisable, the rights entitle a holder to buy a number
of common shares of the acquiring company having a market value of twice
the exercise price of the right. If a person acquires 20% of the
Company common stock or if a 15% or larger holder merges with the
Company and the common stock is not changed or exchanged in such merger,
or engages in self-dealing transactions with the Company, each right not
owned by such holder becomes exercisable for the number of common shares
of the Company having a market value of twice the exercise price of the
right.
9  Employee Benefit Plans
The Company and HCI each maintain a 401k defined contribution plan for
the benefit of their employees. Prior to June 1, 1996, the Company
obligation for contributions under its 401k plan is limited to the
lesser of i one-half of each participant contribution but not more
than 25% of the participant base salary or ii 20% of the Company
pretax earnings before consideration of this contribution. Subsequent to
June 1, 1996, Company contributions are discretionary. The HCI plan
provides for HCI contributions equal to one-half of each participant
contributions up to 3% of the participant base salary. Contributions
to the plans included in the consolidated statements of operations for
the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 and for the period from June
15, 1994 to December 31, 1994 were approximately $79, $81, and $-0    respectively.

HIE had committed to make loans up to $4,000 to CHS with such loans
being convertible into a 64% ownership interest in CHS between October
21, 1996 and December 31, 2005. On December 4, 1995, Massey Burch
Capital Corp. Massey Burch agreed to invest in CHS by acquiring
one-half of HIE rights and obligations under HIE commitment. Under
this agreement, Massey Burch committed to make loans to CHS until the
later of December 31, 1996 or such time as Massey Burch had loaned
$1,300 to CHS. At that point, HIE and Massey Burch will make loans to
CHS until HIE and Massey Burch have each loaned a total of $2,000 to
CHS, each loan convertible into a 32% ownership interest in CHS between
October 21, 1996 and June 30, 2004. As of December 31, 1996 and 1995,
loans by HIE to CHS totaled $1,300. The loans bear interest at 8    payable annually, and are secured by CHS' accounts receivable, contract
rights, equipment, inventory and intellectual property rights, and a
pledge by the CHS shareholders of their shares of CHS common stock. The
losses of CHS are netted against the notes receivable from CHS in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are shown as losses of
affiliate in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.                    F-21

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    On December 18, 1996, the Company and Massey Burch entered into an
agreement whereby the Company acquired an option to acquire Massey
Burch investment in CHS. Prior to this agreement, the Company and
Massey Burch each held less than 1% of the common stock of CHS and an 8%
convertible debenture which is convertible into 32% of the CHS common
stock on a fully diluted basis. The option is exercisable at any time
during the period from December 31, 1996 through June 30, 1997, with the
option exercise price to be payable through the issuance of the greater
of 417 shares of the Company common stock or the equivalent number of
shares having a fair market value of $2,000 at the time the option is
exercised. As consideration for the grant of this option, the Company
issued to Massey Burch a warrant to purchase 50 shares of the Company
common stock at fair market value as of the date of grant. The agreement
granted registration rights to Massey Burch with respect to both the
shares of common stock underlying the warrant and the shares issuable
upon the Company exercise of the option. Massey Burch continued to be
subject to its commitment to fund CHS up to a maximum of $2,000. Massey
Burch has loaned $2,000 to CHS as of December 31, 1996.
On November 13, 1996, HIE and the two CHS executive officers entered
into an agreement in principle which contemplates the granting of an
option, at no cost to HIE: a to acquire the 26% equity ownership
interest in CHS held by the two CHS executive officers for 240,000
shares of HIE common stock and b to convert the 10% equity ownership
interest reserved for CHS stock options to a HIE tandem stock option
program. This proposed option, if exercised, must be exercised
simultaneously with HIE option to acquire from Massey Burch Capital
Corp. Massey Burch a promissory note convertible into 32% equity
ownership interest in CHS. The Massey Burch option is exercisable
between December 31, 1996 and June 30, 1997. The agreement in principle
further contemplates that the two CHS executive officers will
periodically vest through June 30, 1999 in an increasing ownership
interest percentage of the HIE shares issuable to them upon the
Company exercise of the proposed option. Finally, the agreement in
principle contemplates that the two CHS executive officers will be
granted certain registration rights with respect to those HIE shares.
The transaction contemplated by the agreement in principle is subject to
negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement and other customary
conditions. There can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will
be entered into or, even if entered into, that the transaction will be
consummated as described above or that the Company would exercise an
option to acquire Massey Burch interest in CHS.
During July 1994, HIE committed to make loans to DataView up to a
maximum of $2,450. As described in note 3, on June 12, 1996, HIE and

commitment to DataView to a maximum of $2,042 the balance due under
such funding agreement as of March 31, 1996.
