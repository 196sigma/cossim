KENSEY NASH CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2011, 2010 AND 2009  1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Description of the CompanyKensey Nash Corporation, incorporated in Delaware in 1984, is a medical device product development and
manufacturing company with a history of innovation and success in bringing new products to the market. The Company focuses on regenerative medicine by creating products and technologies that help the human body heal. The Company is recognized as a
leader for innovative product development, as well as for its broad portfolio of resorbable biomaterials products. The Company has an extensive range of products, which are sold through strategic partners in multiple large medical markets, including
cardiology, orthopaedic, sports medicine, spinal, cranio-maxillofacial CMF, trauma and general surgery. Kensey Nash Corporation was
incorporated in Delaware on August6, 1984. On January28, 2011, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and certain
operational liabilities of Nerites Corporation Nerites, and on May24, 2011, the Company acquired certain operational assets and certain liabilities relating to the business and product lines of Norian Corporation Norian. See Note 5 for
additional information on these acquisitions. The Companys acquisitions have added additional revenues and expenses to the Companys results of operations in comparison to its historical operating results and the results of these
acquisitions are included in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements beginning as of the respective acquisition date. 
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of PresentationThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Kensey Nash
Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries the Company. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The preparation
of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and the notes to the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and
assumptions, which may differ from actual results, will affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the reported amounts
of revenues, expenses and cash flows for the periods presented. Subsequent EventsThe Company has evaluated events and
transactions subsequent to the balance sheet date. Based on this evaluation, with the exception of the Companys August 2011 cash advance made to Orteq Ltd. Orteq Sports Medicine or Orteq, as disclosed in Note 8, the Company is not aware of
any events or transactions that occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date, but prior to the filing of this Form 10-K, which would require recognition or disclosure in its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents represent cash in banks and highly-liquid short-term investments that have an
original maturity of less than three months. These highly-liquid short-term investments are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in
interest rates. Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash
and cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt approximated fair value as of June30, 2011 and 2010. See Note 2 and Note 11 regarding the fair value determination of certain of these instruments. 
Business CombinationsIn accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC
Topic 805, Business Combinations ASC 805, the Company allocates the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based
62 Table of Contents
on their estimated fair values.Valuations are performed to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which requires management to make significant
estimates and assumptions, in particular with respect to intangible assets.Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable.These estimates are based in part on historical experience and
information obtained from management of the acquired companies and expectations of future cash flows. Transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with a business combination transaction are expensed as incurred. 
In-process research and development IPRD in a business combination is accounted for as an indefinite-lived asset on the balance sheet until the
associated research and development efforts are completed or abandoned. While classified as an indefinite-lived asset, acquired IPRD would be subject to impairment testing. The Company would determine the useful life of the intangible asset on
completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Alternatively, in an asset acquisition, the Company accounts for IPRD in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 730, Research and Development, whereby the costs
of intangible assets that are purchased from others for a particular research and development project that have no alternative future uses in other research and development projects or otherwise, and therefore no separate economic values, are
research and development costs at the time the costs are incurred and would be expensed and not capitalized as they do not have an alternative future use. Comprehensive IncomeThe Company accounts for comprehensive income under the disclosure provisions of FASB ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income. Accordingly, accumulated
other comprehensive loss/income is shown in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity at June30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, and is comprised of net unrealized gains and losses on the Companys available-for-sale securities, and
change in interest rate swap value. The net tax effects/benefit for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 of other comprehensive loss were $62,440, $218,826 and $658,775, respectively. Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment consist primarily of land, building, machinery, furniture and equipment and construction in progress and are recorded at
cost. Maintenance and repairs are typically expensed as incurred. Building, machinery, furniture and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their useful lives ranging from two to 30 years. Depreciation expense on property,
plant and equipment was $5,138,714, $5,212,039 and $5,367,713 for the fiscal years ended June30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In
fiscal 2011, in connection with the acquisition of the assets of Norian, the Company acquired a manufacturing and development facility in West Chester, Pennsylvania, consisting of approximately 37,000square feet. See Note 5 for additional
information. In fiscal 2010, a fire occurred which was contained to a small manufacturing area within the Companys corporate
headquarters building located in Exton, Pennsylvania. The Companys property insurance policy covered all remediation efforts and fixed asset replacements, subject to a $25,000 deductible. The Company recognized a gain of $775,000 within Cost
of products sold upon final settlement with the insurance carrier, as remediation and recovery efforts were completed. A total of $13 million was received in insurance proceeds for remediation efforts, replacement value of fixed assets and other
expenses. The Company replaced damaged fixed assets with a total value of approximately $480,000. The remaining insurance proceeds were used by the Company to pay for other related expenses and added to general Company funds. The total insurance
proceeds, including amounts relating to the outside remediation services and fixed assets, have been classified within the investing activities section of the fiscal 2010 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and the balance of the insurance
proceeds, used by the Company to pay for other related expenses, has been classified within the operating activities section of the fiscal 2010 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the identifiable net assets of THM Biomedical, Inc. THM, a company acquired in September 2000, and
MacroPore Biosurgery Business Unit MacroPore, acquired in May 2007. All of the acquisitions were accounted for under the provisions of ASC 
63 Table of Contents
805 and FASB ASC Topic 350, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other. The net carrying amount of goodwill at June30, 2011 was $4,366,273 and remained unchanged from the year ended
June30, 2010. The accounting standards provide that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but
are subject to impairment tests on an annual basis or at an interim date if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred. Intangible assets with definite useful lives will continue to be amortized over
their respective useful lives. The annual assessments as of June30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 indicated that goodwill was not impaired. 
Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows to be generated by the related asset are less than the carrying value of the asset, the Company measures the amount of the impairment by comparing the
carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. The estimation of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows. 
Accounts Receivable AllowanceThe Company had a trade receivable allowance balance of $5,867 at June30, 2011 and $13,513 at
June30, 2010 and 2009. Included in Selling, general and administrative expense for the fiscal years ended June30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were write offs totaling $7,646, $0 and $1,200, respectively. 
Revenue Recognition Sales Revenue The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC
Subtopic 605-10-S99, Revenue Recognition ASC 605-10-S99. Sales revenue is recognized when the products are shipped or the services are completed. Advance payments received for products or services are recorded as deferred revenue and
are recognized when the product is shipped or services are performed. The Company reduces sales revenue for estimated customer returns and other allowances. The Company recorded net sales return provisions, credits and discounts of $30,064 for both
the years ended June30, 2011 and 2010 and $33,000 for the year ended June30, 2009. In addition, the Company
accounts for customer arrangements containing multiple revenue elements in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 605-25, Multiple Element Arrangements ASC 605-25. The Company considers a variety of factors in determining the appropriate
method of accounting for its multiple elements agreements, including whether the various elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting. When the Companys multiple element arrangements are combined
into a single unit of accounting, revenues are deferred and recognized over the expected period of performance. The specific methodology for the recognition of revenue is determined on a case-by-case basis according to the facts and circumstances
applicable to each agreement. Up-front, non-refundable payments that do not have stand-alone value are recorded as deferred
revenue once received and recognized as revenues over the expected period of performance. The Company evaluates milestone
payments on an individual basis and recognizes revenue from non-refundable milestone payments when the earnings process is complete and the payment is reasonably assured. Non-refundable milestone payments related to arrangements under which the
Company has continuing performance obligations are recognized, using a contingency-adjusted performance model over the period of performance, where revenue is recognized for the milestone proportionately, to the extent of the performance period to
date and the remainder ratably spread over the remaining performance period of the arrangement. The Company also recognizes
grant revenue under research and development related U.S. government programs in the period that the related expenses are incurred.

Royalty Income 
The Company recognizes its royalty revenue at the end of each quarter, when the relevant net total end-user product sales dollars are
reported by customers to the Company for the quarter. Royalty payments are typically received within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter. Research and Development CostsResearch and development costs are charged to expense as they are incurred. Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of FASB ASC Subtopic 740, Income Taxes See Note 18. 
Earnings Per ShareEarnings per share EPS are calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share ASC
260. Basic and diluted EPS are computed using the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, with common equivalent shares from options and nonvested stock awards included in the diluted computation when their effect is dilutive
See Note 19. There were no nonvested stock awards included for the years ended June30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 that were antidilutive. Options to purchase shares of the Companys Common Stock that were outstanding for the years ended
June30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the options would have been antidilutive are shown in the table below: June30 2011 2010 2009 Number of options 1,441,867 1,180,611 978,193 
Option exercise price range 2345-$3571 2345-$3571 2555-$3571 
Share-Based CompensationThe Company accounts for its share-based compensation plans in accordance
with FASB ASC Topic 718, CompensationStock Expense ASC 718, whereby all share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense in the income
statement over the requisite service period. The Company generally recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards
granted over the relevant vesting period of the awards. Fair value for stock options and cash-settled stock appreciation rights SARs is determined using the Black-Scholes model, and the relevant expense is amortized over the applicable vesting
period for stock options and marked to market for the SARs See Note 14. Compensation expense related to share-based awards is classified on the Consolidated Statements of Income within the same line items as salary or consulting expense with
respect to the award recipients, and is recorded over the awards relevant vesting periods. Compensation expense related to share-based awards granted to the members of the Board of Directors is recorded as a component of Selling, general and
administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Derivative Instruments and Hedging ActivitiesThe Company
recognizes its only derivative as a cash flow hedge and measures this instrument at its fair value as either an asset or liability in the balance sheet, depending on the Companys rights or obligations under the derivative contract See Note
11. The change in the derivatives fair value is recorded each period in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. New Accounting Pronouncements ADOPTED: In October 2009, the FASB
issued ASU 2009-13, Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements of FASB ASC Topic 605, which amended ASC Subtopic 605-25, and was effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified
in fiscal years beginning on or after June15, 2010, which for the Company is its fiscal year ending June30, 2011 fiscal 2011. Alternatively, 
65 Table of Contents
adoption could have been made on a retrospective basis, and early application was permitted. This statement provides principles for allocation of consideration among its multiple-elements based
on an elements estimated selling price if vendor-specific VSOE or other third-party evidence TPE of value is not available. This statement allows more flexibility in identifying and accounting for separate deliverables under an
arrangement, introduces an estimated selling price method for valuing the elements of a bundled arrangement if VSOE or TPE of selling price is not available, and significantly expands related disclosure requirements. The Companys prospective
adoption of this new accounting update on July1, 2010 did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, the Company will continue to assess the impact of any
future arrangements entered into or materially modified after the Companys adoption. In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-17,
Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition of FASB ASC Topic 605, which was effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June15, 2010, which for the Company
is its fiscal 2011. This statement provides criteria for recognizing the achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved, only if the milestone meets all criteria considered substantive made at
the inception of the arrangement. The Companys prospective adoption of this new accounting update on July1, 2010 did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows; however, the Company will continue to assess the impact of any future arrangements entered into or materially modified after the Companys adoption. TO BE ADOPTED: In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2011-05,
Comprehensive Income Topic 220Presentation of Comprehensive Income, to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a
single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity. ASU 2011-05 will be
effective for the Company in its first quarter of fiscal 2013. The Companys pending adoption of ASU 2011-05 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, other than the
change to the required presentation format. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value
Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS Topic 820Fair Value Measurement ASU 2011-04, to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value
measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. ASU 2011-04 will be effective for the Company in its third quarter of fiscal 2012. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2011-04
on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No2010-29, Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma
Information for Business Combinations Topic 805Business Combinations ASU 2010-29, to improve consistency in how pro forma disclosures are calculated. Additionally, ASU 2010-29 enhances the disclosure requirements and requires
description of the nature and amount of any material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to a business combination. ASU 2010-29 will be effective for the Company in fiscal 2012 and should be applied prospectively to business
combinations entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2010, which is the Companys fiscal 2012. The Company will adopt ASU 2010-29 during fiscal 2012 and is not expected to have a material impact on its Consolidated
Financial Statements.  2.
INVESTMENTS Investments as of
June30, 2011 consist of non-taxable and taxable high quality municipal obligations. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 320, InvestmentsDebt and Equity Securities, the Company has classified
66 Table of Contents
its entire investment portfolio as available-for-sale securities with secondary or resale markets and, as such, its portfolio is reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included
in Comprehensive Income in stockholders equity and realized gains and losses included in Other income/expense in Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of June30, 2011, there were no investments with unrealized losses within the
Companys portfolio. The following is a summary of available-for-sale securities as of June30, 2011 and June30, 2010:  June30, 2011 Description

Total Investments 42,069,448 511,779 9,683 42,571,544 
As of June30, 2011, the Companys investments had maturities ranging from less than one year to approximately
two years. The Companys U.S. government securities, all of which had matured as of October 2010, were comprised of U.S. government agency debt instruments. The fair values of the Companys municipal obligations and U.S. government agency
debt instruments are obtained from broker quotes using pricing matrices based on inputs that may include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in the municipal and U.S. government bond market and based on other various inputs that are
directly or indirectly observable.  3.
INVENTORY Inventory is stated at the
lower of cost determined by the average cost method, which approximates first-in, first-out or market value. Inventory primarily includes the cost of material utilized in the processing of the Companys products and is as follows: June30 2011 2010 Raw materials 14,195,824 7,550,043 Work in process 2,150,144 1,425,174 Finished goods 2,057,054 2,018,512 
Gross inventory 18,403,022 10,993,729 Provision for inventory obsolescence 1,773,995 2,107,854 
Inventory 16,629,027 8,885,875 
Adjustments to inventory are made at the individual part level for estimated excess, obsolescence or impaired balances,
to reflect inventory at the lower of cost or market. Factors influencing these adjustments include: changes in demand, rapid technological changes, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical
deterioration and quality concerns. Revisions to these adjustments would be required if any of these factors differ from the Companys estimates. The June30, 2011 gross inventory balance includes the inventory acquired as a result of the Companys May 2011 acquisition of certain operational assets and certain liabilities relating to the
business of Norian See Note 5. The Company stepped-up the acquired inventory to its fair value as of the acquisition date, in accordance with ASC 805. The Companys purchase accounting adjustment of the fair value of inventory,
commonly 
67 Table of Contents
referred to as stepped-up value, of $1,286,016, represented the estimated capitalized manufacturing profit in acquired inventory as of the date of acquisition, of which the Company
has expensed $257,203 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. This non-recurring, non-cash charge to Cost of products sold will be recognized over the expected inventory turn-over period as the related inventory is sold, which approximates a 6
month period, as the capitalized manufacturing profit added to inventory under purchase accounting is expected to be sold within approximately the 6 months after the date of acquisition through the Companys second quarter of fiscal 2012.
The June30, 2010 inventory balances also reflect the Companys implemented cost reduction plan, which occurred in its second
quarter of fiscal 2010, primarily associated with its reduced endovascular activities and lower production volume, which included reduced work schedules. In connection with this plan, the Company incurred a $944,000 pre-tax unabsorbed overhead
expense charge in its second quarter of fiscal 2010.  4.
SELECT CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS These are
select customer agreements not otherwise discussed elsewhere in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. St. Jude Medical,
Inc. The License AgreementsUnder license agreements with St. Jude Medical, St.
Jude Medical has exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture and market the Angio-Seal Vascular Closure Device
the Angio-Seal, for which the Company receives an approximate 6% royalty on end-user product sales by St. Jude Medical. 
Prior Component Supply ContractUnder a supply agreement executed with St. Jude Medical in 2005, the Company was the
exclusive supplier of 100% of the collagen plug and at least 30% of the bioresorbable polymer anchor components for the Angio-Seal over the term of the agreement, which expired on December31, 2010. As part of that agreement, the Company
received a $10 million origination fee upon execution, as consideration for the Companys ongoing investments in collagen research and development. As of December31, 2010, the Company had recognized the full $10 million of this
origination fee. During the Companys first and second quarters of fiscal 2011, St. Jude Medical had purchased approximately $81 million of Angio-Seal components under this prior component supply contract. 
Current Collagen Supply AgreementOn June23, 2010, the Company entered into a new two-year supply agreement with
St. Jude Medical effective for the period from January1, 2011 to December31, 2012. Under this new supply agreement, the Company is the exclusive outside supplier of collagen plugs to St. Jude Medical. The new supply agreement provides
for contractual minimum order levels of collagen plugs for calendar years of 2011 and 2012. During the Companys third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2011, St. Jude Medical had fulfilled their calendar 2011 contractual minimum order levels under
this new supply agreement of approximately $4 million of collagen plug sales for the Company. As of June30, 2011, St. Jude Medical placed its calendar 2012 order for approximately $64 million of collagen plugs. This calendar 2012 order has
exceeded the contractually minimum level and provides for collagen plug sales to be recognized when the Company ships the product during the Companys second half of fiscal 2012 and first half of fiscal 2013. The new supply agreement does not
call for the Company to supply polymer anchors to St. Jude Medical. Orthovita, Inc. 
The Company has a development, manufacturing and supply agreement with Orthovita under which the Company develops and
commercializes products based on Orthovitas proprietary Vitoss Bone Graft Substitute Material in
combination with the Companys proprietary biomaterials the Orthovita Agreement. Under the Orthovita Agreement, the Company manufactures the products, while Orthovita markets and sells the products worldwide. Under the Orthovita Agreement,
the Company receives royalty payments on co-developed Vitoss, Vitoss Foam and Vitoss Bioactive Foam products based upon Orthovitas net total end-user sales of such products. 
68 Table of Contents
In a separate transaction in August 2004, the Company entered into an
agreement the Assignment Agreement whereby the Company acquired the intellectual property rights of a third party having rights in the Vitoss technology, an inventor of the
Vitoss technology the Inventor, for $2,600,000. Under the Assignment Agreement, the Company received all
intellectual property rights of the Inventor that had not previously been assigned to Orthovita. Also under the Assignment Agreement, the Company primarily receives a royalty on the sale of all Orthovita products containing the Vitoss technology, up to a total to be received of $4,035,782. The entire cost of these proprietary rights is expected to
be amortized over an approximate 83 month period. As of June30, 2011, the Company had recognized cumulative royalty income of $4,018,316 under the Assignment Agreement and $17,466 was yet to be received. The Company currently anticipates
receiving the remaining economic benefit in relation to these proprietary rights during the first quarter of fiscal 2012.  5.
ACQUISITIONS Asset Acquisition of
Nerites Corporation In January 2011, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and certain operational
liabilities of Nerites, a privately-held development stage company based in Wisconsin, for $19,741,761 plus acquisition-related costs of $326,673. Approximately $167 million of the purchase price was paid at the acquisition date, financed from the
Companys available cash and investments on hand. The remaining $30 million, of which $15 million is reported as each a component of Other current liabilities and Other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
June30, 2011, was held back by the Company under the terms of the acquisition as security for certain potential Nerites indemnification obligations and is expected to be financed with cash on hand. Of such $30 million hold-back amount, $15
million will be released on each of the first and second anniversaries of the acquisition date to Nerites, to the extent that the hold-back amount is not applied toward any such indemnification obligations. Nerites is a surgical adhesive based
biomaterials technology company founded in 2004 to design and develop products with a technology inspired by mussel adhesive proteins. The Company accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition based on an evaluation of the accounting guidance ASC Topic 805 and considering the early research stage of Nerites technology.
The Company concluded that the acquired net assets of Nerites did not constitute a business as defined under ASC 805 due to the incomplete nature of the inputs and the absence of processes from a market participant perspective. At the acquisition
date, Nerites had spent approximately $142 million on ongoing research initiatives targeted at developing three potential platform technologies that they had been researching prior to the acquisition: liquid adhesives/sealants, thin film adhesives
and anti-fouling/anti-bacterial coating capabilities. Nerites early research stage technology is based on a complex chemistry that produces an adhesive material that is novel and unproven and was previously unknown within the medical device
community. Nerites technology and intellectual property primarily focus on the chemical formulation involved in creating a molecule for an adhesive material. At the time of the acquisition, Nerites was still testing feasibility of the adhesive
technology and was primarily focused on identifying the mechanical or physical properties and reaction attributes of an adhesive raw material to serve as a starting point for a medical device. Substantial additional research and development will be
required to finalize a raw material formulation, and the unique processes specific to that formulation needs to be developed to enable the formulation to have the ability to be manufactured into a commercially viable medical device. There is risk
that a marketable material formulation may never be developed. Ultimately, the medical device would potentially need to complete clinical trials and receive regulatory approvals prior to any potential commercialization. 
In accounting for the transaction as an asset acquisition, the Company initially assigned the value of the consideration transferred plus
the acquisition related costs to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and operational liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. Additionally, the Company allocated value for the
identifiable intangible assets based on their relative fair values, which did not differ significantly from the fair values. The Company assessed the fair value of assets, including intangible assets such as IPRD, using a variety of methods,
including present-value 
69 Table of Contents
models. Each asset was initially measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant. Accounting for asset acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and
judgments to allocate the total cost of the acquisition to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including IPRD. Management is responsible for the valuation and considered a number of factors, including internal
and third party valuations and appraisals. The following is a summary of the allocation of the total cost of the acquisition:
Other receivables 8,519 Prepaid expenses and other 6,504 Machinery, furniture and equipment 93,230 Acquired other intangibles 1,813,182 Acquired in-process research and development 18,233,006 
Total assets acquired 20,154,441 
Accounts payable 50,579 Accrued expenses 16,146 Deferred revenue 19,282 
Total liabilities assumed 86,007 
Net assets acquired 20,068,434 
Of the approximate $18 million of Acquired other intangibles, $1,588,558 was assigned to know-how related
to Nerites adhesive technology with an estimated useful life of 25 years, based on the estimated remaining period of economic benefit of the technology, $159,868 was assigned to assembled workforce with an estimated useful life of two years,
and $64,756 was assigned to government grant applications with an estimated useful life of two years. Acquired IPRD in
the asset acquisition was accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 730, Research and Development ASC 730. At the date of acquisition, the Company determined that the development of the projects underway at Nerites had not yet
reached technological feasibility and that the research in process had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, the acquired IPRD was charged to expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income on the acquisition date. The acquired IPRD
charge is expected to be deductible over a 15-year period for income tax purposes. The $18,233,006 value assigned to the
acquired IPRD was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method MPEEM. The MPEEM is an attribution model under the income approach, which incorporates estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable
medical devices, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects, and discounting the estimated net cash flows to present value. The Company also considered other tangible and intangible assets required for successful exploitation of the
technology resulting from the acquired IPRD projects and adjusted estimated future cash flows for a charge reflecting the contribution to value of these assets. Such contributory tangible and intangible assets include working capital, fixed
assets, know-how, assembled workforce and government grant applications. The resulting estimated net cash flows from such projects were based on managements estimates of cost of products sold, operating cost and expenses, and income taxes
associated with such projects. The market rate of return was utilized based on market participant data to discount the net cash flows to present value. Due to the nature of the forecast and the risk associated with the projected growth and
profitability of the research projects, a discount rate of 365 percent was considered appropriate for the acquired IPRD. This discount rate was commensurate with the projects stage of development and, the risks relative to the
technologys feasibility and viability of commercial acceptance. As of the acquisition date, the Company planned to
develop a portfolio of hybrid adhesive-based products that integrate its extracellular matrix ECM, collagen and polymer technology platforms for applications in 
70 Table of Contents
general, neurologic, plastic/reconstructive, orthopaedic, urologic, cardiovascular and thoracic surgical specialties. Initial acquired IPRD product targets included devices for
1repairing defects in abdominal walls, 2meniscal tears, 3articular cartilage resurfacing, 4dural membranes, and 5gastrointestinal tracts. As of the date of acquisition, each of these five projects was expected
to utilize the adhesive technology and was 100% dependent on developing the adhesive raw material as described above. As of the date of acquisition, the Company expected to spend approximately $250 million over the next seven years to bring the
five projects under development to technological feasibility. As of the date of acquisition, assuming the research and development program to create the adhesive raw material is successful, the Company expected to begin receiving the estimated
revenues from the five in-process projects between fiscal 2013 and 2017, depending on the project. Determining the portion of
the total cost of the acquisition to allocate to acquired IPRD required the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions based on unobservable inputs, including, but not limited to, estimates of the timing of and expected costs to
complete the acquired IPRD projects; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the products; projections for marketing authorization and regulatory approvals; relevant market sizes, penetration and growth factors; current and expected trends
in technology and product life cycles; the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by the Company and its competitors; estimates of future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and
appropriate discount rates and probability rates. The Company believed that the foregoing estimates and assumptions used in the acquired IPRD analysis were reasonable based upon the Companys best estimate of likely outcomes of its
clinical development given available facts and circumstances at the time of the acquisition. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales, development costs or profitability, or the
events associated with such projects, will ultimately prove to have been appropriate. If the product development projects are not successful, the revenue and profitability of the Company may be adversely affected in future periods. Additionally, the
value of other acquired intangible assets may become impaired. Asset Acquisition of Norian 
On May24, 2011 date of acquisition, the Company completed its acquisition of certain operational assets and certain liabilities
relating to the business and product lines of Norian, a wholly owned subsidiary of Synthes, Inc. Synthes, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement and related Property Purchase Agreement, for a total purchase price of approximately $26 million $22
million pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement and $4 million pursuant to the Property Purchase Agreement. On the date of acquisition, the Company paid to Synthes the total cash consideration of $11,855,959 from the Companys available cash
on hand. The Company is required to pay the remaining $14 million on the earlier of the date on which the transfer of the manufacturing operation from the purchased West Chester, Pennsylvania facility to the Companys corporate headquarters
facility located in Exton, Pennsylvania has been completed or the 18-month anniversary of the date of acquisition. The $14 million deferred payment has been classified by the Company as a long-term liability. 
On May24, 2011, the Company also entered into a Supply Agreement with Synthes USA Sales, LLC, a subsidiary of Synthes, which
provides for the Company to be the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of the Norian product lines acquired by the Company under the Asset Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which Synthes will purchase all of its requirements for such products
exclusively from the Company, on the terms set forth in the Supply Agreement. The Supply Agreement, which was effective on the date of acquisition, has a term of 10 years and will automatically renew for successive two-year terms. Also, on
May24, 2011, the Company entered into a research and development agreement with Synthes to develop certain related future products. Norian was engaged in the development, manufacturing and marketing of bone repair cement, a proprietary cancellous bone replacement material designed for use in structurally compromised cancellous bone.
Additionally, Norian also manufactured and sold related delivery systems including mixers, delivery devices and needles. 
71 Table of Contents
The sale of Norian by Synthes is a result of the requirement for Synthes and Norian to
divest the Norian Business under the agreements which were entered into in October 2010 with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services OIG. The sale was
consummated to resolve the investigation related to the indictment against Synthes, Norian and four individuals who were executives of Synthes during the period in question, charging them with violations of the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in
connection with certain marketing and promotional practices involving Norian Corporation products during the period from May 2002 to July 2004, as filed by the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Under the
agreements, Synthes agreed to pay fines and also agreed to divest the Norian Business. In accordance with ASC 805, the Company
has accounted for the asset acquisition using the purchase method of accounting under U.S. GAAP. Under the purchase method of accounting, the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible acquired assets and assumed liabilities of
Norian, based on their respective estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The approximate $26 million
purchase price has been allocated based upon estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Independent valuation specialists conducted a valuation to assist management of the Company in determining the estimated fair values
of property, machinery and equipment and intangibles. The Companys management is responsible for these internal and third party valuations and appraisals. The work performed by the independent valuation specialists has been considered in
managements estimates of fair values reflected. The following summarizes the estimated allocation of the fair values of
the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date:  Cash paid for the Norian business 11,855,959 Long-term liability 14,000,000 
Total purchase price, net of assumed liabilities 25,855,959 
Accounts receivable 7,230 Inventory 7,511,396 Prepaid expenses 45,160 Land 910,010 Building 3,390,000 Machinery, furniture and equipment 1,483,700 Intangible asset customer relationship 13,790,000 Accrued expenses 196,431 Other current liabilities 136,789 Other non-current liabilities 68,394 Deferred tax liability 365,777 
Net assets acquired 26,370,105 Total purchase price 25,855,959 
Gain on bargain purchase of net assets acquired after deferred taxes 514,146 
Based on the purchase price allocation, the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeded
the fair value of the consideration paid, which was primarily a result of the fair values assigned to acquired building and land, as well as the additional stepped-up inventory fair value, which represents the estimated capitalized manufacturing
profit in acquired inventory. The Company recognized a gain on bargain purchase of net assets acquired after deferred taxes of $514,146 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, as a result of the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeding the
purchase price. The Company has reported $514,146 as the gain on bargain purchase after deferred taxes, which is included within Selling, general and administrative in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended June30, 2011.
72 Table of Contents
The Company has incurred through June30, 2011 a total of $506,000 of acquisition
related costs, including professional and legal fees, related to the acquisition, all of which were expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 805 and reported as a component of Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated
Statements of Income for the year ended June30, 2011. Under the purchase method of accounting, the Company assigned
$13,790,000 of the total purchase price to the intangible asset customer relationship, which will be amortized over the remaining period of economic benefit of 15 years and reported as a component of Selling, general and administrative expense.
The Company has reported the depreciation expense associated with the building, machinery, furniture and equipment as a component of Cost of products sold in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended June30, 2011. 
The Company acquired inventory of $7,511,396, which included the Companys purchase accounting adjustment of the fair value of
inventory, commonly referred to as stepped-up value, of $1,286,016, representing the estimated capitalized manufacturing profit in acquired inventory. The Company will record a non-recurring, non-cash charge to Cost of products sold that
will be recognized over the expected inventory turn-over period as the related inventory is sold, which will approximate a 6 month period after the date of acquisition through the Companys second quarter of fiscal 2012. The Company has
expensed $257,203 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, which is included within Cost of products sold in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended June30, 2011. 
On the date of acquisition, the Company did not assume any additional liabilities of Norian, other than the personnel related bonus and
vacation accruals for certain Norian employees. In connection with acquisition, pursuant to the Property Purchase Agreement,
the Company acquired a manufacturing and development facility in West Chester, Pennsylvania, consisting of approximately 37,000square feet. Additionally, the Company entered into a 10-year lease agreement with Synthes, under which the Company
will lease the entire building back to Synthes, which will in turn sublease a portion of the building to the Company for approximately 18 months, while the Company is in the process of transitioning the manufacturing of the Norian product from the
West Chester Facility to the Exton Facility. The results of operations associated with Norian have been consolidated with
those of the Company since the date of acquisition. Total revenues of $1,378,152 and net income of $84,768 attributable to the Norian product sales were recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011.
The following unaudited pro forma information sets forth the combined revenues and net income of the Company and the
historical unaudited Norian financial information for the fiscal years ended June30, 2011 and 2010, as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of each of the periods presented. Historically, Norian had not maintained certain distinct
and separate accounts from Synthes. Therefore, certain corporate overhead expenses, including but not limited to, human resources, legal, finance, tax and treasury functions, and other expenses such as intangible amortization, and related income
taxes, were not historically identified and accounted for in the separate historical unaudited financial records of Norian. In addition, the historical unaudited Norian financial information included in this pro forma includes total revenue of the
Norian product sales sold at arms-length to Synthes, who then was responsible for subsequently selling these products to the end-user market. The historical unaudited Norian financial information reflected the manufacturing and selling of the
product lines through inter-company arms-length transactions with Synthes at negotiated prices. Therefore, the unaudited pro forma information presented below is not necessarily indicative of that which would have been attained had the transaction
occurred at an earlier date, nor are these results necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations of the Company.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable and debt See Note 10. The Company manages its cash, cash equivalents and
investments based on established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities to maintain safety and liquidity. No single component of the Companys investment portfolio represented more than 10% or 11% of the total investments as of
June30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Companys trade receivables at June30, 2011 are primarily due from Synthes,
Orthovita and Arthrex and represented approximately 29%, 28% and 26%, respectively, of the Companys total trade. The Companys trade receivables at June30, 2010 were due from Synthes, Orthovita, Arthrex, as well as St. Jude Medical,
and represented approximately 1%, 13%, 29% and 40%, respectively, of the Companys total trade receivables at June30, 2010. The Companys royalty receivables are primarily due from St. Jude Medical and Orthovita, and represented
approximately 80% and 18%, respectively, of the Companys total royalty receivable balance at June30, 2011, and approximately 90% and 9%, respectively, of the Companys total royalty receivable balance at June30, 2010 See Note
4. If any of these customers receivable balances should be deemed uncollectible, it would have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial condition. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations on
all of its customers financial conditions, but does not require collateral to support customer receivables. See Note 15 for additional information regarding significant customer revenue disclosure. 7.
ACQUIRED PATENTS AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS The costs of internally developed patents are expensed when incurred due to the long development cycle for products and the Companys inability to measure the recoverability of these costs when
incurred. From time to time, the Company has acquired portfolios of patents and other intangibles that it believes are beneficial and complementary to the Companys existing intellectual property and material processing knowledge platform.
These acquisitions have included a portfolio of puncture closure patents acquired in November 1997, patents acquired in the asset purchase of THM Biomedical, Inc. THM in 2000, certain intellectual property and other rights related to the Vitoss product line acquired from a third party inventor in 2004 See Note 4, certain assets of MacroPore Biosurgery,
Inc. MacroPore acquired in 2007, as well as other smaller purchases. In fiscal 2011, the Company had acquired the following intangible
assets: On December21, 2010, in addition to making a non-controlling minority cost-method investment
in Orteq see Note 8, the Company entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Orteq and acquired the exclusive worldwide manufacturing rights of the Actifit Actifit product line for a period of ten years beginning with the date of its first U.S. commercial sale. The Company assigned $1,632,230 to the cost of the
manufacturing rights and related costs associated with the transaction. Actifit is a biocompatible synthetic meniscal scaffold which received its CE Mark approval in 2008 for the treatment of irreparable partial meniscal tears, and is currently
being sold throughout Europe. The acquired manufacturing rights are expected to be amortized over the period of economic benefit of approximately 13 years, and amortization is expected to begin in fiscal 2012, when the Company begins to manufacture
the Actifit product line. On January28, 2011, the Company acquired certain intangible assets of Nerites through an asset
acquisition transaction see Note 5. The Company assigned $1,813,182 of the total acquisition costs to the intangible assets, which will be amortized over the remaining period of economic benefit ranging from 2 to 25 years, depending on the
intangible asset. On May24, 2011, the Company acquired an intangible asset customer relationship of Norian through the
Norian asset acquisition transaction see Note 5. Under the purchase method of accounting, the Company assigned $13,790,000 of the total purchase price to the intangible asset customer relationship, which will be amortized over the remaining
period of economic benefit of 15 years. 
74 Table of Contents
The Company amortizes the entire cost of acquired patents and intangible assets over their respective
remaining periods of economic benefit, ranging from approximately 1 to 25 years as of June30, 2011. The gross carrying amount of such patents and intangible assets as of June30, 2011 was $25,912,611, with accumulated amortization of
$7,730,462. The gross carrying amount of such patents and intangible assets as of June30, 2010 was $8,677,200, with accumulated amortization of $6,628,605. Total amortization expense on these patents and intangible assets was $1,101,858, $967,279 and $1,122,937 for the fiscal years ended June30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The table below

COST METHOD INVESTMENT On
December21, 2010, the Company made a non-controlling minority cost-method investment recorded at the value of $2,452,665 in preferred shares of Orteq. The Company accounted for the investment in Orteq under the cost method. Orteq is a
privately-held medical device company headquartered in London, United Kingdom, specializing in the field of biodegradable polymer technology for meniscus repair. The Company has an approximate 8% ownership interest in Orteq and does not have the
ability to exercise significant influence over Orteqs financial and operating policies. The cost method investment was assessed for
impairment, and there were no indicators of any such impairment, as of June30, 2011. Subsequent to June30, 2011, on
August19, 2011, at the Companys option, and pursuant to an ancillary agreement, the Company made an additional investment in Orteq of approximately 637,000 British Pounds, or $1,055,063, in the form of a cash advance, structured as
convertible debt, to Orteq. As previously disclosed, under the investment agreement with Orteq, the Company had committed to making an additional minority cost-method investment of approximately 637,000 British Pounds, which was to be in preferred
shares of Orteq, payable in U.S. Dollars, if Orteq receives approval or conditional approval from the FDA to conduct an investigational device exemption for a product pivotal trial by the second anniversary of the Companys initial investment,
which is December21, 2012, or otherwise earlier, at the Companys option, prior to December21, 2012. Under the ancillary agreement, the Company has the option to convert its cash advance into preferred shares of Orteq as an
additional cost-method investment under the investment agreement, or if it does not convert its cash advance to shares, the cash advance and accrued interest will be payable by Orteq to the Company prior to August 2016. This additional cash
investment in Orteq did not impact the Companys ownership interest in Orteq. In the event the Company, pursuant to the ancillary agreement, agrees to convert its cash advance into preferred shares, the Companys ownership interest in
Orteq would continue to be less than 10%.  9.
ACCRUED EXPENSES As of June30,
2011 and 2010, accrued expenses consisted of the following:  June30,2011 June30,2010 Accrued payroll and related compensation 1,134,312 2,987,702 Other 1,115,801 879,578 Taxes Payable 1,627,630

75 Table of Contents
The Companys payroll accrual for its prior fiscal year ended June30, 2010, amongst other
compensation related items, included a cash bonus of approximately $19 million, which the Company paid during its fiscal 2011, as well as the remaining severance amount of $82,277, primarily resulting from a voluntary retirement program, which
occurred during the Companys second quarter ended December31, 2009 of fiscal 2010, in which the Company incurred a total severance charge of $1,011,058 that was included in the same line items as salary expense on the Consolidated
Statements of Income. As of June30, 2011, there was no accrual remaining related to the severance charge included in accrued payroll and related compensation.  10.
DEBT Secured Commercial
MortgageOn May25, 2006, the Company entered into an agreement for a $35 million Secured Commercial Mortgage the Mortgage with Citibank, F.S.B. The Mortgage is secured by the Companys facility and land in Exton,
Pennsylvania and bears interest at one-month LIBOR plus an 082% Loan Credit Spread. At June30, 2011, the outstanding Mortgage balance
was $30 million. The remaining principal payments due are detailed below:  Fiscal Year endingJune30 PrincipalPayments 2012 1,399,997 2013 1,400,000 2014 1,400,000 2015 1,400,000 2016 1,400,000 Thereafter 22,983,333
The Mortgage contains various conditions to borrowing, including affirmative, restrictive and financial maintenance
covenants. Certain of the more significant covenants require the Company to maintain a Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA as defined in the Mortgage to debt service equal to or greater than 150to10 and an interest rate
hedge of at least 50 percent of the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage through an interest rate protection product reasonably acceptable to Citibank, F.S.B. Interest Rate Swap AgreementIn order to hedge its interest rate risk under the Mortgage, the Company entered into a $35 million aggregate 10-year fixed interest rate swap
agreement the Swap with Citibank, N.A. in May 2006. The Swap is secured by the Companys facility and land in Exton, Pennsylvania. The Company is using the Swap as a cash flow hedge of the Companys interest payments under the Mortgage.
The Swap converts the variable LIBOR portion of the Mortgage payments to a fixed rate of 644% 562% fixed interest rate plus a 082% Loan Credit Spread. The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, to account for the Swap as a cash flow hedge due to the hedging of forecasted interest rate payments and to
record the Swap at its fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This value represents the estimated amount the Company would receive or pay to terminate the Swap. As such, the Company records a mark-to-market adjustment at the end of each
period. In establishing the fair value, the Company includes and evaluates dealer quotes, the counterpartys ability to settle the asset or liability and the counterpartys creditworthiness. Additionally, current interest rates,
collateralization of the Mortgage and the Swap by the land and building and any adverse Company or industry specific events that would impact the fair value measurement are considered. The Company utilizes the Hypothetical Derivative Method in determining hedge effectiveness each period. Transactions that would cause ineffectiveness would include the prepayment of the Mortgage or an
adverse Company or industry specific event that would impact the fair value measurement, which would result in the 
76 Table of Contents
Company reclassifying the ineffective portion into current earnings. If the conditions underlying the Swap or the hedge item do not change, the Swap will be considered to be highly effective. The
effective portion of the Swaps gain or loss, due to a change in the fair value, is reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss and has no impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income or Cash Flows. 
As of June30, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of the Swap was in an unrealized loss position of $4,919,658 $3,009,270, net of tax and $5,542,509
$3,602,631, net of tax, respectively, with the gross unrealized loss position included in Other non-current liabilities and the net of tax position included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest
expense under the Swap is recorded in earnings at the fixed rate set forth in the Swap. For the fiscal years ended June30, 2011, 2010
and 2009, no amounts were recognized in current earnings due to ineffectiveness or amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The Company does not anticipate any material unrealized losses to be recognized within the next 12 months
as the anticipated transactions under the Mortgage and Swap occur, unless the Mortgage or a portion thereof, is prepaid. The following table

Credit AgreementOn May26, 2011, the Company entered into a Loan and Agency
Agreement the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association Wells Fargo. The Credit Agreement provides for a three-year, unsecured revolving credit facility Revolving Credit Facility of $35,000,000, evidenced by a Revolving
Credit Note, dated May26, 2011, issued by the Company in favor of Wells Fargo. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company may
borrow up to the aggregate amount of the unused commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility may be used for the working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company, including permitted acquisitions and
capital expenditures. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will, at the Companys option, bear interest at a rate based upon
the London Inter Bank Offering Rate LIBOR of LIBOR as in effect for one, two, three or six-month periods, as elected by the Company, plus an applicable margin, or if no election is made, the one-month LIBOR plus an applicable margin. The Credit
Agreement will terminate on May25, 2014, unless the lenders elect to extend the Credit Agreement for up to two additional one-year periods upon the request of the Company, and which contains customary representations, covenants and events of
default. Certain of the more significant covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement require the Company to maintain ia maximum funded debt to EBITDA calculation of 30; iia minimum tangible net worth of $35 million; iiia
minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 15; and ivimpose restrictions on indebtedness and liens against the Companys assets. During fiscal 2011, and as of June30, 2011, there were no borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 820 for fair value measurement recognition and disclosure purposes for its financial assets and financial liabilities that are remeasured and reported
at fair value each reporting period. The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities and the Swap. The Companys assessment of the
significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. Categorization is based on a
three-tier valuation hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value, as follows:  Level 1Observable inputs such as quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  Level 2Inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, inputs that are quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and  Level 3Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.

The Companys money market funds are classified along with the Companys cash balances as Cash and cash equivalents within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Money market funds are valued at quoted prices in active markets. The Company follows the disclosure provisions of FASB ASC
Topic 825, Financial Instruments ASC 825, for disclosure purposes for financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value. As of June30, 2011, the financial assets and liabilities recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis include accounts receivable, net, accounts payable, deferred acquisition payments and debt obligations. The carrying value of accounts receivable, net, accounts
payable and current debt obligations, approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of long-term debt, where a quoted market price was not available, is evaluated based on, among other factors, interest
rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms, remaining payments and considerations of the Companys creditworthiness. The Company determined that the recorded book value of long-term debt approximates fair value at
June30, 2011 due to the variable LIBOR portion of the Mortgage payments.  12.
PREFERRED STOCK The Company has
authorized Preferred Stock consisting of 100,000 shares with a $001 par value, 25,000 of which are designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, as discussed below, and 75,000 of which are undesignated. The Board of Directors may
authorize the issuance of Preferred Stock, which ranks senior to 
79 Table of Contents
the Common Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets on liquidation. In addition, the Board of Directors is authorized to fix the limitations and restrictions,
if any, upon the payment of dividends on Common Stock to be effective while any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding. The Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, can issue Preferred Stock with voting and conversion rights, which could
adversely affect the voting power of the holders of Common Stock. At June30, 2011 and 2010, no shares of Preferred Stock were outstanding. The Company has no present intention to issue shares of Preferred Stock except that shares of Series A
Preferred Stock as defined below may be issued pursuant to a stockholders rights plan, as described below. Stockholders
Rights Plan On June19, 2009, the Company announced that its Board of Directors adopted a stockholders rights plan rights
plan that is designed to protect the Company and its stockholders from potentially coercive takeover practices or bids, and to prevent an acquiror from gaining control of the Company without offering a fair price to the stockholders. The Company
adopted the plan in order to give its Board of Directors time to evaluate and respond to any unsolicited potential takeover attempts. Under
the rights plan, the Company distributed, as a dividend, one preferred stock purchase right for each share of Common Stock held of record as of the close of business on June19, 2009. The rights plan has a term of 10years and will expire
on June19, 2019, unless the Company earlier redeems the rights or the Board of Directors terminates the rights plan. Each right, if and when it becomes exercisable, entitles a holder to buy one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock collectively, Preferred Shares for $20000, subject to certain conditions in the plan under which the exercise price may change. Pursuant to the Certificate of Designations of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock Series A Preferred Stock, there are 25,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock authorized for issuance. Each
share of Series A Preferred Stock will entitle the holder thereof to 1,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company, and the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common
Stock of the Company and any other capital stock of the Company having general voting rights will vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company. Holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock
will be entitled to receive, if declared by the Board of Directors, dividends payable when and as dividends are declared on the shares of Common Stock of the Company in an amount, subject to adjustment, equal to 1,000 times the aggregate per share
amount of all cash dividends, and 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, declared on the shares of the Companys Common Stock. At June30, 2011 and 2010, no shares of Series A Preferred
Stock were outstanding.  13.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION The Company
accounts for its share-based compensation plans in accordance with ASC 718. Compensation expense related to share-based awards is classified on the Consolidated Statements of Income within the same line items as salary or consulting expense with
respect to the award recipients, and is recorded over the awards relevant vesting periods. Compensation expense related to share-based awards granted to the members of the Board of Directors is recorded as a component of Selling, general and
administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The following table provides a summary of the Companys share-based

and Restated Kensey Nash Corporation Employee Incentive Compensation Plan, and prior versions of this incentive compensation plan the Employee Plan. In addition, the Company also has a Non-employee Directors Stock Option Plan the
Directors Plan, under which no shares are available for new awards and any awards of the type granted previously under the Directors Plan are now granted under the Employee Plan. The fair value of each option grant under the Employee
Plan was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table.  Granted During Year Ended June30 2011

Options are exercisable over a maximum term of ten years from the date of grant and typically vest over periods of zero
to four years from the grant date. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Companys Common Stock, and other factors. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the
valuation model; separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected terms of options are derived from historical exercise behavior and represent the periods of
time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended June30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, was $5,505,908, $787,511 and $5,052,764, respectively.

Nonvested Stock Awards Nonvested stock awards have been granted to the non-employee members of the Board of Directors, executive officers, certain other management of the Company and a non-employee outside consultant, pursuant
to the Employee Plan, and generally vest in three equal annual installments based solely on continued employment or service, as applicable, with the Company. Nonvested stock awards granted to executive officers, management, non-employee members of
the Board of Directors and non-employee consultants usually are referred to as restricted stock, but ASC 718 reserves that term for fully

Cash Settled Stock Appreciation Rights Cash-settled stock appreciation rights SARs awards were granted to eligible employees during the fiscal year ended June30, 2007, and provided each participant with the right to receive payment in
cash, upon exercise, for the appreciation in market value of a specified number of shares of the Companys Common Stock over the awards exercise price. No SARs awards were granted during the fiscal years ended June30, 2011, 2010 or
2009. The per-share exercise price of a SAR is equal to the closing market price of a share of the Companys Common Stock on the date of grant. 
83 Table of Contents
On November14, 2007, the Company offered to buy back the SARs from all current eligible employees,
excluding the executive officers, at the fair market value Buyout Price based on the closing price of the Companys Common Stock on December14, 2007. This offer resulted in the Company purchasing 173,940 SARs at a Buyout Price of $647
per SAR, for a total of $1,125,392 excluding the Companys portion of payroll taxes paid to the participating eligible employees, which represented approximately 99% participation by eligible employees of the SARs outstanding. 
As of June30, 2011 the average fair market value of each remaining SAR was $05 and the related liability for all remaining SARs was $4,784. These
SARs will continue to be remeasured at each reporting period until all awards are settled. No cash settled SARs were exercised or repurchased during the Companys fiscal years 2011 and 2010.

SARs are exercisable over a maximum term of five years from the date of grant and originally were to vest over a period
of three years from the grant date. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Companys Common Stock and other factors. The Company uses historical data to estimate SAR employee termination behavior within the valuation
model; separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the SAR is based on U.S. treasuries with constant
maturities in effect at the time of grant.  15.

A portion of the Companys deferred tax asset is offset by a valuation allowance relating to state net
operating loss NOL carryforwards due to restrictions imposed and uncertainty surrounding its use. The valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to an amount that represents managements best estimate of the amount of such deferred tax
assets that more than likely will be realized. At June30, 2011, the Company had state NOL carryforwards of approximately $619 million, which will expire through 2029, and no longer had a federal NOL carryforward. The Company has recorded a
valuation allowance against the states net operating losses with uncertainty surrounding its use of the $619 million. As a result of
the December 2010 Congressional approval of an extension of the Research Experimentation RE Tax Credit, the Company recorded retroactive adjustments to its tax provision during the quarter ended December31, 2010 of fiscal
2011. These adjustments reflect the fact that the legislation is retroactive to January1, 2010 and therefore, reduced the Companys effective tax rate in fiscal 2011. The Company recorded total RD Tax Credits of $442,574, $265,249
and $464,362, for the fiscal years ended June30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Uncertain Tax Positions 
The Company adopted the provisions of FASB ASC Subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes, on July1, 2007.The amount of unrecognized tax
benefits at June30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $103,694, $117,216 and $140,650, respectively. If these gross unrecognized tax benefits were recognized, $101,837, $115,359 and $139,183 would impact the Companys tax rate at June30,
2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company recorded interest and penalties of less than $2,000 for each of the fiscal years ended June30, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Interest and penalties are included in Interest expense and Other income loss
respectively on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Changes in the Companys uncertain tax positions for the years ended
June30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:  Fiscal Year Ended June30 2011 2010 2009 Balance at beginning of year 117,216 140,650 193,132 Increases related to current year tax positions 1,114 Increases related to prior year tax positions 26,787 21,866 64,907 Settlements/payments 71,121 Decreases related to prior year tax positions 2,098 Reduction due to lapse in statute of limitations 40,309 46,414 44,170 
Balance at end of year 103,694 117,216 140,650 
The Company and its subsidiaries file U.S. federal and various state income tax returns.The Company is no longer
subject to U.S. federal income tax examination for years prior to fiscal 2005 due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitation. The Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly in the next
12 months.

SALE OF ENDOVASCULAR BUSINESS On
May30, 2008, the Company completed the sale of its Endovascular business to Spectranetics. Pursuant to an Asset
Purchase Agreement, the Company sold to Spectranetics the assets related to the QuickCat QuickCat,
ThromCat ThromCat and Safe-Cross Safe-Cross product lines, including the stock of its European subsidiary Kensey Nash Europe GmbH, for a $100 million cash payment at closing, with an opportunity
for up to an additional $80 million in research and development milestone payments, a $60 million cumulative sales milestone payment and additional royalty payments based on future sales of the ThromCat and Safe-Cross products after the transition
of manufacturing of the products from the Company to Spectranetics. These payments and other related agreements are described below. On
May30, 2008, the Company and Spectranetics also entered into a Manufacturing and Licensing Agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to manufacture for Spectranetics the endovascular products acquired by Spectranetics under the Asset
Purchase Agreement and for which Spectranetics will purchase such products for the specified time periods. Spectranetics further agreed that, during the manufacturing period, it would pay transfer prices for the products based on the Companys
cost to manufacture such products plus a percentage of the end-user sales price of the ThromCat and Safe-Cross products. Additionally, Spectranetics agreed that, after the Companys manufacture of the ThromCat and Safe-Cross products was
transferred to Spectranetics, Spectranetics will be obligated to pay the Company a royalty on the end-user sales of such products. The
Companys second quarter ended December31, 2009 of its prior fiscal 2010 was the last quarter reflecting product sales of the QuickCat device, as the Company transferred its QuickCat manufacturing to Spectranetics as of December31,
2009. Spectranetics has no obligation to make royalty payments to the Company related to end-user sales of the QuickCat product. As
previously disclosed, Spectranetics publicly announced the discontinuation of sales of the Safe-Cross product line during the Companys second quarter of fiscal 2010. Spectranetics decision to discontinue the Safe-Cross product line
negatively impacts the Companys ability to receive future royalties based on sales of the Safe-Cross product, and at a minimum, delays the Companys achievement of the $6 million cumulative sales milestone, which is based upon sales of
the Safe-Cross, ThromCat and QuickCat products. This milestone is due to the Company when Spectranetics reaches a cumulative $20 million in end user sales of the product lines purchased by SPNC from the Company in May 2008. 
During fiscal 2011, the Companys manufacturing of the endovascular product line was limited to the ThromCat product. The Companys fourth
quarter of fiscal 2011 ended June30, 2011 is the last quarter reflecting its sales of the ThromCat product, as the ThromCat manufacturing was transferred to Spectranetics in May 2011, pursuant to the terms of the Manufacturing and Licensing
Agreement with Spectranetics. Following the transition of manufacturing of the ThromCat product to Spectranetics, Spectranetics will pay to the Company a predetermined royalty rate on the end-user sales of the ThromCat product. The amount of this
royalty will be based upon the timing and reason for the manufacturing transfer and, in certain cases, upon the amount of revenue generated by the ThromCat products during the applicable year. The royalty is subject to reduction depending upon the
scope of the patent protection obtained for the ThromCat product. On May30, 2008, the Company and Spectranetics also entered into a
Development and Regulatory Services Agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to conduct work to develop and obtain regulatory approval from the FDA for certain next-generation Safe-Cross and ThromCat products at the Companys expense on
behalf of Spectranetics. Spectranetics owns all intellectual property resulting from this development work. If clinical studies are required to obtain approval from the FDA for those next-generation products, the costs will be
91 Table of Contents
shared equally by the Company and Spectranetics; however, pursuant to an amendment to the Development and Regulatory Services Agreement the Companys contributions are limited to a maximum

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure
Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange
Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately and within the time frames specified in the SECs rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of fiscal 2011, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have not been any changes in
our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June30, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in the rules promulgated under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management has excluded from the scope of
its assessment of internal control over financial reporting the operations and related net assets it acquired from Norian Corporation on May24, 2011. At June30, 2011, the total assets and total net income of Norian Corporation that were
not subject to internal control over financial reporting represented less than 10% and 5%, respectively, of the Companys consolidated total assets and net income, respectively, at June30, 2011. Based on this evaluation, our management
has concluded that, as of June30, 2011, we did not have any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or
fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of
compliance with policies and procedures. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche LLP, has issued an
audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This audit report appears below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
Kensey Nash Corporation Exton, Pennsylvania
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Kensey Nash Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of
June30, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.As described in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures,
management has excluded from the scope of its assessment of internal control over financial reporting the operations and related net assets, which the Company acquired from Norian Corporation on May24, 2011 Norian. As of
June30, 2011, the total assets and total net income of Norian Corporation that were not subject to internal control over financial reporting represented less than 10% and 5%, respectively, of the Companys consolidated total assets and
net income, respectively, as of and for the year ended June30, 2011. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting of Norian. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are
subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June30, 2011 of the Company and our report dated September12, 2011
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.  s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
