ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
MILLENNIUM PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Millennium
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the
consolidated results of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

MILLENNIUM PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1999 1] BASIS OF PRESENTATION
THE COMPANY
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. incorporates large-scale genetics,
genomics, high throughput screening, and informatics in an integrated science
and technology platform. Millennium applies this technology platform primarily
in discovering and developing proprietary therapeutic and diagnostic human
healthcare products and services. The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Millennium
BioTherapeutics, Inc. MBio, and its 89%-owned subsidiary, Millennium
Predictive Medicine, Inc. MPMx. As more fully described in Note 3, in
December 1999, MBio was merged into the Company. As more fully described in
Note 4, the consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of
LeukoSite, Inc. subsequent to December 22, 1999. All intercompany transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 2] SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES
Cash equivalents consist principally of money market funds and corporate
bonds with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.
Cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 1999 and 1998 are
classified as available-for-sale.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents and marketable
securities. The Company cash equivalents and marketable securities are held by
high-credit-quality financial institutions. By policy, the Company limits the
credit exposure to any one financial institution. At December 31, 1999, the
Company had no significant concentrations of credit risk.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Equipment consists principally of assets held under capitalized leases and
is stated at the present value of future minimum lease obligations. Depreciation
is recorded over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the
lease using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost
and are amortized over the remaining life of the building lease.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets as of December 31, 1999 consist of goodwill and other
intangibles. Goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with
the 1999 acquisition of LeukoSite, Inc. See Note 4 are being amortized over a
period of four years. Goodwill recorded in connection with the 1997 acquisition
of ChemGenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is also being amortized over a period of
four years. Amortization expense for all intangible assets was $38 million 27 million, and $24 million in 1999                    50
MILLENNIUM PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1999 2] SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
1998 and 1997, respectively. Accumulated amortization for all intangible assets
was $89 million, $51 million and $24 million at December 31, 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively. On a periodic basis, the Company estimates the future
undiscounted cash flows of the businesses to which the intangible assets relate
in order to ensure that the carrying value of such intangible assets has not
been impaired.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue under strategic alliances as research
services are performed, reimbursable expenses are incurred, certain milestones
are achieved or license fees are earned.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, in accounting for
its stock-based compensation plans, rather than the alternative fair value
accounting method provided for under Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as this alternative requires the use
of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee
stock options. Under APB 25, when the exercise price of options granted under
these plans equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of
grant, no compensation expense is required.
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131
established standards for the way that public business enterprises report
information about operating segments in annual financial statements and interim
financial reports. SFAS No. 131 also established standards for related
disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major customers.
The adoption of SFAS No. 131 did not affect results of operations or financial
position. The Company has identified three operating segments which, under the
applicable provision of SFAS No. 131, have been aggregated into one reportable
segment. The Company conducts business exclusively in the United States.
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. The effective date of this statement was
deferred to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000 by SFAS 137 Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities--Deferral of the Effective
Date of SFAS 133. The Company believes the adoption of this new accounting
standard will not have a significant effect to its financial statements as the
Company investment policies prohibit the use of derivatives.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements
SAB 101 which provides guidance related to revenue recognition based on
interpretations and practices followed by the SEC. SAB 101 is effective the
first fiscal quarter of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1999 and
requires companies to report any changes in revenue recognition as a cumulative
change in accounting principle at the time of implementation in accordance with
APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes. The Company is currently in the
process of evaluating what impact, if any, SAB 101 will have on the financial
position or results of operations of the Company.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1999 2] SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
INCOME TAXES
The liability method is used to account for income taxes. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial
reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net
operating loss carryforwards, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and
laws that will be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets
may be reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated
with their ultimate realization.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts reported in the Company balance sheets for other
current assets and long-term debt approximate their fair value. The fair values
of the Company long-term debt are estimated using discounted cash flow
analyses based on the Company current incremental borrowing rates for similar
types of borrowing arrangements. 3] SUBSIDIARIES
MILLENNIUM BIOTHERAPEUTICS, INC.
In May 1997, the Company established Millennium BioTherapeutics, Inc.
MBio as a subsidiary and, pursuant to a Technology Transfer and License
Agreement, transferred and/or licensed certain technology to MBio in exchange
for 9,000,000 shares of the subsidiary Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.
At that time, MBio entered into a strategic alliance with Lilly for the
discovery and development of novel therapeutic proteins. Under the terms of a
related stock purchase agreement, Lilly purchased $20 million of Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock of MBio for an approximate 18% equity interest in
MBio. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
MBio since inception. The minority interest in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets reflects the equity interest of Lilly in MBio as of December 31,
1998 and the minority interest in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations includes the minority stockholder interest in the net loss of MBio
for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997.
In October 1999, Lilly was issued approximately 375,000 shares of Millennium
Common Stock in exchange for all shares of MBio Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock owned by it. Also in October 1999, MBio amended the terms of its strategic
alliance with Lilly. Under the amendment, the research program was refocused
from the discovery of new therapeutic proteins to further development of the
therapeutic proteins which had been identified in the course of the research
program. In December 1999, MBio was merged with and into the Company. Each share
of Class B Common Stock of MBio was converted into Millennium Common Stock.
The Company had entered into certain agreements with this subsidiary to
provide specific services and facilities at negotiated fees. Such fees amounted
to $105 million and $125 million in 1999 and 1998, respectively. The Company
had subleased approximately $06 million of equipment to MBio under an existing
capital lease agreement. All such intercompany transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.
MILLENNIUM PREDICTIVE MEDICINE, INC.
In September 1997, the Company established a wholly-owned subsidiary,
Millennium Predictive Medicine, Inc. MPMx, to develop products and services
to optimize the prevention, diagnosis                    52
MILLENNIUM PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

treatment and management of disease. In February 1999, MPMx announced the
formation of a strategic alliance in the diagnostic field with Becton, Dickinson
and Company Becton Dickinson. In March 1999, Becton Dickinson made an equity
investment in MPMx of $15 million, representing approximately an 11% voting
interest in MPMx, and paid a $30 million licensing fee to MPMx. The minority
interest in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets represents the equity
interest of Becton Dickinson in MPMx as of December 31, 1999 and the minority
interest in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations includes the
minority stockholder interest in the net profit of MPMx for the year ended
December 31, 1999. All intercompany transactions with this subsidiary have been
eliminated in consolidation. 4] LEUKOSITE MERGER
On December 22, 1999, the Company acquired LeukoSite, Inc. LeukoSite for
an aggregate purchase price of $5504 million primarily consisting of
6,676,933 shares of Common Stock and 884,087 shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise of LeukoSite options and warrants. The value of the common
stock issued in connection with this merger was calculated using a fair value of
$7452 per share. This per share fair value represents the average closing price
of the Company common stock on the date the merger was announced. Common stock
issuable upon exercise of LeukoSite options and warrants was assigned a fair
value using the Black-Scholes method. The transaction has been recorded as a
purchase for accounting purposes and the consolidated financial statements
include LeukoSite operating results from the date of the acquisition. The
purchase price has been allocated to the assets purchased and liabilities
assumed based upon their respective fair values, with the excess of the purchase
price over the estimated fair market value of net tangible assets allocated to
specific intangible assets and goodwill as follows

Amounts allocated to goodwill, assembled workforce, and core technology are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of four years. The 1999
amortization expense related to these items was $11 million. The Company
incurred a nonrecurring charge to operations of $3505 million for acquired
in-process research and development. The valuation of acquired in-process
research and development represents the estimated fair value related to
incomplete projects that, at the time of the acquisition, had no alternative
future use and for which technological feasibility had not been established.
The cost approach was used to value assembled workforce. This approach
establishes the fair value of an asset by calculating the recruiting and loss of
productivity costs avoided by obtaining a pre-existent, trained, and fully
efficient team. To calculate avoided recruiting costs, a unit cost for hiring an
employee equivalent to each of those transferred to the Company was calculated
and applied to each
53

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1999 4] LEUKOSITE MERGER CONTINUED
employee acquired. The avoided loss in productivity was calculated by
quantifying the time required for an employee to reach full productivity and
applying that amount to each employee total average cost.
The income approach was used to establish the fair values of core technology
and in-process research and development. This approach establishes the fair
value of an asset by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to the
asset over its useful life and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back
to a present value. The discounting process uses a rate of return commensurate
with the time value of money and investment risk factors. Accordingly, for the
purpose of establishing the fair value of core technology and in-process
research and development, revenues for each future period were estimated, along
with costs, expenses, taxes and other charges. Revenue estimates were based on
estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in
technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by
the Company and its competitors.
With respect to the value of purchased research and development, the Company
considered, among other factors, the research and development project stage of
completion, the complexity of the work completed to date, the costs already
incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of core technologies
and other acquired assets, the projected date to market and the estimated useful
life. The respective after-tax cash flows were then discounted back to present
value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The discount rates used in the
LeukoSite analysis ranged from 19% to 23 1/4%, depending upon the risk profile
of the asset.
The most significant purchased research and development projects that were
in-process at the date of the acquisition consisted of a chemotherapeutic agent,
a humanized monoclonal antibody for oncology and non-oncology indications, and
10 molecules in preclinical development. In aggregate these projects represent
approximately 83% of the in-process value. The chemotherapeutic agent represents
approximately 39% of the in-process research and development value. Key
assumptions used in the analysis of the chemotherapeutic agent included gross
margins of 95% and a discount rate of 22%. The chemotherapeutic agent is a new
class of small molecules that acts by inhibiting the proteasome, the complex of
a cell which regulates the breakdown of proteins that are critical for cell
proliferation. As of the date of the acquisition, the project was expected to be
completed and commercially available in the U.S. in 2006, with an estimated cost
to complete of approximately $15 to $20 million.
The humanized monoclonal antibody represents approximately 20% of the
in-process research and development value. Key assumptions used in the analysis
of this project included gross margins of 100%, as revenue is royalty based, and
a discount rate of 19%. The primary indication for this humanized monoclonal
antibody relates to the treatment of refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
The antibody works by binding to an antigen found on leukemia cells, thus
triggering their destruction. As of the date of the acquisition, the BLA for the
treatment of refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia was expected to be
completed by the end of 1999 and the product commercially available in the U.S.
in 2000. The clinical trials for the other indications for the humanized
monoclonal antibody are expected to be completed and products commercially
available in the U.S. between 2003 and 2004. As the BLA was near completion as
of the acquisition date and the clinical trials for the other indications build
substantially on work already performed, the estimated cost to complete these
projects is not considered significant.
The portfolio of molecules in preclinical development represents
approximately 24% of the in-process research and development value. As these
products are expected to be partnered, revenue will
54
MILLENNIUM PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1999 4] LEUKOSITE MERGER CONTINUED
be royalty based. Therefore, gross margins of 100% were used in the analysis.
The discount rate used in valuing the portfolio of preclinical molecules was
23 1/4%. Molecules in preclinical development relate primarily to treatments for
inflammatory and autoimmune conditions and diseases, as well as treatments for
asthma and allergies. Of the ten molecules in the preclinical portfolio, the
first molecules are expected to be completed and commercially available in the
U.S. in 2005 with the remaining molecules expected to be completed and
commercially available in the U.S. between 2006 and 2008. The estimated cost to
complete all projects in preclinical development is approximately $40 to
$45 million.
The major risk associated with the timely completion and commercialization
of these products is the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the
technology based on the data of long-term clinical trials. If these projects are
not successfully developed, future results of operations of the Company may be
adversely affected. Additionally, the value of the other intangible assets
acquired may become impaired.
The Company believes that the assumptions used to value the acquired
intangibles were reasonable at the time of the acquisition. No assurance can be
given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected
project revenues, development costs or profitability, or the events associated
with such projects, will transpire as estimated. For these reasons, among
others, actual results may vary from the projected results.
The following unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations have
been prepared as if the acquisition of LeukoSite had occurred as of January 1,

The Company has formed strategic alliances with major participants in
marketplaces where its discovery expertise and technology platform are
applicable. These agreements include alliances based on the transfer of the
Company technology platform, alliances which combine technology transfer with
a focus on a specific disease or therapeutic approach, and disease-focused
programs under which the Company conducts research funded by its partners. The
Company disease-based alliances and alliances which combine
technology-transfer with a disease focus are generally structured as research
55

collaborations. Under these arrangements, the Company performs research in a
specific disease area aimed at discoveries leading to novel pharmaceutical
small molecule products. These alliances generally provide research funding
over an initial period, with renewal provisions, which vary by agreement. Under
these agreements, the Company partners are required to make additional
payments upon the achievement of specific research and product development
milestones, and will pay royalties or in some cases profit-sharing payments to
the Company based upon any product sales resulting from the collaboration.
SIGNIFICANT ALLIANCES BEGINNING IN 1999
On February 22, 1999, MPMx and Becton, Dickinson and Company Becton
Dickinson formed a strategic alliance in the diagnostic field. The five-year,
genomics-based research collaboration focuses on several areas of oncology.
Under the alliance, MPMx has agreed to undertake a research program to identify
genetic markers and related assays that may be used to develop diagnostic
products for several types of cancer. Becton Dickinson has agreed to manufacture
and market any products that result from the research of MPMx, and MPMx will
receive a royalty based upon gross profits from any related product sales. On
March 31, 1999, Becton Dickinson made an equity investment in MPMx of
$150 million, representing approximately an 11% voting interest in MPMx, and
paid a $30 million licensing fee to MPMx. Becton Dickinson has agreed to pay
MPMx up to $515 million in research funding and additional annual license fees,
provided the alliance continues for the full five-year term. Becton Dickinson
has agreed to pay milestones and royalties to MPMx in connection with the
commercialization and sale of any products developed through the alliance.
Through its merger with LeukoSite, the Company became a party to a joint
venture agreement with ILEX Oncology, Inc. ILEX, to form L Partners, L.P.
L, for the purpose of developing and commercializing the
CAMPATH-Registered Trademark- monoclonal antibody product. In August 1999, L,
the joint venture, and Schering AG entered into a distribution and development
agreement which grants Schering AG exclusive marketing and distribution rights
to the CAMPATH-Registered Trademark- product in the U.S., Europe and the rest of
the world except Japan and East Asia, where L has retained rights. In the
United States, Berlex Laboratories, Inc., Schering U.S. affiliate, and L
will share in the profits from the sale of the CAMPATH-Registered Trademark-
product. On sales made in the rest of the territory, Schering AG has agreed to
pay royalties equivalent to the rate of profit sharing expected in the U.S.
Under the terms of the agreement, Schering has agreed to make payments of up to
$30 million for rights to the CAMPATH-Registered Trademark- product upon the
achievement of certain regulatory milestones. The joint venture currently
intends to use these funds to pay for ongoing development activity. In
December 1999, the Company and ILEX submitted a Biologics License Application
BLA to the United States Food and Drug Administration seeking marketing
approval of the CAMPATH-Registered Trademark- product. The Company accounts for
its investment in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting and
records its share of the income or loss in other income expense. The Company
is reimbursed by the joint venture for certain costs incurred on behalf of the
joint venture; these amounts have been recorded as revenue by the Company.
SIGNIFICANT ALLIANCES BEGINNING IN 1998
In September 1998, the Company entered into a strategic alliance with Bayer
AG Bayer. In November 1998, Bayer made an equity investment of
$966 million for approximately 496 million
56

shares of Millennium common stock. The primary goal of the alliance is for the
Company to supply 225 drug targets to Bayer over a period of five years. These
targets will be identified as relevant for cardiovascular disease, areas of
oncology not covered by Millennium alliance with Lilly, osteoporosis, pain,
liver fibrosis, hematology and viral infections. Future anticipated payments
over the full alliance term include $219 million of ongoing license and research
program funding, as well as a potential of up to $116 million of performance
payments for delivery of targets. Bayer has the right to cancel the agreement
after two and three years if certain minimum target delivery objectives are not
met. Millennium realized $825 million in revenues associated with license fees
and research program funding in 1999, and $334 million in revenues in the form
of an upfront payment in 1998.
SIGNIFICANT ALLIANCES BEGINNING IN 1997 AND EARLIER
In October 1997, the Company entered into a technology transfer alliance
through a collaborative agreement with Monsanto Company Monsanto. Under this
agreement, the Company granted to Monsanto exclusive rights to its technologies
in the field of plant agriculture, as well as a nonexclusive license to its
technologies outside the plant agriculture field. The Company has agreed to
collaborate exclusively with Monsanto in the application of those technologies
through the establishment of a subsidiary wholly owned by Monsanto. Monsanto
agreed to pay $118 million in licensing and technology transfer fees over the
five-year term of the agreement. Monsanto may also pay the Company up to
$100 million over five years, contingent upon the achievement of mutually
agreed-upon research objectives. Millennium may also receive royalty payments
from the sale of products, if any, originating from the research conducted by
the Monsanto subsidiary. Millennium realized $364 million and $382 million in
revenues associated with technology transfer and license fees, achievement of
mutually agreed-upon research objectives, and administrative services under the
agreement in 1999 and 1998, respectively, and $380 million in revenues in the
form of an up-front payment in 1997.
In July 1996, the Company entered into a strategic alliance with AHP to
discover and develop targets and assays to identify and develop small molecule
drugs and vaccines for treatment and prevention of disorders of the central
nervous system. In addition, this agreement provides for the license and
transfer of certain technology to AHP. If certain specified research objectives
are not met, AHP may terminate the agreement in September of 2000 or 2001. In
August 1999, the Company extended its collaboration in the area of central
nervous system disorders for at least an additional two years.

LEASE COMMITMENTS
The Company conducts the majority of its operations in leased facilities
with leased equipment. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, the Company
has capitalized leased equipment totaling $592 million and $464 million, with
related accumulated amortization of $292 million and $212 million.
Amortization expense related to capitalized leased equipment is included in
depreciation expense.
The Company leases its laboratory and office space under operating lease
agreements with various terms and renewal options, including major facilities
with lease expirations in 2003, 2013 and 2014. In addition to minimum lease
commitments, these lease agreements require the Company to pay its pro rata
share of property taxes and building operating expenses. At December 31, 1999,
the Company has pledged $31 million of marketable securities as security for
one letter of credit for the same amount with the purpose of securing one of the

Board of Directors.
COMMON STOCK WARRANTS
At December 31, 1999, the Company has outstanding exercisable warrants to
purchase 351,550 shares of Common Stock with a weighted-average exercise price
of $1439 per share, which expire through 2007.
STOCK OPTION PLANS
The 1993 Incentive Stock Plan the 1993 Plan allows for the granting of
incentive and nonstatutory options to purchase up to 5,400,000 shares of Common
Stock. Incentive options granted to employees generally vest over a four-year
period. Nonstatutory options granted to consultants and other nonemployees
generally vest over the period of service to the Company. In December 1995, the
Company amended the terms of outstanding option agreements to allow option
holders the right to immediately exercise outstanding options, with the
subsequent share issuances being subject to a repurchase option by the Company
under certain conditions according to the original option vesting schedule and
exercise price. At December 31, 1999, 19,881 shares issued under the 1993 Plan
are subject to the Company repurchase option.
The 1996 Equity Incentive Plan the 1996 Plan is substantially consistent
with the terms of the 1993 Plan and, as amended, provides for the granting of
options to purchase 5,600,000 shares of Common Stock.
The 1996 Director Option Plan the Director Plan provides that, upon
adoption, each then-eligible nonemployee director be granted a nonstatutory
option to purchase 20,000 shares of Common Stock. Thereafter, each new
nonemployee director will be granted a nonstatutory option to purchase 30,000
shares of Common Stock upon election to the Board of Directors. Upon completion
of the vesting of each option grant under the Director Plan, each nonemployee
director will be granted a new nonstatutory option to purchase 20,000 shares of
Common Stock. All options will be issued at the then fair market value of the
Common Stock, vest ratably over four years and expire ten years after date of
grant. A total of 250,000 shares of Common Stock have been reserved for issuance
under the Director Plan.
Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Stock Purchase Plan, eligible
employees may purchase Common Stock at a price per share equal to 85% of the
lower of the fair market value of the Common Stock at the beginning or end of
each offering period. Participation in the offering is limited to 10% of the
employee compensation or $25,000 in any calendar year. The first offering
period began on October 1, 1996. A total of 650,000 shares of Common Stock have
been reserved for issuance under the Purchase Plan as amended. At December 31,
1999, subscriptions were outstanding for an estimated 14,000 shares at $5668
per share.

to purchase up to 320,608 shares of common stock of MPI.
In December 1999, in connection with the merger of LeukoSite and the
Company, Millennium assumed the LeukoSite 1993 Stock Option Plan. As assumed,
the plan allows for the granting of incentive and nonstatutory options to
purchase up to 891,826 shares of Common Stock of Millennium
Options granted to employees generally vest over a four-year period. Options
granted to consultants and other nonemployees generally vest over the period of
service.
In 1994, the Company granted its chief executive officer an option to
purchase 533,364 shares of Common Stock for $030 per share. In connection with
the grant, the Company agreed to provide a loan of up to $267,000 at 7% per
annum upon option exercise. In November 1995, the officer exercised this option.
The Company made the loan and issued the Common Stock, subject to a repurchase
option that lapsed over four years. The loan and related interest, secured by a
pledge of the shares issued, were forgiven ratably over 48 months and has now
been forgiven in full.
During 1995 and 1996, the Company granted options to purchase 1,580,682
shares of Common Stock at exercise prices below the deemed fair value for
accounting purposes of the stock options at the date of grant. The Company
recorded an increase to additional paid-in capital and a corresponding charge to
deferred compensation in the amount of approximately $35 million to recognize
the aggregate difference between such deemed fair value and the exercise price.
The deferred compensation is being amortized over the option vesting period of
four years.
During 1999, MBio granted options to purchase 76,180 shares of MBio Common
Stock at exercise prices below the deemed fair value for accounting purposes of
the stock options at the date of the grant. These options were converted to
14,947 options to purchase common stock of Millennium in connection with the
merger of MBio and the Company. The Company recorded an increase to additional
paid-in capital and a corresponding charge to deferred compensation in the
amount of approximately $11 million to recognize the aggregate difference

The effects on 1997, 1998 and 1999 pro forma net income loss and net
income loss per share of expensing the estimated fair value of stock options
and common shares issued pursuant to the Stock Option and Stock Purchase Plans
are not necessarily representative of the effects on reported results of
operations for future years as the periods presented include only two, three and
four years, respectively, of option grants and share purchases under the
Company plans. 10] NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE
Basic net loss per share for 1999 and 1997 is computed using the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Net income per share for
1998 is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and
dilutive-equivalent shares from stock options and warrants using the treasury
stock method. At December 31, 1999 and 1997, diluted net loss per share is the
same as basic net loss per share, as the inclusion of outstanding common stock
options and warrants would be antidilutive. At December 31, 1998, the difference
between basic and diluted shares used in the computation of earnings per share
is 1,189,133 weighted-average common equivalent shares resulting from
outstanding common stock options and warrants. The 1999 net loss attributable to
common stockholders is calculated by including the deduction of a deemed
preferred stock dividend relating to

Income tax  $   --  $  --  $     At December 31, 1999, the Company has unused net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $178 million available to reduce federal taxable
income and $1423 million available to reduce state taxable income. The federal
net operating loss will expire beginning in 2004 and the state operating loss
will begin to expire in 2000. The Company also has federal and state research
tax credits of approximately $222 million available to offset federal and state
income taxes, both of which expire beginning 2005. Due to the degree of
uncertainty related to the ultimate use of the loss carryforwards and tax
credits, the Company has fully reserved these tax benefits. No income tax
payments were made in 1999 or 1998.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax

to the increase in research and development tax credits, net operating loss
carryforwards and the addition of various deferred tax assets related to the
LeukoSite merger offset by the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.
The valuation allowance increased by $78 million during 1998 due primarily to
the increase in research and development tax credits and net operating loss
carryforwards. The deferred tax assets acquired from LeukoSite and ChemGenics
are subject to review and possible adjustments by the Internal Revenue Service
and may be limited due to the change in ownership provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code.
