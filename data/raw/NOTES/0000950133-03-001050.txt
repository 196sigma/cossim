31 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors 
and the Stockholders of Eclipsys Corporation In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index on page 31 present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Eclipsys
Corporation and its subsidiaries at December31, 2001 and
December31, 2002, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
accompanying index on page31 presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read
in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. As discussed in note 2, the Company adopted statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No142 Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets as of January1, 2002. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Atlanta, Georgia

36 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.Organization and Description
of Business Eclipsys Corporation Eclipsys and its subsidiaries
collectively, the Company is a healthcare
information technology company. Eclipsys designs and offers a
comprehensive package of software applications and services that
together enable providers in a variety of healthcare settings to
improve the effectiveness of their operations. Eclipsys
advanced software solutions and services assist healthcare
organizations HCOs in improving their outcomes by augmenting
the quality of care and the level of patient satisfaction,
reducing costs and enhancing revenues. Eclipsys products
perform the core information technology functions required by
healthcare organizations and other healthcare providers
throughout the healthcare enterprise. Eclipsys services
offerings include consulting, outsourcing, remote hosting,
networking technologies and other related services. 2.Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The financial statements include the accounts of Eclipsys and
its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company manages its
business as one reporting segment. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities. The estimates and assumptions used in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements are based
upon managements evaluation of the relevant facts and
circumstances as of the date of the financial statements. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. The most significant
potential differences relate to the allowance for doubtful
accounts, revenues recognized under the percentage-of-completion
method, the amounts recorded for capitalized software
development costs and the valuation allowance for deferred tax
assets. Reclassifications Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform
to the 2002 presentation. See discussion of EITF Issue 01-14,
under New Accounting Pronouncements, herein. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, the
Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash
equivalents are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which
approximates market value. Revenue Recognition Revenues are derived from licensing of computer software,
software and hardware maintenance, remote hosting and
outsourcing, training, implementation assistance, consulting and
the sale of computer hardware. The Company recognizes revenue in
accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Statement of Position 97-2 Software Revenue
Recognition SOP 97-2 which requires, among
other matters, that there be a signed contract evidencing an
arrangement exists, delivery of the software has occurred, the
fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee is
probable.
37 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued 2.Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies Continued Systems and Services Revenue Multiple Element Arrangements The Company generally contracts under multiple element
arrangements, which include software license fees, hardware and
services including consulting, implementation and software
maintenance for periods of 3 to 7years. Under these
arrangements, where vendor specific objective evidence
VSOE exists for all undelivered elements, the
Company accounts for the delivered elements in accordance with
the residual method prescribed by the AICPA
Statement of Position SOP 98-9, Modification
of SOP97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect of
Certain Transactions. For arrangements in which VSOE does
not exist for each element, including specified upgrades,
revenue is deferred and not recognized until delivery of all of
the elements without VSOE has occurred. For software license
arrangements that are bundled with services and maintenance
where services are considered essential to the functionality of
the software and provide for payments upon the achievement of
implementation milestones, we recognize revenues using the
percentage-of-completion method. Under these arrangements,
software license fees and implementation fees are recognized
over the implementation period, which has typically ranged from
12 to 24months. In 2000, the Company began entering into long-term multiple
element arrangements in which it provides its customers with
comprehensive technology solutions. These arrangements typically
include multiple software products including the right to
future products within the suites purchased, implementation and
consulting services, maintenance, and, where desired by the
customer, outsourcing and remote hosting services. The customer
is entitled to these elements throughout the term of the
arrangements, which range from seven to ten years. Payments are
due yearly, quarterly or monthly over the arrangement term. The
Company bundles all fees due under these comprehensive multiple
element arrangements and recognizes the revenue ratably over the
contract term. Additionally, these contracts may contain
provisions by which the Company may earn additional fees based
on customer savings or other objectives, as defined in the
arrangements. These additional fees are recognized as revenues
upon receipt of payment from the customer. In addition, the
Company capitalizes related direct costs consisting of third
party software costs and direct software implementation costs.
These costs are amortized over the term of the arrangement.
During 2002, we began to enter into arrangements that consist of
fees for a multi-year, time-based software license, hardware and
services including implementation, consulting and software
maintenance. The Company recognizes the revenue under these
arrangements in accordance with SOP No97-2, including the
AICPA Software Revenue Recognition Task Force Technical Practice
Aid 510054. Revenue from other software license fees, which are bundled with
long-term maintenance agreements with terms from 3 to
7years, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
contracted maintenance period. Other software license fee
arrangements relate to certain add-on modules sold
to customers in the installed base. Because the Company does not
sell the add-on modules or the associated extended
term maintenance elements separately, the entire arrangement fee
is recognized as revenue over the contracted maintenance period
in accordance with paragraph 12 of SOP 97-2. Services Remote hosting and outsourcing services are marketed under
long-term arrangements generally over periods from 5 to
10years. Revenues from these arrangements are recognized
as the services are performed. Software maintenance fees are marketed under annual and
multi-year agreements and are recognized as revenue ratably over
the contracted maintenance term. The Companys software
maintenance arrangements include when and if available upgrades
and do not contain specific upgrade rights.
38 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued 2.Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies Continued Implementation revenues and other services, including training
and consulting are recognized as services are performed for time
and material arrangements and using the percentage of completion
method based on labor input measures for fixed fee arrangements.
The Company sells these services separately and accordingly has
sufficient vendor specific objective evidence of the element to
recognize revenue. Hardware Sales and Maintenance Revenue Hardware sales are generally recognized upon delivery of the
equipment to the customer. Hardware maintenance revenues are
billed and recognized monthly over the contracted maintenance
term. Unbilled Accounts Receivable and Deferred Revenue The timing of revenue recognition and contractual billing terms
under certain multiple element arrangements may not precisely
coincide, resulting in the recording of unbilled accounts
receivable or deferred revenue. Customer payments are due under
these arrangements in varying amounts upon the achievement of
certain contractual milestones throughout the implementation
periods, which generally range from 12 to 24months. The
current portion of unbilled accounts receivable is included in
accounts receivable in the accompanying financial statements. In addition, the Company maintains certain long-term contracts
used to finance a portion of certain customer hardware and
software fees owed. These arrangements generally provide for
payment terms that range from three to five years and carry
interest rates that range from 7% to 10%. Such amounts are
recorded as non-current unbilled accounts receivables until the
customers are billed which is generally on a monthly basis. The
non-current portion of amounts due related to these arrangements
was $18million and $15million as of
December31, 2001 and 2002, respectively, and is included
in other assets in the accompanying financial statements. The
current portion of amounts due related to these arrangements is
included in accounts receivable in the accompanying financial
statements. Accounts receivable was composed of the following as

development costs incurred subsequent to establishing
technological feasibility. These costs include salaries,
benefits, consulting and other directly related costs incurred
in connection with programming and testing software products.
Capitalization ceases when the products are generally released
for sale to customers. Management monitors the net realizable
value
39 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued 2.Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies Continued of all capitalized software development costs to ensure that the
investment will be recovered through margins from future sales.
Capitalized software development costs were approximately
$64million, $69million and $88million for
the years ended December31, 2000, 2001 and 2002,
respectively. These costs are amortized over the greater of the
ratio that current revenues bear to total and anticipated future
revenues for the applicable product or the straight-line method
over three years. Amortization of capitalized software
development costs, which is included in cost of systems and
services revenues, was approximately $29million 45million and $63million for the years ended
December31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. Accumulated
amortization of capitalized software development costs was
$141million and $204million as of
December31, 2001 and 2002, respectively. Acquired Technology and Intangible Assets Acquired technology and intangible assets are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The
carrying values of acquired technology and intangible assets are
reviewed if the facts and circumstances suggest that they may be
impaired and goodwill is reviewed at least annually. This review
indicates whether assets will be recoverable based on future
expected cash flows. The gross and net amounts for acquired

Amortization of the acquired technology and network services
assets is included in the cost of systems and services revenues. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued SFAS No142 Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets. Under this new standard, the FASB
eliminated amortization of goodwill and created indefinite life
intangible assets and established new impairment measurement
procedures for goodwill. In accordance with SFAS142,
goodwill is no longer amortized, but instead tested for
impairment at least once annually. There was no impairment of
goodwill upon adoption of SFAS142, and amortization ceased
as of January1, 2002, leaving a recorded balance of
$454,000 for goodwill as of December31, 2001 and 2002. The

Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of the Companys financial
instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, and other current liabilities, approximate fair
value. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the liability
method, and deferred income taxes are determined based on the
estimated future tax effects of differences between the
financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and
liabilities and tax carry-forwards given the provisions of the
enacted tax laws. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the
intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board
Opinion APB No25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations.
Under this method, compensation cost for stock options is
measured as the excess, if any, of the estimated market price of
the Companys stock at the date of the grant over the
amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. Accordingly,
the Company provides the additional disclosures required under

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2000,
2001 and 2002: dividend yield of 0% for all years, risk-free
interest rate of 575% for 2000, 427% for 2001 and 311% for
2002, expected life of 988, 681 and 743years based on
the plan and volatility of 113% for 2000, 78% for 2001 and 92%
for 2002, respectively. Basic and Diluted Net Loss Income Per Share For all periods presented, basic and diluted net
lossincome per common share is presented in accordance
with SFAS 128, Earnings per Share, which provides
for the accounting principles used in the calculation of
earnings per share. Basic net lossincome per common
share is based on the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income
per share reflects the potential dilution from assumed
conversion of all dilutive securities such as stock options and
warrants. Stock options to acquire 9,148,878, 8,006,072 and
9,020,711 shares of common stock at December31, 2000, 2001
and 2002, respectively, and warrants to acquire up to 5,160
shares of common stock at December31, 2000, 2001 and 2002,
were the only securities issued which would be included in the
diluted earnings per share calculation, if dilutive. In 2000 and
2002 the inclusion of stock options and warrants would have been

Concentration of Credit Risk The Companys customers operate primarily in the healthcare
industry. The Company sells its products and services under
contracts with varying terms. The accounts receivable amounts
are unsecured. Management believes the allowance for doubtful
accounts is sufficient to cover credit losses. The Company does
not believe that the loss of any one customer would have a
material effect on the financial position of the Company. Foreign Currency The financial position and results of operations of foreign
subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the respective
countries as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are
translated at the foreign exchange rate in effect at the balance
sheet date, while revenue and expenses for the year are
translated at the average exchange rate in effect during the
year. Translation gains and losses are not included in
determining net income or loss but are accumulated and reported
as a separate component of stockholders equity. The
Company has not entered into any hedging contracts during the
three-year period ended December31, 2002. Comprehensive Income Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No130, Reporting Comprehensive Income
requires that the total changes in equity resulting from
revenue, expenses, and gains and losses, including those that do
not affect the accumulated deficit, be reported. Accordingly,
those amounts, which are comprised solely of foreign currency
translation adjustments, are included in other comprehensive
income in the consolidated statement of changes in
stockholders equity. New Accounting Pronouncements In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets, which is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December15, 2001. This statement supercedes FASB
Statement No121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of. However, it retains the fundamental provisions of
SFAS121 for the
43 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued 2.Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies Continued recognition and measurement of the impairment of long-lived
assets to be held and used and the measurement of long-lived
assets to be disposed of by sale. Impairment of goodwill is not
included in the scope of SFAS144 and will be treated in
accordance with the accounting standards established in
SFAS142. According to SFAS144, long-lived assets are
measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost
to sell, whether reported in continuing or discontinued
operations. The statement applies to all long-lived assets,
including discontinued operations, and replaces the provisions
of APB Opinion No30, Reporting the Results of
Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions, for the disposal of segments of a business.
The adoption of SFAS144 has had no impact on the
Companys financial position or results of operations. In November 2001, the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue01-09,
Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
Customer or a Reseller of the Vendors Products,
which is a codification of EITF00-14, 00-22 and 00-25.
This issue presumes that consideration from a vendor to a
customer or reseller of the vendors products is a
reduction in the selling prices of the vendors product
and, therefore, should be characterized as a reduction of
revenue when recognized in the vendors income statement
and could lead to negative revenue under certain circumstances.
Revenue reduction is required unless the consideration related
to a separate identifiable benefit and the benefits fair
value can be established. The Company adopted EITF 01-09
effective January1, 2002, and it had no material impact on
the Companys financial position or results of operations. In January 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF
Issue01-14, Income Statement Characterization of
Reimbursements Received for Out-of-Pocket Expenses
Incurred. This consensus requires that reimbursements
received for out-of-pocket expenses incurred be characterized as
revenue in the income statement. The Company adopted EITF 01-14
effective January1, 2002 and has made the appropriate
reclassifications as required by EITF 01-14. The effect of
adopting EITF01-14 was to increase both revenues and
expenses by $4,780,000, $2,682,000 and $2,990,000 for 2000, 2001
and 2002, respectively. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No146,
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities. SFAS146 requires that a liability for a
cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be
recognized when the liability is incurred. It nullifies the
guidance in EITF Issue94-3, Liability Recognition
for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to
Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring. Under EITF94-3, an entity recognized
a liability for an exit cost on the date that the entity
committed itself to an exit plan. In SFAS146, the Board
acknowledges that an entitys commitment to a plan does
not, by itself, create a present obligation to other parties
that meets the definition of a liability. SFAS146 also
establishes that fair value is the objective for the initial
measurement of the liability. SFAS146 became effective for
exit or disposal activities that were initiated after
December31, 2002. The Company does not expect the adoption
of SFAS146 to have a significant impact on the
Companys financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB reached a consensus on EITF
Issue00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables the Issue. The
guidance in this Issue is effective for revenue arrangements
entered into fiscal years beginning after June15, 2003.
The Issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a
vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple
revenue-generating activities. Specifically, the Issue addresses
how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple
deliverables contains more than one earnings process and, if it
does, how to divide the arrangement into separate units of
accounting consistent with the identified earnings processes for
revenue recognition purposes. The Issue also addresses how
arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to
the separate units of accounting in the arrangement. We
currently follow the appropriate accounting pronouncement as
discussed in our Revenue Recognition policy note and anticipate
that the Issue will have no impact on the results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.
44 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued 2.Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies Continued In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 45,
Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others. This interpretation clarifies the requirements of
SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to
guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance
of certain types of guarantees. This interpretation is intended
to improve the comparability of financial reporting by requiring
identical accounting for guarantees issued with a separately
identified premium and guarantees issued without a separately
identified premium. The interpretations provisions for
initial recognition and measurement are required on a
prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are
effective for financial statements of both interim and annual
periods that ended after December15, 2002. We have adopted
the disclosure provisions of this interpretation and it did not
have a material impact on our financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows. We will adopt the remaining
provisions on January1, 2003 and believe that this
Interpretation will not have a material impact on our financial
position, results or operations, or cash flows. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS148,
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation-Transition and
Disclosure an Amendment to SFAS123.
SFAS148 provides two additional transition methods for
entities that adopt the preferable method of accounting for
stock based compensation. Further, the statement requires
disclosure of comparable information for all companies
regardless of whether, when, or how an entity adopts the
preferable, fair value based method of accounting. These
disclosures are now required for interim periods in addition to
the traditional annual disclosure. The amendments to
SFAS123, which provides for additional methods, are
effective for periods beginning after December15, 2002,
although earlier application is permitted. The amendments to the
disclosure requirements are required for financial reports
containing condensed financial statements for interim periods
beginning after December15, 2002. We anticipate that we
will adopt the additional disclosure requirements in our interim
and annual filings of SFAS148 and will continue to account
for stock based compensation under APB No25. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. This
interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin 51,
Consolidated Financial Statements, addresses
consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest
entities that possess certain characteristics. The
interpretation requires that if a business enterprise has a
controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity,
the assets, liabilities, and results of the activities of the
variable interest entity must be included in the consolidated
financial statements with those of the business enterprise. This
interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities
created after January31, 2003 and to variable interest
entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that
date. We do not have any ownership in any variable interest
entities as of December31, 2002. We will apply the
consolidation requirement of the interpretation in future
periods if we should own any interest in any variable interest
entity. 3.Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and
amortization are provided for using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives, which generally range from two
to seven years. Computer equipment is depreciated over two to
five years. Office equipment is depreciated over two to seven
years. Purchased software for internal use is amortized over
three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
shorter of the useful lives of the assets or the remaining term
of the lease. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of,
the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from
the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in
income. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance not considered

as its Chief Executive Officer and President. Under his
employment arrangement with the Company, Mr.Ruflin
received a restricted stock grant effective July15, 2002
of 150,000 shares of the Companys common stock subject to
a five-year vesting schedule, plus an option to purchase 850,000
shares of the Companys common stock at a price of $750,
with vesting over a five-year period. During 2002, stock
compensation related to this restricted stock grant amounted to
$103,000 and as of December31, 2002, the Company had
unearned stock compensation of $1,021,000 recorded in
stockholders equity. Undesignated Preferred Stock The Company has available for issuance, 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock. As discussed below under Shareholder
Rights Plan the Board has designated 100,000 of the
5,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock as SeriesA
Junior Participating Preferred Stock. The Company has a balance
of 4,900,000 authorized shares of undesignated preferred stock
the Undesignated Preferred. The liquidation,
voting, conversion and other related provisions of the
Undesignated Preferred will be determined by the Board of
Directors at the time of issuance. Currently, there are no
outstanding shares. Shareholder Rights Plan On July26, 2000, the Board of Directors of the Company
declared a dividend of one Right for each outstanding share of
the Companys Common Stock to stockholders of record at the
close of business on August9, 2000. Each Right entitles
the registered holder to purchase from the Company one
one-thousandth of a share of SeriesA Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, $01 par value per share, at a Purchase Price
of $6500 in cash, subject to adjustment. The Rights will
initially trade together with the Eclipsys Common Stock and will
not be exercisable. If a person or group other than an exempt
person acquires 15% or more of the outstanding shares of
Eclipsys Common Stock, the Rights generally will become
exercisable and allow the holder other than the 15% purchaser
to purchase shares of Eclipsys Common Stock at a 50% discount to
the market price. The effect will be to discourage acquisitions
of 15% or more of Eclipsys Common Stock without negotiations
with the Board. The terms of the Rights are set forth in a
Rights Agreement dated as of July26, 2000 the
Rights Agreement between the Company and Fleet
National Bank, as Rights Agent. The Board

public offering for 5,750,000 shares of its common stock. Net
proceeds from the offering were approximately
$1232million. 5.Proposed Merger During the quarter ended March31, 2000, the Company

Corp. SMS of approximately $45million. The
investment was made in connection with a proposed merger with
SMS that was not consummated. In connection with the proposed
merger, the Company recorded transaction costs of approximately
$50,000. On March30, 2000, the Company entered into a definitive
merger agreement to merge with Neoforma.com, Inc.
Neoforma of Santa Clara, California. Neoforma is a
provider of business-to-business e-commerce services in the
medical products, supplies and equipment industry. During the
quarter ended June30, 2000, the Company and Neoforma
agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement between them without
the payment of a termination fee. Transaction costs incurred in
connection with the proposed merger were approximately

At December31, 2002, the Company had net operating loss
carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately
$1532million. The carryforwards expire in varying amounts
through 2022. Of this amount, $404million relate to stock
option tax deductions, which will be tax-effected and the
benefit credited as additional paid-in-capital when realized.
Additionally, the Company has Canadian net operating loss
carryovers of approximately $59 million that expire in varying
amounts through 2009. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of, and the
benefits from, net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired
or limited in certain circumstances. The Company experienced an
ownership change as defined under Section382 of the
Internal Revenue Code in November 1998. As a result of the
ownership change, net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $16million at November 1998, which were
incurred prior to the date of the change, are subject to annual
limitations on their future use. As of December31, 2002, a
valuation allowance has been established against the deferred
tax assets that management does not believe are more likely than
not to be realized.

Subsequent to December31, 2002 the Company contracted for
a minimum number of hours for airplane charters with a related
note 9. The minimum commitment amounts to $761,000 per year
for 2003 through 2005. Litigation From July through September 2002, the Company and three of its
officers Messrs.Colletti, Patton and Wilson were named
in seven complaints filed by purported shareholders of the
Company in the United States District Court, Southern District
of Florida, West Palm Beach Division the District
Court. Each complaint seeks certification as a class and
monetary damages and alleges that the Company and the named
officers violated federal securities laws. The Company believes
that the actions are without merit, and intends to conduct a
vigorous defense against these allegations. In September 2002, various parties filed motions to be appointed
as lead plaintiffs and to consolidate all of the shareholder
suits described above. On February4, 2003, the District
Court issued an order consolidating all seven cases into one
single case and appointing the City of Philadelphia Board of
Pensions and Retirement, Louis Giannakokas and Norman K.
Mielziner to serve as lead plaintiffs the Consolidation
Order. The Consolidation Order also sets certain
timelines by which responsive pleadings must be filed by the
Company and the lead plaintiffs in the consolidated case. Under
the Consolidation Order, the lead plaintiffs have until
March31, 2003 to file an amended, consolidated complaint;
however, it is our understanding that the plaintiffs are in the
process of requesting an extension to this deadline. Once the
amended, consolidated complaint is filed, the Company shall have
sixty 60days from such date to answer or move to dismiss
the amended complaint. The Company is involved in other litigation incidental to its
business from time to time. In the opinion of management, after
consultation with legal counsel, the ultimate outcome of such
litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the
Companys financial position or results of operations or
cash flows. 9.Related Party Transactions Eclipsys has a policy that all transactions between it and its
executive officers, directors and affiliates must be on terms no
less favorable to the Company than could be obtained from
unaffiliated third parties. Additionally, these transactions
must be approved by a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors and by a majority of the disinterested members of the
