37  1SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  aNature of Business  United Natural Foods,Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company is a distributor and retailer of natural and organic products. The Company sells its products
throughout the United States.  bBasis of Consolidation  The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  cCash Equivalents  Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investment instruments with original maturities of three months or less.  dInventories and Cost of Sales  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method. Allowances
received from suppliers are recorded as reductions in cost of sales upon the sale of the related products.  eProperty and Equipment  Property and equipment are stated at cost. Equipment under capital leases is stated at the present value of minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease.
Depreciation and amortization are principally provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.  fIncome Taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  gIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets  Intangible assets consist principally of goodwill and covenants not to compete. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over fair value of net assets
acquired in connection with purchase business combinations. Covenants not to compete are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized using the straight-line method over the lives of
the respective agreements, generally five years. 
Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets requires that companies no
longer amortize goodwill, but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair
value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company has elected to perform its annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment as of July31 of each year. Impairment losses are
determined based upon the excess of carrying amounts over discounted expected future cash flows of the underlying business. The assessment of the recoverability of long-lived assets 
38  will
be impacted if estimated future cash flows are not achieved. For reporting units that indicated potential impairment, we determined the implied fair value of that reporting unit using a
discounted cash flow analysis and compared such values to the respective reporting units' carrying amounts. 
The
restructuring of Hershey during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 represented a triggering event that required the Company to evaluate Hershey goodwill for potential impairment.
The Company testing and subsequent analysis indicated that goodwill for Hershey was impaired. Accordingly, the Company recognized an impairment charge of approximately $14million on
goodwill for the year ended July31, 2003. As of July31, 2002, the Company annual assessment of each of its reporting units indicated that no impairment of goodwill existed. 
The
Company recorded additional goodwill in our Distribution operating segment of approximately $274million during the year ended July31, 2003 as a result of our
acquisitions of Blooming Prairie Cooperative Warehouse $138million and Northeast Cooperative $136million. Total goodwill as of July31, 2003 was $574million after
recording the Hershey impairment charge of approximately $14million. As of July31, 2002, the Company had goodwill of $314million. Goodwill for the Distribution operating
segment totaled $457million and $184million as of July31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Other
intangibles consist of covenants not to compete and a supply agreement with a weighted average amortization period of three years and three months. The Company had other
intangibles less related accumulated amortization of $15million and $05million at July31, 2003, respectively, and $05million and $02million at
July31, 2002, respectively. Amortization expense was $04million, $01million and $01million for the years ended July31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Estimated amortization expense for the next five fiscal years is as follows: Years ended July31 
in thousands 2004 472 2005 393 2006 116 2007 30 2008 3 1,014 hRevenue Recognition and Concentration of Credit Risk  The Company records revenue upon shipment of products. Revenues are recorded net of applicable sales discounts and estimated sales returns. Sales incentives
provided to customers are accounted for as reductions in revenue as the related revenue is recorded. The Company sales are with customers located throughout the United States. The Company had one
customer in 2003, Whole Foods Market,Inc. Whole Foods, which provided more than 10% of the Company revenue. In 2002 and 2001, two customers, Whole Foods and Wild Oats,Inc. Wild
Oats, generated 10% or more of the Company revenues. Total net sales to Whole Foods were approximately $3309million, $2246million and $1690million in 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. Wild Oats total net sales in 2002 and 2001 were approximately $1628 and $1470million, respectively. On June19, 2002, the Company announced that its contract as
primary distributor to Wild Oats would not be renewed past its expiration date of August31, 2002. However, the Company continued to distribute to Wild Oats in fiscal 2003 as a secondary
supplier generating revenue from such distribution of approximately $30million. The
Company analyzes customer creditworthiness, accounts receivable balances, payment history, payment terms and historical bad debt levels when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance
for 
39  doubtful
accounts. In instances where a reserve has been recorded for a particular customer, future sales to the customer are conducted using either cash-on-delivery terms, or
the account is closely monitored so that as agreed upon payments are received, orders are released; a failure to pay results in held or cancelled orders.  iAdvertising  Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $66million, $52million and $54million for the years ended
July31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  jFair Value of Financial Instruments  The carrying amounts of the Company financial instruments including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due
to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of notes receivable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations are based on the instruments' interest rate,
terms, maturity date and collateral, if any, in comparison to the Company incremental borrowing rate for similar financial instruments. 
The
following estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment
is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize
in a current market exchange. July31, 2003

assets and liabilities to prepare these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.  lNotes Receivable, Trade  The Company issues notes receivable, trade to certain customers under two basic circumstances; inventory purchases for initial store openings and overdue accounts
receivable. Initial store opening notes are generally receivable over a period not to exceed twelve months. The overdue accounts receivable notes may extend for periods greater than one year. All
notes are issued at a market interest rate and contain certain guarantees and collateral assignments in favor of the Company. 
40  mStock-Based Compensation  The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees and certain other individuals with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the
shares at the dates of grant. The Company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-based
Compensation SFAS123, and will continue to account for its stock option plans in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. In addition, the Company has made the appropriate disclosures as required under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean amendment of FASB Statement
No123.

following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provision of SFAS123 and SFAS148 to

share are calculated by adding the dilutive potential common shares to the weighted average number of common shares that were outstanding during the period. For purposes of the diluted earnings per
share calculation, outstanding stock options are considered common stock equivalents, using the treasury stock method. A

stockholders' equity. Other comprehensive income is comprised of net income and the net gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges.  pNew Accounting Pronouncements  Emerging Issues Task Force issue No02-16, Accounting by a Reseller for Cash Consideration
Received, became effective for the Company during the third quarter of fiscal 2003. This issue addresses the appropriate accounting for cash consideration received from a
vendor. The consensus reached on this issue was that cash consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the cost of sales and should be recorded as a reduction of cost of goods
sold unless the consideration is for either 1payment for assets or services and therefore revenue, or 2a reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs incurred to sell
the vendor products and therefore, a reduction of advertising expense. The Company does not track costs on a specific vendor basis. Therefore, the Company was required to classify vendor
consideration received for advertising as a reduction in cost of sales. Vendor payments received for advertising arrangements formerly classified as reductions of operating expenses have been
reclassified as a reduction of cost of sales for all the periods presented. These changes reduced cost of sales and also increased operating expenses by $114million, $105million and
$96million for the years ended July31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. This accounting change had no impact on reported operating income, net income or earnings per share for any
of the periods presented. 
In
December2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No148 SFAS148 Accounting
for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean amendment of FASB Statement No123. This statement amends SFAS123, and
provides alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value-
based method of accounting for stock-based compensation. It also requires additional disclosures about the effects on reported net income of an entity accounting policy with respect to stock-based
employee compensation. As discussed under the accounting for stock options in Note1 l, the Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and has adopted the disclosure-only alternative of SFAS123. The Company
adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS148 for fiscal 2003. 
In
April2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No149, Amendment of Statement133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. The Statement amends and clarifies financial accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in 
42  other
contracts, and for hedging activities under Statement No133. Adoption of the guidance in this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the Company consolidated
financial position or results of operations. 
In
May2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both
Liabilities and Equity. The Statement requires issuers to classify as liabilities or assets in some circumstance three classes of freestanding financial instruments that
embody obligations for the issuer. Generally, the Statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May31, 2003 and is otherwise effective at the beginning of the
first interim period beginning after June15, 2003. The Company will adopt the provisions of the Statement on August1, 2003. Adoption of the guidance in this pronouncement is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
In
November2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No45 FIN45, Guarantor Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantee, Including Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. Disclosures related to this interpretation are effective for interim and annual periods
ending after December15, 2002 and the accounting requirements are effective beginning January1, 2003. FIN45 requires all guarantees and indemnifications within its scope to be
recorded at fair value as liabilities and the disclosure of the maximum possible loss to the Company under these guarantees and indemnifications. Management has determined that FIN45 does not
have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. 
In
January2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No46 FIN46, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, an interpretation of ARB51. The primary objectives of FIN46 are to provide guidance on the identification and consolidate of variable interest
entities, or VIEs, which are entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights. The Company has completed an analysis of FIN46 and has determined that it
does not have any VIEs. 
2ACQUISITIONS

of approximately $08million. The operating results of Boulder Fruit Express have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company beginning with the acquisition date.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company recorded special charges of approximately $33million related to our Hershey division. The charges
included $14million related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Hershey, $11million related to the writedown of inventory included in cost of sales,
severance and fringe benefit costs of $05million related to cost reduction actions taken at Hershey, and $03million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and other

In September2001, the Company entered into a new line of credit with its bank. The agreement increased the amount of the credit facility to
$150million from $100million. Interest accrues, at the Company option, at the New York Prime Rate 400% at July31, 2003 and 475% at July31, 2002 or 150% above the
banks' London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR 110% and 181% at July31, 2003 and 2002, respectively and the Company has the option to fix the rate for all or a portion of the debt in
increments of 30days. The Company opted to pay 150% above LIBOR for substantially all of fiscal 2003. As more fully discussed in Note8, the Company has entered into certain interest
rate swap agreements to hedge this indebtedness. At July31, 2003 and 2002, the weighted average interest rate on the line of credit was 268% and 338%, respectively. As of July31,
2003, the Company outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement totaled $962million with an availability of $484million. The credit agreement contains certain restrictive
covenants. The Company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants at July31, 2003. The agreement also provides for the bank to syndicate the credit facility to other banks and lending
institutions. The Company has pledged all of its assets, excluding real estate, for its obligations under the credit agreement. In fiscal 2002, the proceeds received from the new credit facility were
used to refinance the Company existing credit facility consisting of a revolving loan balance of $618million and fixed rate mortgages of $183million. 
7LONG-TERM DEBT 
The Company entered into a term loan agreement with its bank effective April30, 2003. The principal amount is $300million and is repayable over
seven years based on a fifteen year amortization schedule. Interest accrues at LIBOR plus 150%. The Company has pledged certain real property as collateral for its obligations under the term loan
agreement. The proceeds were used to repay a portion 
46  of
the Company $1500million credit facility. As of July31, 2003 and 2002, the Company long-term debt consisted on the following: July31 2003
2002 Term loan payable to bank, secured by real estate, due monthly and matures in April2010, at a rate of 30 day LIBOR plus 15% 260% at July31, 2003 29,667 Equipment financing loans payable to bank, secured by the underlying assets, due monthly and maturing at various dates from March2006 through July2007, at rates ranging from 649% to 723 3,931 2,844 Promissory note due October2005, at a rate of 30 day LIBOR plus 125 235% at July31, 2003 3,595 Real estate term loans payable to bank and others, secured by building and other assets, due monthly and maturing at various dates from March2005 through April2015, at rates ranging from 750% to 860 2,494 2,867 Term loan for employee stock ownership plan, secured by stock of the Company, due $14 monthly plus interest at 855%, balance due May1, 2015 1,931 2,094 Term loans payable to bank, secured by assets, due monthly and maturing at various dates from October2003 through June2005, at rates ranging from 885% to 1157 1,348 1,530 42,966 9,335 Less: current installments 4,459 1,658 Long-term debt, excluding current installments 38,507 7,677 Certain
debt agreements contain restrictive covenants. The Company was in compliance with all of its restrictive covenants at July31, 2003. 
Aggregate
maturities of long-term debt for the next five years and thereafter are as follows at July31, 2003: Year 
In thousands 2004 4,459 2005 3,818 2006 3,502 2007 3,051 2008 2,541 2009 and thereafter 25,595 42,966 8FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
In October1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that provides for it to pay interest for a five-year period at a
fixed rate of 5% on a notional principal amount of $60million while receiving interest for the same period at the LIBOR rate on the same notional principal amount. This swap has been entered
into as a hedge against LIBOR interest rate movements on current and anticipated variable rate indebtedness totaling $60million at LIBOR plus 150%, thereby fixing the effective rate at 650%.
The five-year term of the swap agreement may be extended to seven years at 
47  the
option of the counter party, which prohibits accounting for the swap as an effective hedge under SFAS No133 SFAS133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. 
The
Company entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement effective August2001. The additional agreement provides for the Company to pay interest for a
four-year period at a fixed rate of 481% on a notional principal amount of $30million while receiving interest for the same period at the LIBOR rate on the same notional principal
amount. The swap has been entered into as a hedge against LIBOR interest rate movements on current and anticipated variable rate indebtedness totaling $30million at LIBOR plus 150%, thereby
fixing the effective rate on the notional amount at 631%. If LIBOR exceeds 60% in a given period the agreement is suspended for that period. The four-year term of the swap agreement may
be extended to six years at the option of the counter party, which prohibits accounting for the swap as an effective hedge under SFAS133. As of July31, 2003 the fair value of the above
financial instruments totaled $61million. The Company recorded other expense of $05million during fiscal 2003 to reflect the change in fair market value. 
The
Company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective May2003. The agreement provides for it to pay interest for a seven-year period at a fixed rate
of 368% on a notional principal amount of $30million while receiving interest for the same period at the LIBOR rate on the same notional principal amount. The swap has been entered into as a
hedge against LIBOR interest rate movements on current variable rate indebtedness totaling $300million at LIBOR plus 150%, thereby fixing its effective rate on the notional amount at 518%.
The swap agreement qualifies as an effective hedge under SFAS133, and the Company recorded an asset of $04million as of July31, 2003, and a corresponding credit to
accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders' equity. 9CAPITAL LEASES 
The Company leases computer, office and warehouse equipment under capital leases expiring in various years through 2008. The assets and liabilities under capital
leases are recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the assets. The assets are depreciated over the shorter of their related lease terms or their
estimated productive lives. Total capital leased assets at July31, 2003 and 2002 were $6,262, and $5,644, respectively, less accumulated depreciation of $4,106 and $3,453, respectively. Minimum
future lease payments under capital leases as of July31, 2003 for each of the next five fiscal years and in the aggregate are: Years ended July31

10COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
The Company leases various facilities under operating lease agreements with varying terms. Most of the leases contain renewal options and purchase options at
several specific dates throughout the terms of the leases. 
Rent
and other lease expense for the years ended July31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 totaled approximately $164million, $143million, and $97million,
respectively. 
Future
minimum annual fixed payments required under non-cancelable operating leases having an original term of more than one year as of July31, 2003 are as follows: Year 
In thousands 2004 14,079 2005 11,862 2006 9,766 2007 7,903 2008 5,641 Thereafter 13,717 62,968 Outstanding
commitments as of July31, 2003 for the purchase of inventory were approximately $144million. The Company had outstanding letters of credit of approximately
$68million at July31, 2003. 
The
Company may from time to time be involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of
these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial position or results of operations. 11PROFIT SHARING / SALARY REDUCTION PLANS 
The Company has several profit sharing/salary reduction plans, generally called 401k Plans the Plans, covering various employee groups. During fiscal
2003, the Company merged a number of the Plans into a single plan, and assumed two plans following its acquisitions of Blooming Prairie and Northeast Cooperative. Under these types of Plans the
employees may choose to reduce their compensation and have these amounts contributed to the Plans on their behalf. In order to become a participant in the Plans, employees must meet certain
eligibility requirements as described in the respective Plan document. In addition to amounts contributed to the Plans by employees, the Company makes contributions to the Plans on behalf of the
employees. The Company contributions to the Plans were approximately $16million, $13million, and $13million for the years ended July31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. 
12EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN 
The Company adopted the UNFI Employee Stock Ownership Plan the Plan for the purpose of acquiring outstanding shares of the Company for the benefit of eligible
employees. The Plan was effective as of November1, 1988 and has received notice of qualification by the Internal Revenue Service. 
In
connection with the adoption of the Plan, a Trust was established to hold the shares acquired. On November1, 1988, the Trust purchased 40% of the outstanding Common Stock of
the Company at a price of $4,080,000. The trustees funded this purchase by issuing promissory notes to the initial stockholders, with the Trust shares pledged as collateral. These notes bear interest
at 10% and are 
49  payable
through May2015. As the debt is repaid, shares are released from collateral and allocated to active employees, based on the proportion of debt service paid in the year. 
The
Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 93-6 SOP 93-6, Employers' Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans, in November1993. The statement provides guidance on employers' accounting for ESOPs
and is required to be applied to shares purchased by ESOPs after December31, 1992, that have not been committed to be released as of the beginning of the year of adoption. In accordance with
SOP93-6, the Company elected not to adopt the guidance in SOP93-6 for the shares held by the ESOP, all of which were purchased prior to December31,
1992. The debt of the ESOP is recorded as debt and the shares pledged as collateral are reported as unearned ESOP shares in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During each of 2003, 2002 and 2001
contributions totaling approximately $04million were made to the Trust. Of these contributions, approximately $02million represented interest in 2003, 2002 and 2001. The

July31, 2003, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $20million for state income tax purposes that expire in years 2003 through 2022. 
In
assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Due to the fact that the Company has sufficient taxable income in the federal carryback period and anticipates sufficient future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are
deductible, the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets for federal and state tax purposes, with the exception of certain state operating loss carryforwards, appears more likely than not. 
14BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
The Company has several operating segments aggregated under the distribution segment, which is the Company only reportable segment. These operating segments
have similar products and services, customer types, distribution methods and historical margins. The distribution segment is engaged in national distribution of natural foods and related products in
the United States. Other operating segments include the retail segment, which engages in the sale of natural foods and related products to the general public through retail storefronts on the east
coast of the United States, and a segment engaging in trading, roasting and packaging of nuts, seeds, dried fruit and snack items. These other 
52  operating
segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds for reportable segments and are therefore included in an Other caption in the segment information. The Other caption also includes
corporate expenses that are not allocated to operating segments.
