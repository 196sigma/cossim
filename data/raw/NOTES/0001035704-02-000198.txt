ITEM 8. QWEST CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Qwest Communications International Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Qwest
Communications International Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and
2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2001. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Qwest Communications
International Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. s/ ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, 2000 AND 1999
NOTE 1: BUSINESS AND BACKGROUND
Qwest Communications International Inc. Qwest or the Company provides
local telecommunications and related services, wireless services and directory
services in the 14-state local service area of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa,
Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota,
Utah, Washington and Wyoming local service area. The Company provides
reliable, scalable and secure broadband data, voice and image communications.
The Company provides advanced communications services and data, multimedia and
Internet-based services on a national and global basis. Qwest principally serves
global and national business and government customers, and residential and small
business customers primarily in its local service area. Qwest is incorporated
under the laws of the State of Delaware.
On June 30, 2000, Qwest completed its acquisition the Merger of U S
WEST, Inc. U S WEST. U S WEST was deemed the accounting acquirer and its
historical financial statements have been carried forward as those of the
combined company. In connection with the Merger, each outstanding share of U S
WEST common stock was converted into the right to receive 172932 shares of
Qwest common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares. In addition, all
outstanding U S WEST stock options were converted into options to acquire Qwest
common stock. All share and per share amounts for 2000 and 1999 have been
restated to give retroactive effect to the exchange ratio.
The Merger has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the
purchase method of accounting with U S WEST being deemed the accounting acquirer
and Qwest prior to the Merger or pre-Merger Qwest the acquired entity. The
total value of the consideration was approximately $400 billion, which has been
allocated to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of
pre-Merger Qwest. During the second quarter of 2001, Qwest completed the
allocation of the purchase price to the acquired net assets of pre-Merger Qwest
and adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation were recorded as

Prior to the Merger, pre-Merger Qwest investment in KPNQwest, N.V.
KPNQwest had a book value of approximately $552 million. The preliminary
purchase price allocation of $79 billion was based upon the publicly traded
Class C share price at the date of the Merger and did not consider restrictions
related to the Company Class B share investment in KPNQwest. The determination
of the fair value of the Class B shares was completed in June 2001 resulting in
a final purchase price allocation of $48 billion and required an adjustment to
the preliminary purchase price allocation of $31 billion. The excess carrying
value of the Company investment in KPNQwest over its proportionate share of
KPNQwest net equity will be amortized over 10 years. See Note 3 for
information on other adjustments made subsequent to the final purchase price
allocation relating to the KPNQwest equity investment.
At the time of the Merger, pre-Merger Qwest had net tangible assets with a
book value of approximately $30 billion. Work was completed in June 2001 to
determine the replacement cost of the fiber optic network pursuant to Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No. 16, Business Combinations. This work
58
QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
resulted in a reduction of property, plant and equipment of approximately $11
billion, which was consistent with the preliminary purchase price allocation.
The reduction in carrying value was principally due to declining replacement
cost for fiber optic network assets. There were no significant differences
between the preliminary purchase price allocation and the final appraised values
for property, plant and equipment. The remaining reduction in net tangible
assets related principally to increased liabilities associated with severance
costs for pre-Merger Qwest employees, costs to terminate redundant contracts,
adjustments to the fair value of pre-Merger Qwest obligations and transaction
costs incurred by Qwest the legal acquirer to consummate the Merger. The
preliminary allocation of purchase price to net tangible assets was adjusted
upward by approximately $300 million based upon information Qwest was actively
pursuing and able to obtain subsequent to the preliminary purchase price
allocation.
Qwest recorded deferred income taxes in the purchase price allocation,
resulting from adjustments to the Company tangible assets and liabilities and
from recording the identifiable intangible assets. Because of the tax-free
nature of the Merger, there was no corresponding increase in the tax basis of
those assets and liabilities.
The final purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of approximately
$308 billion that was amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years through
December 31, 2001. Beginning January 1, 2002, in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, the Company will no longer amortize its goodwill. As required, Qwest is
currently evaluating the impact of adopting the impairment provisions of SFAS
No. 142 and believes the effect of adoption could be a loss from a change in
accounting principle of approximately $20 billion to $30 billion. This change in
accounting principle would be reflected as a reduction in the carrying value of
goodwill.
The following unaudited pro forma results of operations are presented
assuming the Merger had been completed on January 1, 2000                                  YEAR ENDED

were required to be disposed of prior to consummation of the Merger. The
unaudited pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results that
would have been achieved if the Merger had been consummated on January 1, 2000,
nor are the results indicative of the expected future results of Qwest. Pro
forma diluted loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2000 excludes
approximately 130 million incremental shares attributable to options due to
their anti-dilutive effect as a result of the pro forma loss for that period.
For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, Qwest incurred
Merger-related and other charges totaling $449 million and $1752 billion. The
Company considered only those costs that were incremental and directly related
to the Merger to be Merger-related. The 2001 Merger-related charges are
separate from and

different than the restructuring and other similar charges recognized in the
fourth quarter of 2001 see Note 13. A breakdown of these costs is as follows                                   YEAR ENDED

Other   147      446
Total Merger-related and other charges.  $449     $1,752
Contractual settlements and legal contingencies of $115 million and $734
million for 2001 and 2000, respectively, were incurred to cancel various
commitments no longer deemed necessary as a result of the Merger and to settle
various claims related to the Merger.
In connection with the Merger, Qwest reduced employee and contractor levels
by over 14,000 people, primarily by eliminating duplicate functions. These
employees were terminated prior to December 31, 2001. Included in the 2001 and
2000 severance and employee-related charges of $187 million and $572 million,
respectively, were costs associated with payments to employees who involuntarily
left the business since the consummation of the Merger and, for 2000, $102
million in payments that were subject to the successful completion of the
Merger.
Other charges were $147 million and $446 million for 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The other charges in 2001 were comprised of $33 million related to
abandoned software, $19 million of asset impairment charges and $95 million of
professional fees, re-branding costs and other costs associated with the Merger.
The other charges in 2000 were comprised of a $226 million asset impairment
charge for access lines, $114 million relating to abandoned software, a $106
million post-retirement benefit plan curtailment gain and $212 million of
professional fees, re-branding costs and other costs associated with the Merger.
The Company considered only those costs that were incremental and directly
related to the Merger to be Merger-related.
After the Merger, the Company evaluated its assets for potential impairment
and concluded that the fair value of some of the assets was below their carrying
value. In most cases, the decline in fair value was based upon the Company
different intent as to the use of those assets or completion of projects after
the Merger. The $19 million impairment charge in 2001 was primarily associated
with certain inventory and equipment acquired before the Merger. Qwest concluded
the fair value of these items to be minimal and, therefor, the Company recorded
a charge for the full carrying value of these assets. The Company also evaluated
for impairment its dedicated special-purpose access lines that it leases to
Competitive Local Exchange Carriers CLECs. Given the industry conditions and
regulatory changes affecting CLECs in 2000, and given the fact that these access
lines have no alternative use and cannot be sold or re-deployed, the Company
concluded that the net future cash flows from the assets was negative and that
sufficient cash flow would not be generated to recover the carrying value of
those assets. Therefore, the Company concluded that the fair value of those
assets was minimal and took a $226 million charge in 2000. These assets are
operated by the Company wholesale services segment.
Following the Merger, the Company reviewed all internal software projects
in process, and determined that certain projects should no longer be pursued.
Because the projects were incomplete and abandoned, the fair value of such
software was determined to be zero. Capitalized software costs of $33 million
and $114 million were written off in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The abandoned
projects included a significant billing system replacement and a customer
database system.

Offsetting the 2000 Merger-related costs was a $106 million post-retirement
benefit plan curtailment gain. This gain resulted from the post-Merger
termination of retiree medical benefits for all former U S WEST employees who
did not have 20 years of service by December 31, 2000 or would not be service
pension eligible by December 31, 2003.
The 2001 Merger-related and other charges of $449 million were net of $164
million in reversals of previously recorded Merger accruals. The reversals were
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 and resulted from favorable developments
in the underlying matters.

In 1999, U S WEST and Global Crossing Ltd. Global Crossing agreed to
terminate their merger agreement. In consideration for terminating the merger
agreement, U S WEST paid Global Crossing $140 million in cash and tendered
2,231,076 shares that U S WEST previously purchased in the open market of
Global Crossing common stock for which U S WEST paid $140 million. These
termination payments, together with costs of approximately $2 million, were
charged to other expense in 1999. Qwest also agreed to purchase $140 million in
services from Global Crossing over four years at the best commercially available
prices offered by Global Crossing. As of December 31, 2001, Qwest had fully met
its purchase commitment under this agreement.

NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of presentation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and all material majority-owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany amounts and transactions have been
eliminated.
Use of estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the
Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and
disclosures reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications. Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to
conform to the current year presentation.
Change in accounting principle. Prior to 1999, Qwest Dex, Inc. Dex
recognized revenues and expenses related to publishing directories using the
deferral method, under which revenues and expenses were recognized over the
lives of the directories, generally one year. Effective January 1, 1999, Dex
changed to the point of publication method of accounting, under which the
Company recognizes revenues and expenses at the time the directory is published.
This change in methodology was made to better align Dex revenue and expense
recognition with the earnings process and to better reflect the seasonal
operating activity of the business. The change in accounting principle resulted
in an increase in net income of $240 million net of income tax of $153
million, or $027 per diluted share, which is reported as the cumulative effect
as of January 1, 1999 of a change in accounting principle. The Company
restated its 1999 quarterly results of operations to give effect to the point of
publication method. The restatement increased net income by $13 million, or
$001 per diluted share.
Revenue recognition. Revenues for services are recognized when the
services are provided. Payments received in advance are deferred until the
service is provided. Up-front fees received, primarily activation fees and
installation charges, are deferred and recognized over the longer of the
contractual period or the expected customer relationship, generally 2 to 10
years. Expected customer relationship periods are generally estimated using
historical data of actual customer retention patterns.
Directory revenue is recognized at the time of publication. Changes in
publishing schedules may impact the timing of the recognition of directory
revenue. The amount of directory revenue may also be affected by changes in the
number of directories published and the period covered by certain directories.
Design, engineering and installation contracts for certain customer premise
equipment agreements are accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method
of accounting. The percentage-of-completion method is calculated using either
the ratio of total actual costs incurred to date to the estimated total project
costs or actual labor hours to total estimated labor hours for the project. This
percentage is then applied to the estimated total revenue for the project to
determine the amount of revenue to be recorded.
The Company has sold optical capacity also referred to as indefeasible
rights of use or IRUs on its network primarily to other telecommunications
service providers in the form of sales of specific channels on Qwest lit
network or sales of specific dark fiber strands. Revenues from transactions
related to sales of optical capacity that meet the criteria of a sales-type
lease are recognized at the time the optical capacity is delivered to and
accepted by the customer. If the requirements for sales-type lease accounting
are not met, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. The
Company concludes IRUs are sales-type leases for accounting purposes and
recognizes revenue at the time delivery and acceptance of the fiber or capacity
takes place so long as: 1 Qwest receives sufficient consideration; 2 x
Qwest has passed substantially all risks and rewards of ownership to the fiber
or capacity, including responsibility for operation and maintenance cost and
risk of technological or economic obsolescence, to the customer, y Qwest does
not have substantial continuing involvement with the capacity sold, and z
ownership has passed or will pass

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
by the end of the agreement; and 3 the customer receives a specific fiber or
channel on the Qwest network that only the customer can utilize.
When Qwest acquires and sells optical capacity to a company in the same
period in separate cash transactions, the Company generally applies the guidance
in Accounting Principles Board ABP Opinion No. 29, Accounting for
Nonmonetary Transactions, and Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No.
01-02, Interpretations of APB Opinion No. 29, to those transactions. Qwest
recognizes revenue based on fair value for these contemporaneous transactions
principally based on the following factors: 1 whether the assets exchanged are
dissimilar assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business for assets
to be used to provide telecommunication services, 2 whether fair value can be
determined within reasonable limits and 3 whether from an accounting
perspective, the earnings process is complete.
As required, the Company will adopt SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, as of January 1, 2002. SFAS No.
144 requires that a long-lived asset to be disposed of other than by sale be
classified as held and used until its disposition. As a result, the Company
believes it can no longer recognize revenue from optical capacity asset sales.
The Company routinely sells optical and customer premise equipment. Revenue
is recognized upon shipment and acceptance by the customer when the Company acts
as a principal in such transactions.
Advertising costs. Costs related to advertising are generally expensed as
incurred. Advertising expense was $279 million, $470 million and $308 million in
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Income taxes. The provision for income taxes consists of an amount for
taxes currently payable and an amount for tax consequences deferred to future
periods. Investment tax credits earned prior to their repeal by the Tax Reform
Act of 1986 are amortized as reductions in income tax expense over the lives of
the assets which gave rise to the credits.
Cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily
convertible into cash and are not subject to significant risk from fluctuations
in interest rates. As a result, the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents
approximates their fair value. The Company cash balances may exceed federally
insured deposit limits. However, the Company seeks to maintain cash and cash
equivalent balances with financial institutions it deems to be of sound
financial condition.
Bank overdrafts of $267 million and $425 million as of December 31, 2001
and 2000, respectively, were included in accounts payable.
Receivables. The Company has agreements with other telecommunications
services providers whereby Qwest agrees to bill and collect for certain of the
other telecommunications providers services rendered to the Company customers
within the local service area. The Company purchases these accounts receivable
from the other telecommunications services providers on a full-recourse basis
and includes these amounts in its accounts receivable balance. The amount of the
purchased receivables included in Qwest December 31, 2001 and 2000 accounts
receivable balances were $217 million and $294 million, respectively. The
Company has not experienced any significant losses under the recourse provisions
related to these purchased receivables.
Qwest also has billing and collection arrangements with other
telecommunications services providers for certain services provided by the
Company to customers outside the local service area. While these amounts are
generally billed by the telecommunications services providers on behalf of
Qwest, the Company continues to include the receivables in its accounts
receivable balance due to the full recourse provisions of the billing and
collection agreements.

The fair value of accounts receivable balances approximates their carrying
value because of their short-term nature. Qwest is exposed to concentrations of
credit risk from customers within its local service area and from other
telecommunications providers. Qwest generally does not require collateral to
secure its receivable balances.
Inventories. Inventories held for sale primarily wireless handsets are
carried at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis.
Inventories used internally are carried at average cost, except for significant
individual items that are valued based upon specific costs.
Property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment is carried at
cost and is depreciated using straight-line group methods. Generally, under the
group method, when an asset is sold or retired, the cost is deducted from
property, plant and equipment and charged to accumulated depreciation without
recognition of a gain or loss. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
shorter of the useful lives of the assets or the lease term. Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes
interest incurred during the construction phase of its network. Capitalized
interest is reported as a cost of the network asset and a reduction to interest
expense.
The Company enters into agreements to obtain optical capacity from other
telecommunications services providers. These agreements are accounted for as
either capital leases, operating leases or service agreements depending on the
terms of the transaction. Optical capacity agreements that meet the criteria of
a capital lease are included in the Company property, plant and equipment
balances.
Impairment of long-lived assets. Long-lived assets such as goodwill,
intangibles and property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment
whenever facts and circumstances warrant such a review. Under current standards,
the assets must be carried at historical cost if the projected cash flows from
their use will recover their carrying amounts on an undiscounted basis and
without considering interest. However, if projected cash flows are less than the
carrying amount, even by one dollar, the long-lived assets must be reduced to
their estimated fair value.
Effective January 1, 2002, the Company must adopt SFAS No. 142. SFAS No.
142 provides a more restrictive fair value test to evaluating goodwill and
intangibles for impairment. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, the carrying value of
goodwill will be evaluated based upon its current fair value as if the purchase
price allocation occurred on January 1, 2002. Qwest is currently evaluating the
impact of adopting the standard and believes the effect of adoption could be a
loss from a change in accounting principle of approximately $20 billion to $30
billion. This change in accounting principle would be reflected as a reduction
in the carrying value of goodwill in 2002.

Customer acquisition costs. The Company defers the initial direct cost of
obtaining a customer to the extent of customer revenue generated from
installation fees. Deferred customer acquisition costs are amortized over the
expected life of the customer relationship.
Intangibles. Intangible assets arising from business combinations were
initially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line basis over
their estimated useful lives. The components of intangibles were as follows                                      DECEMBER 31,

Goodwill and other intangible

Given the deterioration in the market for telecommunications services, the
Company reviewed its goodwill for impairment at December 31, 2001. Current
standards require use of undiscounted cash flows, without consideration of
interest, for impairment tests. Based upon those standards and using the
Company long-range plan, no impairment was recognized at December 31, 2001.
Effective January 1, 2002, goodwill will periodically be evaluated for
impairment under SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 142 applies a more restrictive fair
value test for impairment. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
this new pronouncement on its intangible assets. Qwest believes the effect of
adoption could be a loss from a change in accounting principle of approximately
$20 billion to $30 billion. This change in accounting principle would be
reflected as a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill in 2002. Also, under
SFAS No. 142, goodwill and certain intangibles will no longer be amortized
beginning January 1, 2002. The decrease in amortization expense in 2002 will be
approximately $900 million.
Computer software. Internally used software, whether purchased or
developed, is capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over an
estimated useful life of 18 months to 5 years. In accordance with Statement of
Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed
or Obtained for Internal Use, the Company capitalizes certain costs associated
with internally developed software such as payroll costs of employees devoting
time to the projects and external direct costs for materials and services. Costs
associated with internally developed software to be used internally is expensed
until the point the project has reached the development stage. Subsequent
additions, modifications or upgrades to internal-use software are capitalized
only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously
did not perform. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the
period in which they are incurred. Unamortized computer software costs of $1799
billion and $1173 billion as of December 2001 and 2000, respectively, which are
net of $578 million and $498 million of accumulated amortization, respectively,
are included in intangibles and property, plant and equipment. Amortization of
capitalized computer software costs totaled $425 million, $308 million and $193
million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively and was included with depreciation
in the accompanying statements of operations. During 2001 and 2000, $101 million
and $114 million, respectively, of capitalized computer software costs were
written-off because several projects were abandoned, including a significant
billing system replacement project and a

customer database system project in 2000. The charges were recorded with the
restructuring, Merger-related and other charges.
Investments. Investments where the Company exercises significant influence
but does not control the investee are accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. Under the equity method, investments are stated at initial cost and
are adjusted for contributions, distributions and the Company share of income
or losses. The Company share of investee income or losses are recorded one
month in arrears.
Equity investments where the Company cannot exercise significant influence
over the investee are carried at cost or, if the security is publicly traded, at
fair market value. Realized gains and losses on securities are determined on the
specific identification method and are included in current earnings. For
publicly traded securities, unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, are included
in other comprehensive income.
The Company reviews its portfolio of equity securities on a quarterly basis
to determine whether a decline in value is other than temporary. Many factors
are considered in assessing whether a decline in value is other than temporary,
including, as may be appropriate   - Earnings trends and asset quality   - Near term prospects and financial condition of the issuer   - Financial condition and prospects of the issuer region and industry   - The cause and severity of the decline in market price   - Analysts recommendations and stock price projections   - The length of time generally six to nine months that market value was
less than the carrying value   - Stock price volatility and near term potential for recovery; and
- Qwest intent and ability to retain the investment.
If Qwest determines that the decline in value of an equity security is
other than temporary, the Company will record a charge on its statement of
operations to reduce the carrying value of the security to its estimated fair
value.
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Accrued expenses and other
current liabilities consisted of the following                                  DECEMBER 31,

QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
The fair value of accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current
liabilities approximates their carrying amount because of their short-term
nature.
Pension and post-retirement benefits. Pension and post-retirement health
care and life insurance benefits earned by employees during the year as well as
interest on projected benefit obligations are accrued currently. Prior service
costs and credits resulting from changes in plan benefits are amortized over the
average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.
In computing the pension and post-retirement benefit costs, the Company
must make numerous assumptions about such things as employee mortality and
turnover, expected salary and wage increases, discount rates, expected return on
plan assets and expected future cost increases. Two of these items generally
have a significant impact on the level of cost -- discount rate and expected
rate of return on plan assets.
The expected rate of return on plan assets is the long-term rate of return
the Company expects to earn on the pension trust assets. Qwest establishes its
expected rate of return by reviewing the investment composition of its pension
plan assets, obtaining advice from its actuaries, reviewing historical earnings
on the pension trust assets and evaluating current and expected market
conditions.
Annually, the Company sets its discount rate primarily based upon the
average interest rate during the month of December for a Moody AA rated
corporate bond.
To compute its expected return on pension plan assets, the Company applies
its expected rate of return to the market-related value of the pension plan
assets. The market-related asset value is a computed value that recognizes
changes in fair value of pension plan assets over a period of time, not to
exceed five years. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers' Accounting for
Pensions, the Company elected to recognize actual returns on its pension plan
assets ratably over a five-year period when computing its market-related value
of pension plan assets. The election was made in 1987 when SFAS No. 87 became
effective. This method has the effect of smoothing market volatility that may be
experienced from year to year. As a result, the Company expected return is not
significantly impacted by the actual return on pension plan assets experienced
in the current year.
Derivative instruments. The Company occasionally enters into derivative
financial instruments. The objective of the Company interest rate risk
management program is to manage the level and volatility of its interest
expense. The Company may also employ financial derivatives to hedge foreign
currency exposures associated with particular debt. This objective was achieved
in 2001 through the type of debt issued and a cross-currency swap that converted
foreign-denominated debt to U.S. dollar-denominated debt.
Under a cross-currency swap, the Company agrees with another party to
exchange U.S. dollars for foreign currency based on a notional amount, at
specified intervals over a defined term. The Company designed its cross-currency
swaps as hedges of its borrowings and these swaps were effective during 2001.
The cross-currency swaps were carried at fair value on the balance sheet with
changes in fair value included in other comprehensive income. All cross-currency
swaps expired in November 2001.
The Company also entered into equity swaps to modify its risk exposure to
changes in the market price of the Global Crossing common stock previously owned
by the Company. Under these equity swaps, the Company agreed with another party
to exchange payments based on a notional amount at specific intervals over a
defined term. In exchange for making payments based upon an interest rate index,
the Company received rendered payments based upon increases decreases in the
market price of Global Crossing common stock. Qwest sold its remaining shares of
Global Crossing in 2000; however, the equity swaps matured in increments through
August 2001. These swaps were carried at fair value with changes in fair value
included in income.
The following table summarizes the terms of outstanding cross-currency and
equity swaps at December 31, 2000. There were none outstanding at December 31,
2001. Cross-currency swaps were tied to the Swiss

on the equity swaps were tied to changes in the market price of Global Crossing
common shares and paid rates were tied to one- and three-month London Interbank
Offered Rates LIBOR. Equity collars had also been entered into in
conjunction with the equity swaps to limit the magnitude of any gains or losses
on the equity swaps. The Swiss Franc borrowings and the equity swaps matured in
2001.                                DECEMBER 31, 2000

Exit costs and restructuring reserves. Periodically, the Company commits
to exit certain business activities, eliminate office or facility locations

depends upon various assumptions, including future severance costs, sublease or

inherently judgmental and may change based upon actual experience.
New accounting standards. In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities. This statement establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS No. 133
requires, among other things, that all derivative instruments be recognized at
fair value as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and
changes in fair value generally be recognized currently in earnings unless
specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on
January 1, 2001 did not have a material impact on Qwest consolidated financial
results.
In September 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. This
statement provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and
servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities. SFAS No. 140
requires that after a transfer of financial assets, an entity continues to
recognize the financial and servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it
has incurred and does not recognize those financial and servicing assets when
control has been surrendered and the liability has been extinguished. SFAS No.
140 is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and
extinguishments of liabilities occurring after March 31, 2001. The adoption of
SFAS No. 140 did not have a material impact on Qwest consolidated financial
results.
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. This
pronouncement eliminated the use of the pooling of interests method of
accounting for all mergers and acquisitions. As a result, all mergers and
acquisitions will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
SFAS No. 141 is effective for all mergers and acquisitions initiated after June
30, 2001. Adoption of this pronouncement had no impact on Qwest consolidated
financial results.
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for
intangible assets excluding goodwill acquired individually or with a group of
other assets at the time of their acquisition. It also addresses financial
accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to
their acquisition. Intangible assets excluding goodwill acquired outside of a
business combination will be initially recorded at their estimated fair value.
If the intangible asset has a finite useful life, it will be amortized over that
life. Intangible assets with an indefinite life are not amortized. Both types of
intangible assets will be reviewed annually for impairment and a loss recorded
when the asset carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The impairment
test for intangible assets consists of comparing the fair value of the
intangible asset to its carrying value. Fair value for goodwill and intangible
assets is determined based upon discounted cash flows and appraised values. If

value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is
recognized. Goodwill will be treated similar to an intangible asset with an
indefinite life. As required, the Company will adopt SFAS No. 142 effective
January 1, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 142 will reduce Qwest amortization
expense by approximately $900 million annually, beginning January 1, 2002.
Because goodwill amortization expense is non-deductible for tax purposes, the
impact on net income should be an increase of approximately $900 million. Upon
adoption of SFAS No. 142, the carrying value of goodwill will be evaluated based
upon its current fair value as if the purchase price allocation occurred on
January 1, 2002. Qwest is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the
standard and believes the effect of adoption could be a loss from a change in
accounting principle of approximately $20 billion to $30 billion. This change in
accounting principle would be reflected as a reduction in the carrying value of
goodwill in 2002.
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations. This statement deals with the costs of closing
facilities and removing assets. SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the
fair value of a legal liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period
it is incurred. This cost is initially capitalized and amortized over the
remaining life of the underlying asset. Once the obligation is ultimately
settled, any difference between the final cost and the recorded liability is
recognized as a gain or loss on disposition. As required, the Company will adopt
SFAS No. 143 effective January 1, 2003. Qwest is currently evaluating the impact
this pronouncement will have on its future consolidated financial results.
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. This pronouncement addresses how
to account for and report impairments or disposals of long-lived assets. Under
SFAS No. 144, an impairment loss is to be recorded on long-lived assets being
held or used when the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable from its
expected future undiscounted cash flows. The impairment loss is equal to the
difference between the asset carrying amount and estimated fair value. In
addition, SFAS No. 144 requires long-lived assets to be disposed of by other
than a sale for cash to be accounted for and reported like assets being held and
used. Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are to be recorded at the
lower of their carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell at
the time the plan of disposition has been approved and committed to by the
appropriate company management. SFAS No. 144 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 144,
Qwest will no longer recognize revenues from optical capacity asset sales under
sales-type leases.
On July 19, 2001, the EITF issued its consensus regarding EITF Issue 00-11,
Meeting the Ownership Transfer Requirements of FASB Statement No. 13 for Leases
of Real Estate. This issue is primarily concerned with ownership transfer
requirements for a sales-type lease of property under SFAS No. 13. According to
the consensus, integral equipment subject to a lease should be evaluated as real
estate under SFAS No. 13, as amended by SFAS No. 98. In addition, the consensus
states that a nominal purchase option contained in a lease does not satisfy the
transfer of ownership criterion in SFAS No. 13 for transfers of real property,
if the failure to pay the nominal amount results in ownership not being
transferred to the lessee. EITF 00-11 provides, however, that this criterion
will be met in cases involving integral equipment or property improvements when
the lessor agrees, regardless of whether or not the lessee pays any amount, to
execute and deliver to the lessee all documents including, if applicable, a
bill of sale that may be required to release the property from the lease and
transfer ownership to the lessee. The consensus on EITF 00-11 applies to leases
entered into after July 19, 2001 and to certain leases modified after that date.
Qwest believes it is in compliance with the requirements of SFAS No. 13 and the
EITF consensus for IRU transactions entered into after the issuance of the EITF
consensus that it treated as sales-type leases.
NOTE 3: INVESTMENTS
Investment in KPNQwest. In April 1999, Qwest and KPN Telecom B.V. KPN
formed KPNQwest, a joint venture to create a pan-European Internet Protocol
IP-based fiber optic network, linked to Qwest network in North America,
for data and multimedia services. Qwest and KPN each initially

owned 50% of KPNQwest. On November 12, 1999, KPNQwest consummated an initial
public offering KPNQwest IPO whereby 506 million shares of common stock
were issued to the public generating approximately $10 billion in proceeds. As
a result of KPNQwest IPO, the public owns approximately 11% of KPNQwest
shares and the remainder were owned equally by Qwest and KPN.
On November 30, 2001, Qwest purchased approximately 14 million additional
shares of KPNQwest common stock, and Anschutz Company, Qwest principal
stockholder, purchased approximately 6 million shares, from KPN for $458 per
share. Qwest now owns approximately 475% of the voting power of the KPNQwest
stock and its principal shareholder owns approximately 15%. As part of the
transaction, KPN granted Qwest an option that expired on March 31, 2002, to
purchase some or all of KPN shares in KPNQwest at fair value on the date of
exercise. In addition, all restrictions on the transfer of shares were removed
from Qwest shares but KPN shares are still subject to restrictions through
2004. Qwest will continue to account for its proportionate share of KPNQwest
operations under the equity method of accounting and, because it is no longer a
corporate joint venture, will begin recognizing deferred taxes on its
proportionate share of KPNQwest operations as discussed in Note 8.
The Company investment in KPNQwest was approximately $13 billion at
December 31, 2001. Qwest investment exceeded its proportionate share of
KPNQwest net assets by $840 million at December 31, 2001. The excess basis was
being amortized over 10 years. In connection with its adoption of SFAS No. 142,
Qwest will no longer amortize this excess basis beginning in 2002.

stock was $715. Subsequent to December 31, 2001, the stock price of KPNQwest
common stock declined significantly below Qwest carrying value. In accordance
with the Company policy to review the carrying value of marketable securities
on a quarterly basis for other than temporary declines in value, Qwest will
assess the factors it uses to determine fair value of the KPNQwest common stock,
including the difficult financial condition and prospects of KPNQwest and the
rest of the European telecommunications industry, the severity of the decline of
the stock price and the near term potential for stock price recovery, in
determining the timing and amount of a further write-down, which Qwest believes
is likely and believes may be significant in amount. You can find additional
information about Qwest application of factors used to determine the
write-down of the carrying value of KPNQwest common stock in Note 2 to the

Investment in Qwest Digital Media, LLC. In October 1999, Qwest and
Anschutz Digital Media, Inc. ADMI, an affiliate of Anschutz Company, formed
a joint venture called Qwest Digital Media, LLC QDM that provided advanced
digital production, post-production and transmission facilities, digital media
storage and distribution services, telephony-based data storage and enhanced
services, access and routing services. Qwest contributed approximately $848
million in the form of a promissory note payable over nine years at an annual
interest rate of 6%. At inception, Qwest and ADMI each owned a 50% equity and
voting interest in the joint venture. In June 2000, Qwest acquired an additional
25% interest in QDM directly from ADMI. Qwest paid approximately $482 million
for the interest; approximately $48 million in cash was paid at closing and the
remaining $434 million was paid, with approximately $18 million in interest,
on January 2, 2001. Following this transaction, Qwest owned a 75% economic
interest and 50% voting interest in QDM and ADMI owned a 25% economic interest
and a 50% voting interest. During 2001 and 2000, the Company made additional
capital contributions of approximately $11 million and $21 million,
respectively.
In October 1999, Qwest also agreed to purchase certain telephony-related
assets and all of the stock of Precision Systems, Inc., a telecommunications
solutions provider, from ADMI in exchange for a promissory note in the amount of
approximately $34 million. The note bears interest at 6% annually with
semi-annual interest payments and annual principal payments due through 2008.
In October 1999, Qwest entered into a long-term Master Services Agreement
the MSA with QDM under which QDM agreed to purchase approximately $119
million of telecommunication services through October 2008 and Qwest agreed to
extend credit to QDM for the purpose of making payments for the
telecommunication services. Each October, QDM would be required to pay Qwest an
amount equal to the difference between certain specified annual commitment
levels and the amount of services actually purchased under the MSA at that time.
In October 2001, Qwest agreed to release QDM from its obligation to acquire
telecommunications services from Qwest in exchange for QDM forgiving Qwest
$848 million promissory note after giving effect to a payment by Qwest of $25
million in accrued interest and $13 million in principal on the note. Prior to
termination of the MSA, Qwest advanced QDM the amount QDM owed for accrued
telecommunications services of $38 million and QDM applied the advance to pay
Qwest the amount owing for the services, including interest on amounts past due.
Concurrently with terminating the MSA, QDM repaid the $38 million advance under
the MSA.
During 2001, Qwest recorded a charge of $15 million that represented its
share of an impairment charge recorded by QDM. In December 2001, Qwest
management made a decision to discontinue funding QDM, resulting in a charge of
$18 million. In February 2002, a determination was made to discontinue the QDM
business.

The Company reviews its portfolio of equity securities on a quarterly
basis. See Note 2 for the factors considered in assessing whether a decline in
value is other than temporary.
KPNQwest Write-down. The carrying value of pre-Merger Qwest investment
in KPNQwest was $552 million. On June 30, 2000, Qwest preliminary estimate of
the value of its investment in KPNQwest was $79 billion. This preliminary
estimate was based upon the closing price of $39625 of KPNQwest publicly
traded Class C shares on June 30, 2000. Qwest ownership in KPNQwest was held
in Class B shares. These Class B shares were subject to restrictions on
marketability through 2004 unlike the Class C shares. Work was performed during
2000 and 2001 to determine the fair value of the Class B shares as of June 30,
2000. The work did not consider events and circumstances occurring after June
30, 2000.
The work was completed in June 2001, and indicated a fair value for the
Company investment in KPNQwest of $48 billion or $23775 per Class B share.
Accordingly, the carrying value of the KPNQwest investment was adjusted, in
accordance with APB Opinion No. 16, to equal the $48 billion fair value.
At June 30, 2001, Qwest evaluated its investment in KPNQwest and concluded
that the decline in fair value from $48 billion was other than temporary.
Factors considered in reaching this conclusion included the following, among
others      1. KPNQwest stock price had fallen and remained below $23775 per
share from March 2001. The period of time the market price was below the
Company carrying value and the severity of the decline indicated that the
decline had become other than temporary.
2. Analysts had released new recommendations during the second quarter
of their stock price targets for KPNQwest that showed a significant decline
from the first quarter.
3. The European telecom sector had experienced a severe deterioration
during the second quarter, including numerous bankruptcies, making the near
term prospects of KPNQwest stock recovery less certain at June 30, 2001.
As a result of the evaluation of Qwest investment in KPNQwest, the
Company concluded that the fair value of its investment at June 30, 2001 was
$13 billion and took a charge of $3048 billion to reduce the carrying value to
the estimated fair value of $667 per Class B share.
QDM write-down. During 2001, Qwest recorded a charge of $15 million that
represented its share of an impairment charge recorded by QDM. In December 2001,
Qwest management made a decision to abandon its investment in QDM and
discontinue funding, resulting in a charge of $18 million.

in Lucent common stock with a cost basis of $402 million at December 31, 2000.
At June 30, 2001, Qwest evaluated its investment in Lucent and concluded that
the decline in fair value below its carrying value was other than temporary.
Factors considered in reaching this conclusion included the following      1. The period of time Lucent stock price was below Qwest carrying
amount per share.
2. The magnitude by which Lucent did not meet analysts' first quarter
2001 earnings estimates.
3. A decline in the number of analysts with buy recommendations.
4. The announced termination of merger discussions with a large
European telecommunications equipment manufacturer.
As a result of the evaluation of the Company investment in Lucent, Qwest
concluded that the fair value of the investment at June 30, 2001 was $42
million and took a charge of $36 million to reduce the investment from its
carrying value to its fair value.
In addition to Lucent, charges totaling $23 million were recorded during
2001 relating to other than temporary declines in market value of the Company
portfolio of publicly traded marketable securities. In 2000, the Company
recorded a charge of $447 million relating to a decline in the value of its
investment in Global Crossing that was considered other than temporary.
Other equity security write-downs. During 2001, the Company periodically
reviewed its portfolio of investments in non-publicly traded equity securities
for possible impairment of value. As a result of these reviews, Qwest recorded
net charges throughout 2001 of $154 million relating to an impairment of value
associated with investments in non-public companies. The carrying value of these
investments at December 31, 2001 was $11 million.
Decline in market value of derivatives. On August 22, 2001, Qwest settled
derivative contracts associated with its previously-owned equity investment in
Global Crossing. These derivatives were recorded at market value with any change
in market value taken immediately to income. Due to a decline in the market
value of the derivatives, the Company recorded charges of $7 million, $470
million and $56 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Assets held for sale. During 2000 and 1999, U S WEST agreed to sell
approximately 800,000 access lines to third-party telecommunications services
providers, including approximately 570,000 access lines to Citizens
Communications Company Citizens in nine states. Because these access lines
were held for sale, U S WEST discontinued recognizing depreciation expense on
these assets and recorded them at the lower of their cost or fair value, less
estimated cost to sell.
On July 20, 2001, Qwest terminated its agreement with Citizens under which
the majority of the remaining access lines in eight states were to have been
sold and ceased actively marketing the remaining lines. As a result, the
remaining access lines were reclassified as being held for use as of June 30,
2001. The access lines were measured individually at the lower of their a
carrying value before they were classified as held for sale, adjusted for any
depreciation amortization expense or impairment losses that would have been
recognized had the assets been continuously classified as held for use, or b
their fair value at June 30, 2001. The required adjustments to the carrying
value of the individual access lines were included in operating income for 2001.
This resulted in a charge to depreciation of $222 million to catch-up the
depreciation on these access lines for the period they were held for sale.
In 2001, Qwest sold approximately 41,000 access lines in Utah and Arizona
resulting in $94 million in proceeds and a gain of $51 million. In 2000, Qwest
also completed the sale of approximately 20,000 access lines in North Dakota and
South Dakota resulting in proceeds of $19 million and a gain of $11 million.
As of December 31, 2000, Qwest identified approximately $500 million of
bandwidth capacity on its existing network that was held for sale to
telecommunications providers and others. In connection with the Merger, this
capacity was recorded at fair value, less estimated cost to complete and sell.
As of January 1, 2002, all capacity had been reclassified as held for sale or
use pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 144.
Qwest has built its network outside North America primarily by entering
into long-term agreements to acquire optical capacity. Qwest has also acquired
some capacity within North America under similar contracts. Several of the
companies for example, Global Crossing, Enron Broadband Services, Inc. and
360networks USA, Inc. from which Qwest has acquired capacity appear to be in
financial difficulty or have filed for bankruptcy protection. Bankruptcy courts
have wide discretion and could deny Qwest the continued benefits of use of the
assets under the capacity agreements without relieving Qwest of its obligation
to make payments or requiring the refund of amounts previously paid. Qwest
believes that it is taking appropriate

actions to protect its investments and maintain on-going use of the acquired
capacity. At this time, it is too early to determine what affect the
bankruptcies will have with respect to the acquired capacity or Qwest ability
to use this acquired capacity.

The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper was 298% and 733%
at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
At December 31, 2001, Qwest maintained commercial paper programs to finance
the short-term operating cash needs of the business. As of December 31, 2001,
the Company had a $40 billion syndicated credit facility to support its
commercial paper programs. The syndicated credit facility matures on May 3,
2002. As of December 31, 2001, there was no outstanding balance. Qwest has the
option to convert any borrowed amount into a one-year term loan that would be
due in May 2003 provided Qwest is not in default of the credit facility,
including compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2002. The syndicated credit
facility agreement requires Qwest to pay a quarterly fee based upon the
Company long-term debt agency ratings. The facility fee on the total credit
facility available ranged from 007% to 008% annually. The facility also
contained financial covenants, the most restrictive of which was a requirement
to maintain a debt-to-consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 375-to-1.
Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the credit facility is a measure of EBITDA
that starts with the Company net income and adds back certain items, primarily
those of a non-cash or a non-operating nature. You can find additional
information concerning borrowings against the syndicated credit facility after
December 31, 2001 in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.

The Company borrowings have a fair value of $245 billion and $184
billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The fair values of the
Company borrowings are based on quoted market prices where available or, if
not available, based on discounting future cash flows using current interest
rates. With the exception of approximately $11 billion in debt held by Qwest
the parent company, the Company long-term borrowings were held in three
wholly-owned subsidiaries, Qwest Corporation, Qwest Communications Corporation
and Qwest Capital Funding, Inc. QCF. The borrowings of QCF are guaranteed by
the parent company, Qwest. For information concerning the Company borrowing
activities after December 31, 2001, see Note 15.
The portion of debt that is public debt either assumed by Qwest in the
Merger or issued following the Merger referred to as Post-Merger public debt
had an outstanding balance of $199 billion at December 31, 2001. This
Post-Merger public debt has no financial covenants and contains no cross-default
or cross-acceleration provisions. At December 31, 2001 Qwest had public debt
that was issued by Qwest prior to the Merger referred to as Pre-Merger public
debt with an outstanding balance of $14 billion. Of the Pre-Merger public
debt, $10 billion has no financial covenants as long as Qwest maintains an
investment grade debt rating. If the Company fails to maintain an investment
grade rating, the most restrictive covenant that would apply would be a
limitation on the incurrence of debt. The limitations on incurrence of debt
would apply if, after application of the proceeds, the ratio of debt to
consolidated cash flow available for fixed charges as defined in the indenture
for the four full quarters preceding the incurrence would be 50-to-1 or higher.
This portion of the Pre-Merger public debt contains provisions relating to
acceleration upon an acceleration of debt obligations in the aggregate in excess
of $10 million, including the syndicated credit facility and any of the
Post-Merger public debt. The remaining portion of the Pre-Merger public debt
approximately $350 million has no financial covenants but does contain
provisions relating to acceleration upon an acceleration of debt obligations in
the aggregate in excess of $25 million.

In March 2001, the Company completed a cash tender to buy back certain
outstanding debt. In the tender offer, the Company repurchased approximately
$995 million in principal $12 billion in face value of outstanding debt. As a
result of the repurchase, the Company incurred $106 million $65 million after
tax in premium payments. The tender offer was conducted to retire the bonds
because of their high coupon rates and to reduce interest cost to the Company.
In connection with this tender offer, the indentures were amended to eliminate
restrictive covenants and certain default provisions. See Note 15 for subsequent
events concerning debt ratings.
The Company is currently in compliance with all financial covenants in its
credit facility and indentures including any covenants suspended while the
Company maintains its investment grade credit rating as of the last measurement
date.
NOTE 6: LEASE ARRANGEMENTS
Operating leases. Certain office facilities, real estate and equipment are
subject to operating leases. The Company also has easement agreements with
railroads and public transportation authorities that are accounted for as
operating leases.
During 2001, the Company entered into an operating lease arrangement
synthetic lease under which the Company had the option to purchase the
leased real estate properties at any time during the lease term. This synthetic
lease facility had a capacity of approximately $305 million, although only
approximately $177 million had been utilized at December 31, 2001. This
synthetic lease, in combination with approximately $77 million of previously
existing synthetic leases, had certain financial covenants. The total debt held
by these lessors related to the property leased to Qwest was $254 million at
December 31, 2001. See Note 15 for additional information on the termination of
the synthetic lease facilities.
Rent expense, net of sublease rentals, under these operating and synthetic
leases was $696 million, $528 million and $269 million during 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively.
Capital leases. The Company leases certain office facilities and equipment
under various capital lease arrangements. Assets acquired through capital leases
during 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $1282 billion, $678 million and $113 million,
respectively. Assets recorded under capitalized lease agreements included in
property, plant and equipment consisted of $2283 billion and $1182 billion of
cost less accumulated amortization of $392 million and $276 million at December
31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Capital lease obligations are included in current and long-term borrowings
on the Company balance sheet.
NOTE 7: EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
PENSION, POST-RETIREMENT AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
Qwest has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan the Pension
Plan for substantially all management and occupational union employees.
Post-retirement healthcare and life insurance plans provide medical, dental,
vision and life insurance benefits for certain retirees. The Company also
provides post-employment benefits for certain former employees.
In conjunction with the Merger, the Company made the following changes to
its employee benefit plans for management employees only. Effective September 7,
2000, employees were not eligible to receive retiree medical and life benefits
unless they had either at least 20 years of service by December 31, 2000 or
would be service pension eligible by December 31, 2003. The elimination of the
retiree medical benefits decreased the other post-employment benefits expense
for 2000 by approximately $17 million. In addition, the elimination was
accounted for as a plan curtailment, resulting in a gain of approximately $106
million. This gain was recorded as an offset to Merger-related costs. Employees
who retained the benefits will begin paying contributions in 2004 except for
those employees who retired prior to September 7, 2000.
Pension benefits for management employees prior to January 1, 2001 were
based upon their salary and years of service while occupational employee
benefits were generally based upon job classification and years of service.
Qwest also modified the Pension Plan benefits, effective January 1, 2001,
for all former U S WEST management employees who did not have 20 years of
service by December 31, 2000, or who would not be
79
QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
service pension eligible by December 31, 2003. For employees who did not meet
these criteria, no additional years of service will be credited under the
defined lump sum formula for years worked after December 31, 2000. These
employee pension benefits will only be adjusted for changes in the employee
future compensation level. Future benefits will equal 3% of pay, plus a return
as defined in the Pension Plan. The minimum return an employee can earn on their
account in a given year is based upon the Treasury Rate and the employee
account balance at the beginning of the year. All management employees, other
than those who remain eligible under the previous formulas, will be eligible to
participate in the 3%-of-pay plan. The impact of these changes on the pension
credit for 2001 was an increase of approximately $10 million.
Effective August 11, 2000, the Pension Plan was amended to provide
additional pension benefits to plan participants who were involuntarily
separated from the Company as a result of the Merger between August 11, 2000,
and June 30, 2001. Under the restructuring plan, this amendment was extended to
cover additional employees who involuntarily separate from the Company. The
amount of the benefit is based on pay and years of service and ranges from a
minimum of four months up to a maximum of one year of an employee base pay.
For 2001 and 2000, the amounts of additional benefits paid were $154 million and
$27 million, respectively.
Pension and post-retirement costs are recognized over the period in which
the employee renders services and becomes eligible to receive benefits as
determined by using the projected unit credit method. Qwest funding policy is
to make contributions with the objective of accumulating sufficient assets to
pay all benefits when due. No pension funding was required in 2001, 2000 or
1999. The Company did not make any contributions to the post-retirement
healthcare benefit plan in 2001. In 2000 and 1999, Qwest made contributions to
the post-retirement healthcare benefit plan of $16 million and $18 million,
respectively.

To compute its expected return on pension plan assets, the Company applies
its expected rate of return to the market-related value of the pension plan
assets. The market-related asset value is a computed value that recognizes
changes in fair value of plan assets over a period of time, not to exceed five
years. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, the
Company elected to recognize actual returns on its plan assets ratably over a
five year period when computing its market-related value of plan assets. The
election was made in 1987 when SFAS No. 87 became effective. This method has the
effect of smoothing market volatility that may be experienced from year to year.
As a result, the Company expected return is not significantly impacted by the
actual return on plan assets experienced in the current year.

OTHER BENEFIT PLANS
401k plan. The Company currently sponsors two defined contribution
benefit plans covering substantially all management and occupational union
employees. Under these plans, employees may contribute a percentage of their
annual compensation to the plans up to certain maximums, as defined by the plans
and by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches a percentage of
employee contributions in Company stock. Expenses incurred in connection with
the Company 401k plans were $99 million, $113 million and $93 million for
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Deferred compensation plans. The Company sponsors several deferred
compensation plans for its current and former Boards of Directors and a select
group of management and highly compensated employees, certain of which are open
to new participants. Participants in these plans may, at their discretion,
invest their deferred compensation in various investment choices including
Company stock.
The deferred compensation obligation of the Company is recorded on the
balance sheet in Deferred Credits and Other. Company shares owned inside the
plans are treated as treasury stock and are recorded at cost in Stockholders'
Equity. Investment earnings, administrative expenses, changes in investment
values and increases or decreases in the deferred compensation liability
resulting from changes in the phantom investment values are recorded in the
Company income. The deferred compensation liability as of December 31, 2001

As of December 31, 2001, Qwest had a net operating loss carryforward of
$62 billion that will expire between 2003 and 2021. Unused net operating losses
generated by pre-Merger Qwest are subject to special rules in the Internal
Revenue Code IRC. IRC section 382 limits the amount of income that may be
offset each year by unused net operating losses arising prior to a merger. The
annual limitation is based upon the value of the acquired company at the time of
the merger times the federal long-term tax-exempt rate in effect at that date.
Any unused limitation may be carried forward and added to the next year
limitation. This limitation will not impact Qwest ability to utilize its net
operating losses against future taxable income. The Company believes it is more
likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to fully recover
the existing net deferred tax asset associated with the net operating loss
carryforward.
Prior to the purchase of the additional equity interest in KPNQwest in
November 2001, the Company investment in KPNQwest was deemed a foreign
corporate joint venture. As a result, Qwest previously did not record deferred
income taxes related to its investment in KPNQwest. The amount of unrecorded
deferred income taxes prior to the additional stock purchase was $305 million.
The temporary difference would become taxable upon the sale of KPNQwest or if
earnings were repatriated into the United States. With the purchase of the
additional 14 million shares of KPNQwest in November 2001, the Company
investment in KPNQwest is no longer considered a corporate joint venture.
Therefore, deferred taxes will be recognized prospectively on the Company
portion of all future undistributed earnings and losses of KPNQwest. Because the
current benefit will only become realizable upon the occurrence of the events
described above, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against these losses
of $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.
The Company had unamortized investment tax credits of $135 million and $154
million as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In addition, the Company
recorded a deferred tax asset associated with the exercise of employee stock
options of $204 million and $189 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively.

NOTE 9: STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Common stock $001 par value. In connection with the Merger, shares
outstanding have been adjusted to reflect the conversion rate of 172932 Qwest
shares for every U S WEST share.
Preferred stock. Under the Company charter, the Board of Directors has
the authority, without shareholder approval, to 1 create one or more classes
or series within a class of preferred stock, 2 issue shares of preferred stock
in such class or series up to the maximum number of shares of the relevant class
or series of preferred stock authorized, and 3 determine the preferences,
rights, privileges and restrictions of any such class or series, including the
dividend rights, voting rights, the rights and terms of redemption, the rights
and terms of conversion, liquidation preferences, the number of shares
constituting any such class or series and the designation of such class or
series. One of the effects of authorized but unissued and unreserved shares of
capital stock may be to render more difficult or discourage an attempt by a
potential acquirer to obtain control of the Company by means of a merger, tender
offer, proxy contest or otherwise, and thereby protect the continuity of the
Company management. The issuance of such shares of capital stock may have the
effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company
without any further action by the shareholders of the Company. The Company has
no present intention to adopt a shareholder rights plan, but could do so without
shareholder approval at any future time.
As of December 31, 2001, there were no shares of preferred stock issued and
outstanding.
Treasury stock. In January of 2001, Qwest repurchased 2222 million shares
of its common stock from BellSouth Corporation BellSouth for $10 billion in
cash. The repurchased shares were available to satisfy the Company obligations
under its employee benefits and options programs at December 31, 2001. As part
of the transaction, BellSouth committed to acquire $250 million in services from
the Company over a five-year period. The agreement provides that BellSouth will
make payment for the services in cash and/or Qwest common stock. The number of
shares tendered was based upon values contained in the agreement. During 2001,
Qwest provided services to BellSouth valued at $92 million. BellSouth paid for
these services by remitting cash throughout the year of $18 million and, on
December 10, 2001, tendering 12 million shares of Qwest common stock. The value
of the tendered shares at December 10, 2001 of $15 million was recorded in
treasury stock. The $43 million difference between i the value of the shares
at December 10, 2001 of $15 million and ii the value assigned to the shares
under the agreement of $58 million, was recorded as a reduction to additional
paid-in capital. The unpaid balance of $16 million was recorded in the Company
accounts receivable. See Note 15 for subsequent events.
Rabbi trusts established for two of the Company deferred compensation
plans include investments in the Company stock. These 504,000 shares with a
cost of $26 million at December 31, 2001, were accounted for as treasury stock.
Dividends. The Company declared dividends of $005, $031 and $136 per
share of common stock during 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Stock options. Prior to the Merger, U S WEST adopted stock plans under
which the Company could grant awards in the form of stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock and phantom units, as well as substitute
stock options and restricted stock awards. In connection with the Merger, all
outstanding options prior to the Merger announcement vested. Options granted
after that date and prior to June 30, 2000 continue to vest according to the
vesting requirements in the plan.
On June 23, 1997, Qwest adopted the Equity Incentive Plan, which was
amended and restated on June 1, 1998. This plan permits the grant of
non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, stock units and other stock grants. The maximum number of
shares of common stock that may be issued under the Equity Incentive Plan at any
time pursuant to awards is equal to 10% of the aggregate number of common shares
issued and outstanding. Issued and outstanding shares are determined as

of the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the preceding trading
day. As of December 31, 2001, the maximum number of options available for grant
was 166 million with 104 million options outstanding and 62 million options
available for grant. Approximately 104 million shares of common stock were
reserved for issuance at December 31, 2001.
The sub-committee of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
determines the exercise price for each option. However, stock options must have
an exercise price that is at least equal to the fair market value of the common
stock on the date the stock option is granted, subject to certain restrictions.
Stock option awards generally vest in equal increments over the vesting period
of the granted option either a four-or five-year period, and awards granted
under the Equity Incentive Plan will immediately vest upon any change in control
of the Company, as defined, unless provided otherwise by the Compensation
Committee at the time of grant. Options granted in 2001, 2000 and 1999 have
terms ranging from six to ten years.
On October 31, 2001, the Company announced a voluntary stock option
exchange offer. Under the terms of the offer and subject to certain
restrictions, Qwest employees could exchange all or a portion of their stock
options with an exercise price of $35 or more. The offer was available only to
Qwest full-time, non-union employees excluding 15 senior executives, for
options granted by Qwest or U S WEST. Options surrendered by an employee were
cancelled and new options will be issued no earlier than six months and one day
after the termination of the option exchange offer on a share-for-share basis.
The exercise price on the new options will equal the closing market price on the
day the new options are granted. The options will vest ratably over a four-year
period commencing on the new option grant date. At the expiration of the
exchange offer, 10,748 employees had exchanged stock options for approximately
29 million shares.

Employee stock purchase plan. In October 1998, pre-Merger Qwest the
acquired entity for accounting purposes instituted an Employee Stock Purchase
Plan ESPP. The Company is authorized to issue approximately 70 million
shares of Qwest common stock to eligible employees. Under the terms of the ESPP,
eligible employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 15% of their base
compensation, as defined, to purchase Qwest common stock at a price of 85% of
the fair market value of the Qwest common stock on the last trading day of the
month in which the Qwest common stock is purchased. Shares purchased prior to
the Merger were 253,766 in 2000 and 443,242 in 1999. Shares purchased subsequent
to the merger were 1,951,756 in 2001 and 349,868 in 2000.
Growth share plan. Pre-Merger Qwest the acquired entity for accounting
purposes had a Growth Share Plan for certain of its employees and directors. A
Growth Share was a unit of value based on the increase in value of Qwest over
a specified measurement period. Upon vesting, settlement of each Growth Share
was made in Qwest common stock. All Growth Share grants were made based on a
beginning Qwest value that was greater than or equal to the fair value of Qwest
at the grant date.
Prior to the Merger, Qwest recognized approximately $35 million and $6
million of expense for the Growth Share Plan in 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Subsequent to the Merger, the Company recognized $35 million of expense in 2000
and $12 million of expense in 2001 related to the Growth Share Plan.
The following table summarizes the activity of the number of shares of
Qwest common stock allocated for the settlement of outstanding Growth Shares                                NUMBER OF SHARES

were vested at December 31, 2000 and approximately $29 million was included in
other long-term liabilities related to outstanding Growth Shares. In the first
quarter of 2001, the Company issued approximately 357,000 shares of Qwest common
stock in settlement of all remaining vested Growth Shares.
NOTE 10: OPTICAL CAPACITY ASSET SALES AND PURCHASES
The Company sold optical capacity assets on its network to other
telecommunications services providers in the form of either sales of dark fiber
strands or sales of specific channels on Qwest lit network. These
arrangements are typically structured as indefeasible rights of use, or IRUs,
which are the exclusive right to use a specified amount of capacity or fiber for
a specified period of time, usually 20 years or more. Revenues from sales of
either type that meet the criteria of a sales-type lease were recognized at the
time of delivery to and acceptance by the customer. During the years ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized revenue of $1013 billion and
$468 million, respectively, related to optical capacity asset sales. Total
future cash payments to be received by the Company under these agreements are
$212 million in 2002 and $40 million in 2003.
The Company also entered into agreements to purchase optical capacity
assets and network facilities from other telecommunications services providers.
These purchases allow the Company to expand its fiber
88
QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
optic network both domestically and internationally. Property, plant and
equipment increased by approximately $988 million and $354 million during the
years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, due to these purchases. In
some cases, Qwest enters into two transactions that occur at the same time: one
to sell IRUs to companies and a second to acquire optical capacity from such
companies. These arrangements are referred to as contemporaneous transactions.
Although cash is generally exchanged in contemporaneous transactions and the
Company believes they are separate legally enforceable transactions, the Company
has also applied APB Opinion No. 29 and EITF Issue No. 01-02. Accordingly,
exchanges of optical capacity held for sale in the ordinary course of business
for capacity to be used in Qwest operations are recorded at fair value if the
criteria in these standards are met. Otherwise, these exchanges are recorded at
the lower of historical cost or fair value.

NOTE 11: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
COMMITMENTS
Minimum usage requirements and other commitments. Qwest has agreements
with IXCs and third party vendors that require the Company to maintain minimum
monthly and/or annual billings based on usage. The Company also has certain
agreements with third party vendors that require payments that are
unconditional. The minimum usage contracts primarily relate to IP and data
services such as dial-up Internet access, dedicated Internet access, voice over
IP services, traditional private lines, local access and asynchronous transfer
mode services. Qwest believes it will meet substantially all minimum usage
commitments. In the unlikely event that requirements have not been met, Qwest
will record the appropriate charges. The Company has reflected in its financial
statements the financial impact of all current, unmet minimum usage
requirements.
The Company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations to obtain
facilities management services from other telecommunications services companies.
Qwest is an authorized distributor for certain equipment manufacturers and
routinely sells such equipment to unrelated parties. During 2001, the Company
sold equipment to other telecommunications companies and contemporaneously
entered into unconditional
89
QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
commitments to obtain facilities management services from these companies. The
equipment sold to those companies will not be used exclusively to provide
services to Qwest and these companies may use alternative equipment or means to
provide the required facilities management services to the Company. Revenues
recognized from these equipment sales were $148 million during 2001 and none
during 2000. The profit from all these 2001 equipment sales was deferred because
there was no practical manner to separate the equipment sale and facilities
management services contracts. The deferred profit will be amortized over the
terms of the service agreements of approximately 4 to 5 years. Specifically,
under these facilities management services obligations, the Company minimum
future cash obligations are approximately $13 billion.
At December 31, 2001, the total amount of future cash commitments to be
paid over the next five years under minimum usage and unconditional purchase
requirement agreements is approximately $30 billion.
Letters of credit. The Company maintains letter of credit arrangements
with various financial institutions for up to $77 million. At December 31, 2001,
the amount of letters of credit outstanding was $49 million.
KPNQwest. As of December 31, 2001, Qwest had a remaining unconditional
purchase obligation to purchase up to E81 million or $72 million based on a
conversion rate at December 31, 2001 worth of network capacity from KPNQwest
through 2002. Qwest has no further obligation to fund KPNQwest.
CONTINGENCIES
Litigation. In April 1999, CSX Transportation, Inc. CSXT filed a
complaint in federal district court in Jacksonville, Florida against Qwest
seeking damages for an alleged breach of a 1995 contract. CSXT complaint
principally involves claims for alleged breaches of an agreement that granted
Qwest the right to install conduit for a fiber optic network along CSXT
rights-of-way. The Company has asserted counterclaims against CSXT alleging that
CSXT fraudulently induced a 1999 settlement agreement regarding defense and
indemnity obligations between the parties, and alleging that CSXT breached the
1995 agreement. Trial is scheduled to commence in May 2002.
In January 2001, an amended purported class action complaint was filed in
Denver District Court against Qwest and certain current and former officers and
directors on behalf of stockholders of U S WEST. The complaint alleges that
Qwest has a duty to pay a quarterly dividend to U S WEST stockholders of record
as of June 30, 2000. Plaintiffs further claim that the defendants attempted to
avoid paying the dividend by changing the record date from June 30, 2000 to July
10, 2000. In June 2000, the court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary
restraining order attempting to prevent the closing of the Merger. In October
2001, Qwest motion to dismiss the complaint was denied in part. The court
deferred ruling on the remainder of the motion pending discovery.
On July 23, 2001, Qwest filed a demand for arbitration against Citizens
alleging that it breached Agreements for Purchase and Sale of Telephone
Exchanges dated as of June 16, 1999, between Citizens and U S WEST
Communications, Inc., with respect to the purchase and sale of exchanges in
Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska and Wyoming. The
demand for arbitration was filed after Citizens failed to close the exchange
sales in violation of the terms of the purchase agreements. Citizens, in turn,
filed a demand for arbitration alleging counter claims against Qwest in
connection with the sale of those same exchanges, as well as exchanges located
in North Dakota that Qwest did sell to Citizens. In the arbitration, Qwest seeks
a determination that Citizens breached the agreements and, as a result, Qwest is
entitled to draw down on a series of letters of credit Citizens provided in
connection with the transactions and other damages. Citizens seeks a
determination that Qwest breached the agreements and, as a result, Citizens is
entitled to damages. This arbitration is still at a preliminary stage.
In August 2001, Qwest filed a complaint in state court in Colorado and an
arbitration demand against Touch America, Inc. Touch America. In response,
also in August 2001, Touch America filed a complaint against Qwest in federal
district court in Montana and removed Qwest state court complaint to federal
90
QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
district court in Colorado. Touch America has also filed answers and
counterclaims in the arbitration and the Colorado lawsuit. Touch America
complaint in Montana was dismissed on November 5, 2001, and Touch America
motion for reconsideration was denied on December 17, 2001. The disputes between
Qwest and Touch America relate to various billing, reimbursement and other
commercial disputes arising under agreements entered into for the sale of
Qwest interLATA local access and transport area business in its local
service area to Touch America on June 30, 2000. Touch America also asserts that
Qwest has violated state and federal antitrust laws, the Telecommunications Act
of 1996 the Act and Qwest Federal Communications Commission tariff. Each
party seeks damages against the other for amounts billed and unpaid and for
other disputes. Discovery has begun in the arbitration, and the parties have
tentatively scheduled the arbitration hearing for September 23, 2002. The court
case is in a preliminary stage, discovery has not begun and no trial date has
been set. Touch America also asserts that we violated the Act including claims
relating to Qwest sale of IRUs violating the Act and its tariffs, and has
filed related complaints at the FCC.
From July 27, 2001 to October 1, 2001, seven purported class action
complaints were filed in federal district court in Colorado against Qwest, its
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph P. Nacchio, and its Chief Financial
Officer, Robin R. Szeliga on behalf of purchasers of Qwest publicly traded
stock between March 22, 2001 and July 23, 2001. One of the seven complaints has
been voluntarily dismissed. The remaining six complaints, which have been
consolidated, allege, among other things, that Qwest, Mr. Nacchio and Ms.
Szeliga made material false statements regarding the results of operations for
the quarter ended March 31, 2001 in violation of sections 10b and 20a of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act and that, during the above
period, the individual defendants sold shares of Qwest common stock. On
December 3, 2001, a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint Consolidated
Complaint was filed in federal district court in Colorado against Qwest,
Joseph P. Nacchio, Robin R. Szeliga, and several other former and present
officers and/or directors of the Company on behalf of purchasers of Qwest
publicly traded stock between October 24, 2000 and October 30, 2001. This
Consolidated Complaint supersedes the six purported class action complaints
filed between July 27, 2001 and October 1, 2001. The Consolidated Complaint
alleges, among other things, that during the class period, Qwest and certain of
the individual defendants made material false statements regarding the results
of operations in violation of sections 10b and 20a of the Exchange Act and
that during the class period, the individual defendants sold shares of Qwest
common stock in violation of section 20A of the Exchange Act. The Consolidated
Complaint alleges that Qwest financial results during the class period and
statements regarding those results were false and misleading due to the alleged
i overstatement of revenue, ii understatement of costs, iii manipulation
of employee benefits in order to increase profitability, and iv misstatement
of certain assets and liabilities. The Consolidated Complaint seeks unspecified
compensatory damages and other relief. On January 15, 2002, Qwest and the
individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which is pending before the
court.
On October 22, 2001, a derivative lawsuit was filed in federal district
court in Colorado, naming as defendants each of the members of the Qwest Board
of Directors, and naming Qwest as a nominal defendant. The derivative complaint
is based upon the allegations made in the class actions described in the
preceding paragraph, and alleges that the Board members intentionally or
negligently breached their fiduciary duties to Qwest by failing to oversee
implementation of securities laws that prohibit insider trading. The derivative
complaint also alleges that the Board members breached their fiduciary duties to
Qwest by causing or permitting Qwest to commit alleged securities violations,
thus i causing Qwest to be sued for such violations, and ii subjecting Qwest
to adverse publicity, increasing Qwest cost of raising capital and impairing
earnings. The derivative complaint further alleges that certain directors sold
shares between April 26, 2001 and May 15, 2001 using non-public company
information. In December 2001, the derivative lawsuit was stayed, pending
resolution of the Consolidated Complaint. See Note 15 for subsequent events.
From time to time the Company receives complaints and becomes subject to
investigations regarding slamming the practice of changing long-distance
carriers without the customer consent, cramming
91
QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
the practice of charging a consumer for goods or services that the consumer has
not authorized or ordered, and other matters. In December 2001, an
administrative law judge recommended to the California Public Utilities
Commission that Qwest be assessed a $38 million penalty for alleged slamming and
cramming violations. That recommendation was appealed by Qwest to the full
California Public Utilities Commission on January 4, 2002 and the Company is
awaiting the decision on appeal. The Company has received other complaints
regarding slamming and cramming, both in and outside its local service area, and
may become subject to other investigations in the future. Such complaints or
investigations have resulted or could result in further legal action and the
imposition of fines and other penalties or damage awards. Although such
complaints and actions are not anticipated to have a material adverse effect on
the Company, they could indirectly impact the timing of the Company Section
271 approval to sell long-distance services in the Company local service area.
Through December 2001, several purported class actions have been filed in
various courts against Qwest on behalf of landowners in Alabama, California,
Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri,
North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. The complaints
challenge Qwest right to install its fiber optic cable network in railroad
rights-of-way and in California, Colorado, Illinois, South Carolina and Texas,
also challenge the Company right to install fiber optic cable in utility and
pipeline rights-of-way. In Alabama, the complaint challenges Qwest right to
install fiber optic cable in any right-of-way, including public highways. The
complaints allege that the railroads, utilities and pipeline companies own a
limited property right-of-way that did not include the right to permit the
Company to install its fiber optic cable network on the plaintiffs' property.
The Indiana action purports to be on behalf of a national class of landowners
adjacent to railroad rights-of-way over which the Company network passes. The
Alabama, California, Colorado, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Missouri, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas actions
purport to be on behalf of a class of such landowners in those states,
respectively. The Illinois action purports to be on behalf of landowners
adjacent to railroad rights-of-way over which Qwest network passes in
Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio and Wisconsin. The
complaints seek damages on theories of trespass and unjust enrichment, as well
as punitive damages.
Qwest has also been named as a defendant in various other litigation
matters. The Company intends to vigorously defend these outstanding claims and
the outstanding claims specifically described above.
Intellectual property. Qwest frequently receives offers to take licenses
for patent and other intellectual rights, including rights held by competitors
in the telecommunications industry, in exchange for royalties or other
substantial consideration. Qwest also regularly is the subject of allegations
that its products or services infringe upon various intellectual property
rights, and receives demands that it discontinue the alleged infringement. The
Company normally investigates such offers and allegations and responds
appropriately, including defending itself vigorously when appropriate. There can
be no assurance that, if one or more of these allegations proved to have merit
and involved significant rights, damages or royalties, this would not have a
material adverse effect on Qwest.
Regulatory matters. Qwest has pending regulatory actions in local
regulatory jurisdictions which call for price decreases, refunds or both. These
actions are generally routine and incidental to Qwest business.
The Company has provided for certain of the above matters in its
consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2001. Although the ultimate
resolution of these claims is uncertain, Qwest does not expect any material
adverse impacts as a result of the resolution of these matters.
NOTE 12: SEGMENT INFORMATION
Qwest operates in four segments: retail services, wholesale services,
network services and directory services. The retail services segment provides
local telephone and data services, long-distance voice and data
92
QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
services and wireless services. The wholesale services segment provides exchange
access services that connect customers to the facilities of IXCs and
interconnection to the Qwest telecommunications network to CLECs. The network
services segment provides access to the Qwest telecommunications network,
including Qwest information technologies, primarily to the Company retail
services and wholesale services segments. The directory services segment
publishes White and Yellow Pages telephone directories and provide Internet-
based directory services and database marketing services. Qwest provides its
services to residential and business customers both inside and outside its local
service area.
Following is a breakout of the Company segments. The accounting
principles used are the same as those used in the consolidated financial
statements. The other category includes unallocated corporate expenses and
revenues. Qwest internally tracks, separately, only the assets of its Directory
Services segment with all remaining assets included as a reconciling item. The
Reconciling Items category also includes other adjustments. The 1999 amounts
have not been restated to conform with the 2001 and 2000 presentation because
the information was not available as a result of systems changes that occurred
after the Merger.                                  TOTAL

performance. The Company believes that adjusted EBITDA is important to
investors in the Company debt and equity securities and to analysts that
cover these securities because it is one measure of the income generated
that is available to service debt. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent cash
flow for the periods presented and should not be considered as an
alternative to cash flows as a source of liquidity. Moreover, the items
excluded from the calculation of adjusted EBITDA are significant components
in understanding and assessing the Company financial performance. Qwest
definition of adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable with EBITDA or
adjusted EBITDA as used by other companies or with similar concepts used in
Qwest debt instruments. Adjusted EBITDA is reported as a complement to the
financial results in accordance with GAAP and is presented to provide
investors additional information concerning the Company operations.

will be: 1 business services, 2 consumer services, 3 wholesale services,
4 directory services and 5 network services. The business services segment
provides IP, data, voice and wireless products and services to retail and small
business customers. The consumer services segment provides IP, data, voice and
wireless products and services to the consumer market. The wholesale services
segment provides exchange access services that connect customers to the
facilities of IXCs and interconnection to the Qwest telecommunications network
to CLECs as well as IP, data, voice and wireless products and services to
wholesale customers. The network and directory services segments will remain the
same as under the previous segment reporting.
NOTE 13: RESTRUCTURING
During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company approved a plan to further
reduce current employee levels, consolidate and sublease facilities and abandon
certain capital projects, terminate certain operating leases and recognize
certain asset impairments. The Company recorded a restructuring charge of $749
million to cover the costs associated with these actions. The restructuring
charge is comprised of the following                                   YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 2001
DOLLARS IN MILLIONS
Severance and employee-related charges.      $332

Contractual settlements and legal contingencies.      129
Other       123
Total restructuring       $749
In order to streamline the business and consolidate operations to meet
lower customer demand resulting from the current economic conditions, the
Company identified a net reduction of 11,000 employees and contractors in
various functional areas, in addition to previous reductions in connection with
the Merger. The severance charge of $332 million relates to involuntary
separation costs for approximately 10,000 employees. The Company expects the
remainder of the reduction to be achieved through attrition. As of December 31,
2001, over 4,000 employees had been involuntarily separated by the Company and
cash severance payments totaling $32 million had been made relating to these
separations. The Company expects the remaining employee separations to be
completed by June 30, 2002.
The Company operates 16 Web hosting centers CyberCenters across the
country that are subject to various operating leases. Qwest also has several
CyberCenters currently under construction that would require
94
QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
additional capital outlays before they are functional. Finally, the Company has
some CyberCenter facilities under lease where no construction work has begun. As
a result of the slowing economy and current excess capacity for Web hosting
services, the Company has suspended its plans to build CyberCenters where
construction had not begun and has halted further construction on those
currently under construction. The Company expects to sublease the majority of
the non-operational CyberCenters within the next 12 months at rates less than
Qwest lease rates for the facilities. The Company recorded a charge of $112
million for expected sublease losses. In addition, the Company wrote off $53
million of leasehold improvements at CyberCenters that were partially complete.
The Company occupies administrative and network operations buildings under
operating leases with varying terms. Due to the reduction in employees and
consolidation of operations, the Company expects to terminate 40 operating lease
agreements across the country within the next 12 months. The Company recorded a
charge of $129 million related to the termination of these operating lease
agreements.
Other restructuring charges primarily includes asset impairments. Asset
impairment charges of $51 million relate mainly to the assets of two development
projects. Because both projects were incomplete and abandoned, the fair value of
such assets was determined to be zero. These assets were operated by the
Company network services segment and represented certain equipment and other
assets. The Company also reviewed all internal software projects in process and
determined that certain projects with a carrying value of $68 million would no
longer be pursued. Because the projects were incomplete and abandoned, the fair
value of such software was determined to be zero. The abandoned projects
included various billing and other system enhancements.
A summary of the liabilities recorded from these restructuring costs at
December 31, 2001, is as follows                       JANUARY 1,               DECEMBER 31,

NOTE 14: RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
During 2001 and 2000, Qwest entered into several transactions in the normal
course of business with KPNQwest for the purchase and sale of optical capacity
assets and the provisioning of services such as private line, Web hosting,
Internet protocol transit and dedicated Internet access. The Company made
purchases from KPNQwest of approximately $213 million and $70 million in 2001
and 2000, respectively. Qwest sold products and services to KPNQwest in the
amount of $18 million and $26 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. At
December 31, 2001 and 2000, Qwest had a receivable from KPNQwest for these
products and services of $8 million and $7 million, respectively. Pricing for
these services was based on what the Company believed to be fair market value at
the time the transactions were consummated. The sales to Qwest were in
accordance with the distribution agreement Qwest has with KPNQwest, whereby
Qwest is, in certain circumstances, the exclusive distributor of certain of
KPNQwest services in North America. Qwest owns approximately 475% of the
outstanding shares of KPNQwest common stock. As of December 31, 2001                     95
QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Qwest had a remaining unconditional purchase obligation to purchase up to E81
million or $72 million based on a conversion rate at December 31, 2001 worth
of network capacity from KPNQwest through 2002. Qwest has no further obligation
to fund KPNQwest.
In October 1999, Qwest and ADMI, an affiliate of Anschutz Company, formed a
joint venture called QDM that provided advanced digital production,
post-production and transmission facilities, digital media storage and
distribution services, telephony-based data storage and enhanced services,
access and routing services. Qwest contributed approximately $848 million in
the form of a promissory note payable over nine years at an annual interest rate
of 6%. At inception, Qwest and ADMI each owned a 50% equity and voting interest
in the joint venture. In June 2000, Qwest acquired an additional 25% interest in
QDM directly from ADMI. Qwest paid approximately $482 million for the interest;
approximately $48 million was paid in cash at closing and the remaining $434
million was paid with approximately $18 million in interest, on January 2,
2001. Following this transaction, Qwest owned a 75% economic interest and 50%
voting interest in QDM and ADMI owned a 25% economic interest and a 50% voting
interest.
In October 1999, Qwest also agreed to purchase certain telephony-related
assets and all of the stock of Precision Systems, Inc., a telecommunications
solutions provider, from ADMI in exchange for a promissory note in the amount of
approximately $34 million. The note bears interest at 6% annually with
semi-annual interest payments and annual principal payments due through 2008.
In October 1999, Qwest entered into a long-term Master Services Agreement
the MSA with QDM under which QDM agreed to purchase approximately $119
million of telecommunication services through October 2008 and Qwest agreed to
extend credit to QDM for the purpose of making payments for the
telecommunication services. Each October, QDM would be required to pay Qwest an
amount equal to the difference between certain specified annual commitment
levels and the amount of services actually purchased under the MSA at that time.
In October 2001, Qwest agreed to release QDM from its obligation to acquire
telecommunications services from Qwest in exchange for QDM forgiving Qwest
$848 million promissory note after giving effect to a payment by Qwest of $25
million in accrued interest and $13 million in principal on the note. Prior to
termination of the MSA, Qwest advanced QDM the amount QDM owed for accrued
telecommunications services of $38 million and QDM applied the advance to pay
Qwest the amount owing for the services, including interest on amounts past due.
Concurrently with terminating the MSA, QDM repaid the $38 million advance under
the MSA.
During 2001, Qwest recorded a charge of $15 million that represented its
share of an impairment charge recorded by QDM. In December 2001, Qwest
management made a decision to discontinue funding QDM, resulting in a charge of
$18 million. In February 2002, a determination was made to discontinue the QDM
business.
NOTE 15: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
BELLSOUTH STOCK TRANSACTIONS
Qwest entered into an agreement with BellSouth in 2001 under which
BellSouth committed to acquire services from Qwest over a five-year period the
2001 Agreement. The 2001 Agreement provided that BellSouth may make payment
for the services in Qwest common stock based upon values contained in the
agreement. During the first quarter 2002, the Company received approximately
278,000 shares of Qwest common stock valued at $13 million from BellSouth in
partial satisfaction of the outstanding $16 million accounts receivable
outstanding at December 31, 2001. In addition, in accordance with the 2001
agreement, Qwest used $12 million of the $18 million in cash paid by BellSouth
affiliates for services in 2001 to purchase approximately 253,000 shares of
Qwest common stock at the value assigned to the shares under the 2001 Agreement.
The 2001 Agreement was cancelled as of January 16, 2002, having the effect of
eliminating the remaining commitment to purchase services and the ability to use
Qwest common stock to pay for such
96
QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
services. At that time, BellSouth committed to purchase from Qwest $350 million
in services over four years payable in cash. In consideration for terminating
the 2001 agreement, Qwest gave BellSouth a non-cash credit of $71 million that
will be reflected on the balance sheet as a deposit from BellSouth. The deposit
is expected to offset payments due from BellSouth as Qwest provides services to
BellSouth in the future.
BORROWINGS, COMMITMENTS AND OTHER DEBT-RELATED MATTERS
Until February 2002, Qwest maintained commercial paper programs to finance
short-term operating cash needs of the business. As of December 31, 2001, the
Company had a $40 billion syndicated credit facility available to support its
commercial paper programs. There was no balance outstanding on the syndicated
credit facility at December 31, 2001. The syndicated credit facility matures on
May 3, 2002. Qwest could have converted any borrowed amount into a one-year term
loan that would be due in May 2003 provided Qwest was not in default under the
credit facility, including compliance with all covenants. The most restrictive
financial covenant in the syndicated credit facility at December 31, 2001
required the Company to maintain a debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA ratio of no more
than 375-to-1. Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the credit facility is a
measure of EBITDA that starts with the Company net income and adds back
certain items, primarily those of a non-cash or a non-operating nature. This
syndicated credit facility contains a provision that would allow acceleration of
the full amount due upon a default in payment obligations aggregating in excess
of $100 million under debt obligations having an aggregate principal amount in
excess of $100 million, including any of the Post-Merger public debt and
Pre-Merger public debt.
As a result of reduced demand for its commercial paper, Qwest borrowed the
full amount under this facility in February 2002 and used most of the proceeds
to repay commercial paper. After repaying the commercial paper, Qwest had
approximately $800 million of proceeds remaining that the Company expects will
be used to pay current maturities under short-term notes, long-term borrowings
and capital lease obligations. At December 31, 2001, the Company had
approximately $16 billion in short-term notes, long-term borrowings and capital
lease obligations maturing over the next 12 months. As a result, Qwest overall
borrowings, net of the excess unapplied cash, remained unchanged at
approximately $250 billion after applying the proceeds of the borrowings under
the credit facility. In March 2002, Qwest amended the syndicated credit facility
and currently expects to convert the balance of the facility as of May 3, 2002
into a one-year term loan that would be due May 2003. As part of the amendment,
the Company i increased the maximum debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA ratio from
375-to-1 to 425-to-1 through the quarter ended September 30, 2002, decreasing
to 40-to-1 beginning December 31, 2002, and ii agreed to use a portion of net
proceeds from future sales of assets and capital market transactions, including
the issuance of debt and equity securities, to prepay the bank loan until the
outstanding loan is $20 billion or less. As a result, Qwest overall
borrowings, net of the excess unapplied cash, remained unchanged.
The amount drawn down under the $4 billion syndicated bank facility was
initially distributed between two wholly-owned subsidiaries of Qwest, Qwest
Capital Funding , Inc. QCF and Qwest Corporation, with $3 billion assigned
to QCF and $1 billion assigned to Qwest Corporation. Following the amendment of
the syndicated credit facility agreement, Qwest paid $608 million of the
proceeds from Qwest Corporation March 2002 bond offering discussed below to
reduce the total amount outstanding and, as permitted under the agreement,
re-distributed the amounts outstanding between QCF and Qwest Corporation. As of
March 31, 2002, the syndicated credit facility had the total amount outstanding
of $339 billion assigned to QCF and nothing assigned to Qwest Corporation.
In March 2002, the Company paid the full amount necessary to acquire all
properties subject to its synthetic lease agreements and terminated these
agreements. The purchase price of all such properties was approximately $255
million. As a result of the purchase, the loan commitments totaling $382 million
were terminated and the Company is no longer liable for its residual value
guarantees of up to $228 million that were only applicable if the leases expired
at the end of their term.
97
QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
In March 2002, Qwest Corporation issued $15 billion in bonds with a
ten-year maturity and an 8875% interest rate. Approximately $608 million of the
net proceeds were used to repay a portion of the Qwest Corporation borrowings
under the syndicated credit facility. The remaining proceeds from the sale of
the bonds will be used to repay short-term obligations and currently maturing
long-term borrowings. As a result, Qwest net debt outstanding, net of excess
unapplied cash, remained substantially unchanged after applying the proceeds
from the bond issuance.
In February and March 2002, the credit ratings for Qwest and QCF were
lowered one level to BBB by Fitch Ratings Fitch and Standard and Poor
S and two levels to Baa3 by Moody Investor Service Moody. The
ratings for Qwest Corporation were lowered two levels to BBB+ by Fitch, one
level to BBB by S and two levels to Baa2 by Moody. These ratings are
investment grade. The commercial paper ratings for Qwest, Qwest Corporation and
QCF were also lowered to F-3, P-3 and A-3 by Fitch, Moody and S,
respectively.
During 2002, Qwest repurchased through direct exchange transactions
approximately $97 million in face amount of debt issued by and guaranteed by
Qwest. In exchange for the debt, Qwest issued approximately 99 million shares
of its common stock out of treasury.
CONTINGENCY MATTERS
On February 14, 2002, the Minnesota Department of Commerce filed a formal
complaint against Qwest with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission alleging
that Qwest, in contravention of federal and state law, failed to file
interconnection agreements with the Minnesota PUC relating to certain of its
wholesale customers, and thereby allegedly discriminating against other CLECs.
The complaint seeks civil penalties related to such alleged violations between
$50 million and $200 million. This proceeding is at an early stage. Other states
in the local service area are looking into similar matters and further
proceedings may ensue in those states.
On February 19 and February 25, 2002, two purported class action complaints
were filed in federal district court in Colorado against Qwest, Joseph P.
Nacchio and Robin R. Szeliga. These complaints purport to be filed on behalf of
purchasers of Qwest publicly traded stock between April 19, 2000 and February
13, 2002. The complaints allege, among other things, that during the class
period, Qwest and the individual defendants made material false statements
regarding the results of operations in violation of sections 10b and 20a of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act and that Qwest
financial results during the class period and statements regarding those results
were false and misleading due to the alleged failure to disclose four
transactions between Qwest and KMC Telecom Holdings, Inc. KMC. The
complaints seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. On February
27, 2002, lead plaintiffs in the consolidated securities action, which is
described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, moved to
consolidate these complaints with the consolidated securities action.
On March 13, 2002, a purported class action complaint was filed in federal
district court in Colorado on behalf of purchasers of Qwest publicly traded
stock between April 19, 2000 and February 13, 2002. In addition to the
defendants named in the actions filed on February 19, 2002 and February 25,
2002, this complaint names as defendants Afshin Mohebbi and Robert S. Woodruff.
The complaint alleges generally the same facts as the two purported class
actions filed on February 19 and 25, 2002, and like those actions, alleges that
during the class period, Qwest and the individual defendants made material false
statements regarding the results of operations in violation of sections 10b
and 20a of the Exchange Act and that Qwest financial results during the
class period and statements regarding those results were false and misleading
due to the alleged failure to disclose four transactions between Qwest and KMC.
In addition, the complaint alleges that Qwest financial results were
misleading because of the alleged failure to disclose unspecified transactions
with Calpoint LLC Calpoint that were similar in nature to the transactions
alleged involving KMC. The
98
QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
complaint also alleges that Messrs. Nacchio and Woodruff and Ms. Szeliga sold
shares of Qwest common stock in violation of section 10b of the Exchange
Act.
In March 2002, lead plaintiffs in the consolidated securities action filed
a motion for leave to file a Second Amended Consolidated Complaint that seeks
to: add new claims; extend the putative class period so that it begins on April
19, 2000 and ends on February 14, 2002; and add Lewis O. Wilks, a former Qwest
officer, and others as defendants. In March 2002, the defendants filed
oppositions to plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a Second Amended
Consolidated Complaint. The court has not ruled on the motion.
In March 2002, three putative class action suits were filed in federal
district court in Colorado on behalf of all participants and beneficiaries of
the Qwest Savings and Investment Plan the Plan since March 7, 1999, and name
as defendants Qwest, Qwest directors and the administrators and directors of
the Plan. The suits, which are brought under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act ERISA and seek restitution and other relief, allege that the
defendants breached fiduciary duties to the Plan members due to the percentage
of the investment of the Plan assets in Qwest stock and purportedly failing to
provide accurate information about the Company financial condition and the
risks associated with investing in Qwest stock. No other action has taken
place with respect to these suits.
In March 2002, plaintiffs in the derivative lawsuit described in Note 11
served defendants with a first amended derivative complaint. The amended
derivative complaint adds allegations relating to the disclosures of Qwest
financial results from April 2000 through February 2002.
The Company has provided for certain of the above matters in its
consolidated financial statements. Although the ultimate resolution of these
claims is uncertain, Qwest does not expect any material adverse impacts as a
result of the resolution of these matters.
SEC INQUIRY
On March 8, 2002, the Company received a request from the Denver regional
office of the SEC to voluntarily participate in an informal inquiry into certain
of its accounting practices. The accounting practices include accounting for
contemporaneous transactions in which the Company may have sold an optical
capacity asset to a counter-party at or about the same time it acquired capacity
from the counter-party, sales of equipment to counter-parties from which the
Company will acquire facilities management services and directory publication
revenues. The Company intends to cooperate fully with the SEC inquiry.
Contemporaneous capacity transactions. The Company enters into
transactions with communication service providers under which they sell optical
capacity to these providers. At or about the same time Qwest enters into these
transactions, the Company may commit to acquire optical capacity from these
customers.
The agreements for the sale of the capacity are separate legal agreements
that are enforceable regardless of performance under the purchase contract. It
is the Company policy that prior to recognizing revenue on these sales
transactions, the Company obtains acceptance of the delivered route from the
buyer and generally receives all or a significant portion at least 25% of the
sales proceeds in cash. The Company has the ability to retain the cash received
regardless of the buyer performance under the purchase contract. As such, the
Company believes these are legally enforceable, cash transactions. In addition,
the Company generally applies the more restrictive requirement of APB Opinion
No. 29 to these contemporaneous transactions. APB Opinion No. 29, as affirmed by
EITF Issue No. 01-02, sets forth guidance that an exchange of a product or
property held for sale in the ordinary course of business for a productive asset
not held for sale in the ordinary course of business does not fall within the
modifications to the basic principle of Opinion 29 even if they are in the same
line of business and should be recorded at fair value. Therefore, the Company
recognizes revenue for the fair value of these optical capacity asset sales, and
records the fair value of the optical capacity assets acquired in property,
plant and equipment.
99
QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Beginning with its IPO in 1997, Qwest has consistently disclosed that a
substantial portion of its fiber optic network is being constructed for sale in
the ordinary course of business. Qwest has only recognized revenue for the
exchange of optical capacity held for sale in the ordinary course of business
for optical capacity it will need to provide voice, data and video
transportation services in the future.
In 1999, Qwest announced that it was committed to build or acquire a
worldwide network. To implement this strategy, the Company formed KPNQwest, a
joint venture with KPN, to build a Pan-European network. Concurrently, Qwest
began acquiring capacity from different entities to develop its Asian, South
American and Latin American networks. Prior to the acquisition of this capacity,
Qwest had no owned or leased capacity in these markets. The acquisition of the
capacity in the above contemporaneous transactions was the implementation of
this strategy. In total, Qwest acquired approximately $591 million in
international capacity from these telecommunications providers in lieu of
constructing similar capacity. The acquired capacity is in various stages of
utilization. Certain acquired capacity that has been put into operation and
utilization thus far has ranged up to one-third of the acquired capacity. Other
capacity has not yet been put into operation because the Company has not yet
received a telecommunications license in the target markets or because a
significant customer base has not yet developed in those markets. The Company
intends to put into operation all capacity acquired in these contemporaneous
transactions.
The Company also purchased $397 million of domestic dark fiber and other
related equipment and services. The acquired dark fiber routes are routes that
Qwest had not constructed when designing its own global fiber optic broadband
network and metropolitan area network fiber rings or routes needed for
restoration purposes. At the time the dark fiber was acquired, Qwest had formal
and informal commitments from various significant customers to carry traffic
along those acquired routes.
APB Opinion No. 29 provides the accounting for a nonmonetary transaction
should not be based on the fair values of the assets transferred unless those
fair values are determinable within reasonable limits. The guidance in APB
Opinion No. 29 for determining fair value includes reference to estimated
realizable values in cash transactions of the same or similar assets, quoted
market prices, independent appraisals, estimated fair values of assets or
services received in exchange, and other available evidence. Further, if one of
the parties in a nonmonetary transaction could have elected to receive cash
instead of the nonmonetary asset, the amount of cash that could have been
received may be evidence of the fair value of the nonmonetary assets exchanged.
The Company believes it had an enforceable right to receive cash for the
sales transaction independent of the purchase transaction and this is the best
evidence of fair value. Regardless, Qwest had entered into numerous cash
transactions for the same or similar optical capacity in 2000 and 2001.
Although the Company believes the accounting criteria used is consistent
with the accounting criteria specified for the sale or exchange of optical
capacity, there is no certainty that the SEC will agree with the Company
application of these criteria to specific transactions. The amount of revenue
and gross margin attributable to all optical capacity asset sales in 2001 and
2000 is as follows: 1 revenues of $1013 billion, or 51% of total revenue, in
2001 and $468 million, or 28% of total revenue, in 2000 and 2 gross margin of
$486 million, which is 66% of adjusted EBITDA in 2001, and $232 million, which
is 34% of adjusted EBITDA in 2000. On an after-tax basis, the gross margin of
all optical capacity asset sales was approximately $290 million and $140 million
in 2001 and 2000, respectively. These amounts would be partially offset by the
amounts that may be recognized over the lives of the agreements if these optical
capacity asset sales had instead been treated as operating leases.
Equipment sales. The Company is an authorized distributor of, and
periodically sells, certain telecommunications equipment. In certain of those
transactions, the Company has also contracted to acquire facilities management
services from the purchaser. These services are in markets where the Company did
not have owned facilities and its decision to acquire these services was based
upon a buy-versus-build analysis. These

services were needed to build out the Company Internet platforms and to
facilitate its entry into the managed wavelength services market. The term of
the facilities management agreements are generally five years.
KMC Telecom Holdings, Inc. Qwest has sold equipment to KMC, which is an
established CLEC with a diverse customer base. KMC could have procured the
equipment directly from the manufacturers or from other distributors using
various financing alternatives available to them. At the time of the sales,
title to the equipment and substantially all risks and rewards of ownership
such as technological and economic obsolescence, physical damage and
performance risk related to the equipment passed to KMC. Subsequent to the
Merger and during 2001, Qwest sold equipment to KMC for $148 million in cash.
At or about the same times as equipment sales to KMC, Qwest entered into an
unconditional commitment to purchase facilities management services from KMC.
KMC is responsible for providing the services required under the facilities
management agreement in whatever way it deems appropriate and has the economic
risk associated with the cost of providing those services. Further, KMC must
meet the service level commitments under the facilities management agreement.
Conversely, the agreement does not convey to Qwest the right to use specific
assets of KMC nor does it limit KMC ability to use any of its equipment or
network to serve its remaining customers. The cost of the facilities management
services was comparable to similar services either acquired by Qwest from other
providers or charged by Qwest to its customers. This commitment is included in
unconditional purchase obligations disclosed in Note 11. Because there was no
practical manner by which to separate the terms of the equipment sales and
facilities management services contracts, the profit from the equipment sales
was deferred. The deferred profit will be amortized ratably over the terms of
the service agreements of approximately 4-5 years.
Calpoint LLC. During 2001, Qwest contracted to sell equipment to Calpoint
in exchange for total cash consideration of approximately $300 million. At the
time of the transaction, Qwest was not an authorized distributor of the
equipment sold to Calpoint. However, because of its buying-power, Qwest was able
to obtain a significant discount from the manufacturer acting on behalf of
Calpoint. Because Qwest acted as an agent rather than a principal in this
transaction, the proceeds received from Calpoint in excess of the purchase price
of the equipment were deferred and no revenues were recognized on the sales
transaction.
Qwest has entered into an unconditional commitment to purchase facilities
management services from Calpoint. Calpoint is responsible for providing the
services required under the facilities management agreement in whatever way it
deems appropriate and has the economic risk associated with the cost of
providing those services. The agreement does not convey to Qwest the right to
use specific assets of Calpoint nor does it limit Calpoint ability to use any
of its equipment or network to serve its remaining customers. This commitment is
included in unconditional purchase obligations disclosed in Note 11.
Although there can be no assurance that the SEC will agree with the
Company application of generally accepted accounting principles, Qwest
believes it has appropriately reported and disclosed these transactions with KMC
and Calpoint.
Directory publishing revenues. Effective January 1999, Dex changed its
method of recognizing directory publishing revenue to the point of publication
method. Under the point of publication method of accounting, revenues are
recognized when the directories are published. The amount of revenue recognized
upon publication of a directory depends on the service life of that directory.
The lives of Qwest directories generally vary between 11 to 13 months.
In 2000, the Company shortened the service life of one of its directories
to 11 months, resulting in the directory being published in both January and
December of 2000. This resulted in the Company recording an additional $28
million of revenue in 2000 relating to this directory.
101
QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
In 2001, the Company extended to 13 months or shortened to 11 months the
service lives of certain of its directories, resulting in 2001 revenues being
$42 million higher than if the service lives of the directories had not been
extended or shortened.
The Company considers various factors in establishing the timing and length
of its directories. These factors include financial considerations, the cost of
printing the directory, timing of the sales-effort or canvas to sell advertising
in the directories, expected price increases and the desire of its customers.
Although there can be no assurance that the SEC will agree with the
Company application of generally accepted accounting principles, Qwest
believes it has appropriately reported its directory revenues.
