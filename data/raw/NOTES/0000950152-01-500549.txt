REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors
and Shareholders
of Dominion Homes, Inc.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of operations, of shareholders' equity and of
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Dominion Homes, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.    BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION     Dominion Homes, Inc. is a single-family homebuilder with operations in
Central Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky. The Company was incorporated in October
1993 in anticipation of its initial public offering of common shares in March
1994. Prior to the initial public offering, the homebuilding operations were
part of BRC Properties Inc. BRC, formerly known as Borror Realty Company.
BRC was incorporated in 1946 and started building homes in 1976. BRC owned
4,176,500 common shares of the Company, or 654% of its outstanding common
shares, at December 31, 2000.
On November 16, 1999, Dominion Homes, Inc. formed Dominion Homes
Financial Services, Ltd. DHFS to provide mortgage services, primarily to its
customers. DHFS became operational in second quarter 2000 and by year-end
provided mortgage services to most of Dominion Homes' customers. On December 30,
1999, Dominion Homes, Inc. formed Dominion Homes of Kentucky, Ltd. DHK to
own and operate the Company homebuilding operations in Louisville, Kentucky.
DHFS is an Ohio limited liability company and DHK is a Kentucky limited
partnership. Both entities are wholly owned by Dominion Homes, Inc. The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DHFS and
DHK. Intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: For purposes of the consolidated statements
of cash flows, all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity
of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.
REAL ESTATE INVENTORIES: Real estate inventories are recorded at cost.
Land and land development costs are allocated to development phases based on the
total number of lots expected to be developed within each subdivision. As each
development phase is completed, land development costs, including capitalized
interest and real estate taxes, are then allocated to individual lots. Homes
under construction include land development costs, construction costs,
capitalized interest and indirect costs related to development and construction
activities. Indirect costs that do not relate to development and construction
activities, including general and administrative expenses, are charged to
expense as incurred. Other inventories consist primarily of lumber and building
supplies.
Management evaluates the recoverability of its real estate inventories
using several factors including, but not limited to, management plans for
future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT: Depreciation and amortization are recognized on
straight-line and declining-balance methods at rates adequate to amortize costs
over the estimated useful lives of the applicable assets. The estimated useful
lives of the assets range from three to forty years. Property and equipment
includes assets subject to capital leases with a cost of $2,058,000 and
$2,421,000, net of accumulated amortization of $566,000 and $476,000 at December
31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Depreciation expense was $1,099,000, $815,000
and $534,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to expense as
incurred while major renewals and betterments are capitalized and amortized. The
asset cost and accumulated depreciation is removed for assets sold or retired,
and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations.                    27
29
COMPUTER SOFTWARE COSTS: The Company capitalizes the costs of acquired
software and directly related implementation costs.
EARNINGS PER SHARE: Basic earnings per common share is computed by
dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per
common share computations include common share equivalents, when dilutive.
WARRANTY COSTS: The Company provides a two-year limited warranty on
materials and workmanship and a thirty-year warranty against major structural
defects. An estimated amount of warranty cost is provided for each home at the
date of closing based on actual warranty experience. Warranty expense was
$3,552,000, $2,759,000 and $2,250,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively. Accrued warranty cost was $1,895,000 and $1,180,000
at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
INCOME TAXES: The Company records income taxes on the liability method.
This method requires the recognition of deferred income taxes for the tax effect
of temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and such amounts as determined by tax regulations.
REVENUE RECOGNITION ON SALES OF REAL ESTATE: The Company recognizes
revenues from the sale of homes at the time the deed is conveyed from the
Company to the buyer. Accounts receivable due from financial institutions
represent payments to be received on completed closings. Gains on sales of model
homes subject to leasing arrangements are deferred and recognized over the term
of the lease.
CAPITALIZATION OF INTEREST: The Company capitalizes the cost of
interest related to construction costs incurred during the construction period
of homes and land development costs incurred while development activities on
undeveloped land are in process. The summary of total interest is as follows                                             Year Ended December 31,
2000        1999       1998
Interest incurred                          $10,430,000     $6,943,000    $5,069,000
Interest capitalized                         6,741,000     4,726,000    4,247,000
Interest expensed directly                      3,689,000      2,217,000      822,000
Previously capitalized interest charged to expense          5,436,000      3,807,000     3,735,000
Total interest expense                       $ 9,125,000     $6,024,000    $4,557,000
Capitalized interest in ending inventory              $ 4,609,000     $3,304,000    $2,384,000
DEFERRED COSTS: Fees and costs incurred in connection with financing
agreements are capitalized as other assets and amortized over the terms of the
respective agreements. Amortization expense was $549,000, $385,000 and $298,000
for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
ADVERTISING COSTS: The Company expenses advertising costs when
incurred. Advertising expense was $3,397,000, $2,876,000 and $2,383,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The Company has entered into interest
rate swap contracts as hedges against increasing rates on its variable rate
debt. Gains or losses related to the swap contracts are recognized as an
adjustment to interest expense over the life of the agreement.
UTILIZATION OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements                    28
30
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain prior year information has been reclassified
to conform with the current year presentation.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS: In June 2000, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities - an Amendment to FASB Statement No. 133, which modifies
certain provisions and definitions in accounting principles used in accounting
for derivative and hedging activities. The Company will be required to adopt
SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS No. 138, effective January 1, 2001. SFAS No.
133 standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments by requiring that all
entities recognize them as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and
subsequently measure them at fair market value. It also prescribes specific
accounting principles to be applied to hedging activities and hedging
transactions, which are significantly different from prior accounting
principles. The Company has identified that SFAS No. 133 provisions will be
applied to its interest rate swaps. The impact on the results of operations and
financial position is not expected to be significant. The Company continues to
review its operations for other possible derivative instruments. The impact of
these instruments on the results of operations and financial position, if any,
has not been determined.
3.    AFFILIATED ENTITY     Alliance Title Agency was created by the Company in order to provide
title insurance to the Company customers and third parties and to facilitate
the closing of the Company homes. The Company owns 499% of the title
insurance agency and reports its investment using the equity method of
accounting. The Company recognized $455,000, $454,000 and $532,000 as its share
of the earnings from this investment for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The
Company investment in the title insurance company was $219,915 and $159,998 at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and is included in other assets in the
accompanying balance sheets.

7.    NOTE PAYABLE, BANKS     On May 29, 1998 the Company entered into a Senior Unsecured Revolving
Credit Facility the Facility on which interest is payable monthly and that
matures on May 31, 2003. The Facility provided that aggregate borrowings and
letters of credit will not exceed the lesser of $125 million or the availability
under a borrowing base. The Facility was amended by a First Consent Agreement,
dated August 9, 1999, to increase to $25 million from $500,000, the amount of
Common Shares the Company is allowed to redeem or purchase in the aggregate
through December 31, 2001. A First Amendment to the Credit Agreement was
executed on September 3, 1999 which incorporated the First Consent Agreement and
modified the borrowing base limitations, changed the definition of Developed
Lots, modified several ratios, reduced the amount the Company is allowed to
invest in speculative homes and changed the amount of investment the Company is
allowed to make in markets outside of Central Ohio. A Second Consent and
Modification to the Facility was entered into on December 30, 1999, permitting
the Company to contribute and transfer certain assets of the Company division
operating in the metropolitan Louisville, Kentucky area to a new wholly-owned
subsidiary, Dominion Homes of Kentucky Ltd. This subsidiary is a Kentucky
limited partnership and is permitted to incur indebtedness to the Company,
provided such indebtedness meets all other Facility restrictions. A Second
Amendment to Credit Agreement was entered into on May 26, 2000 that increased
the Facility to $150 million from $125 million. On October 31, 2000 a Third
Amendment to Credit Agreement was entered into that amended the terms of the
borrowing base.                    31
33
As amended, the Facility contains the following significant provisions:
1 the Company has the option to use any combination of the following methods
to price the revolving line of credit: a the bank prime rate of interest or
b a Eurodollar rate of interest plus a variable margin based upon the
Company ratio of EBITDA to Interest Expense Interest Coverage Ratio; 2
the Company has agreed to enter into interest rate contracts in the amount of
fifty percent of the outstanding borrowings in the event the Eurodollar rate
without regard to the variable margin becomes 850% per annum or greater; 3
the Company has agreed to the following ratios: a Interest Coverage Ratio of
not less than 225 to 100 determined quarterly and based upon the preceding
four quarters; b total liabilities to tangible net worth of not greater than
250 to 100 through December 31, 2001 275 to 100 from May 1 through August
31 and 225 to 100 from and after January 1, 2002 250 to 100 from May 1
through August 31; 4 the Company has agreed to maintain at all times a ratio
of uncommitted land holdings to tangible net worth not greater than 200 to 100
through December 31, 2001 and not greater than 175 to 100 thereafter; 5 the
Company shall not, without lender approval, exceed the aggregate sum of $25
million for investments in uncommitted land holdings, speculative homes, model
homes and acquisitions of companies in the homebuilding industry outside of
Central Ohio or metropolitan Louisville, Kentucky, except that the Company may
not invest more than $15 million of such amount in one or more start-up
operations that are not associated with an ongoing business acquisition or more
than $20 million in the metropolitan Louisville, Kentucky area; 6 the Company
must maintain a tangible net worth of not less than $45 million plus
seventy-five percent of annual net income beginning with the fiscal year ending
December 31, 1999; 7 the Company shall not exceed the aggregate principal sum
of $10 million for other borrowings, additional debt or capital lease
obligations, except that the Company may borrow an additional $5 million of
non-recourse indebtedness from sellers of real estate, provided that such
additional non-recourse borrowings are fully reserved under the borrowing base;
8 the Company shall not exceed $3 million of operating lease rentals and $2
million of model home rentals; 9 the Company shall not purchase, without
lender approval, unzoned land in excess of $10 million; 10 the Company will
not permit the value of its inventory homes to exceed $125 million and its
model homes to exceed $65 million; 11 the Company may not incur a loss during
any five consecutive quarters; and 12 the Company may not pay dividends during
any calendar year in excess of twenty-five percent of the Company net income
after taxes for such year.
Note payable, banks consisted of $105,587,000 and $92,308,000 as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively due under the Facility.
The Facility provides for a variable rate of interest on its
borrowings. In order to reduce the risks caused by interest rate fluctuations,
the Company has entered into interest rate swap contracts that fix the interest
rate on a portion of its borrowings under the Facility. The Company intention
is to maintain a fixed rate of interest on approximately 50% of its outstanding
borrowings. However, market conditions and timing effect the Company ability
to maintain this balance between fixed and variable interest rates. As of
December 31, 2000 the Company had fixed the interest rate on 38%, or $40
million, of borrowings using interest rate swap contracts. Included in the
interest rate swaps at December 31, 2000 were a $10 million interest rate swap
at 548% that matures January 14, 2001, a $10 million interest rate swap at
596% that matures May 6, 2003 and a $20 million interest rate swap at 598%
that matures January 12, 2004. The fixed interest rates noted for the above
interest rate swaps does not include a variable margin that the Company also
pays that is based on the Company Interest Coverage Ratio. The variable margin
may range from 175% to 250% and is determined quarterly. On January 3, 2001
the Company entered into an additional $20 million interest rate swap at 562%
that matures January 12, 2004. The fair value of the interest rate swap
contracts was $160,000 and $378,000 at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
As of December 31, 2000 and 1999 the Company was in compliance with
Facility covenants and had $187 million and $162 million, respectively,
available under the Facility, after adjustment for borrowing base limitations.
However, the borrowing availability under the Facility could increase, depending
on the Company utilization of the proceeds.                    32
34
The Company had a combined $209 million in irrevocable letters of
credit and performance bonds outstanding at December 31, 2000. The letters of
credit and performance bonds were issued to municipalities and other individuals
to ensure performance and completion of certain land development activities and
as collateral for land purchase commitments. The Company does not anticipate
incurring any liabilities with respect to the letters of credit and performance
bonds.

11.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS     The Company leases its corporate offices from BRC. The lease was
effective January 1, 1998 for a term of twelve years with a rental rate of
$1200 per square foot on a total net basis. The lease contains two options to
renew for periods of five years each at then-current market rates. The rental
rates were established by an MAI appraiser commissioned by the Affiliated
Transaction Review Committee of the Company Board of Directors, and confirmed
in a review by a second MAI appraiser. Lease expense was $451,000 for the years
ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998.
The Company and BRC have also entered into operating lease agreements
under which the Company leases space in a shopping center from BRC. Lease
expense under these agreements for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and
1998 was $156,000, $70,000 and $62,000, respectively. These lease agreements
have been approved by the Company Affiliated Transaction Review Committee.
BRC paid the Company $25,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, for
miscellaneous services performed by Company personnel.
The Company acquired printing services from a printing company
principally owned by members of the Borror family. Such services aggregated
$98,000, $80,000 and $225,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively.
12.   RETIREMENT PLAN     The Company offers a retirement plan intended to meet the requirements
of Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code and that covers substantially all
employees after one year of service. On January 1, 1999, the Company began
matching 100% of the first 3% of employee voluntary deferrals of compensation
and 50% of the next 2% of voluntary deferrals of compensation. The Company
contributions to the plan amounted to $511,000, $454,000 and $447,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.                    35
37 13.   INCENTIVE STOCK AND EXECUTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS     In March 1994, the Company adopted the Dominion Homes, Inc. Incentive
Stock Plan the Plan. The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee
of the Board of Directors, and provides for grants of performance awards of
Common Shares, restricted Common Shares, incentive stock options and
non-qualified options for the purpose of attracting, motivating and retaining
key employees and eligible directors. The Plan provides for discretionary grants
to employees of the Company and annual non-discretionary stock option grants to
purchase 2,500 shares of stock to each non-employee director. A maximum of
850,000 Common Shares have been reserved for issuance under the Plan. The Plan
provides that grants shall include certain terms and conditions and be subject
to certain restrictions as provided for under applicable provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code and federal securities laws. In general, grants of options
are subject to vesting schedules at twenty percent a year, set forth an exercise
price that is equal to the fair market value on the grant date 110% of the fair
market value for 10% shareholders, and must be exercised within ten years of
the grant date 5 years for 10% shareholders.
In December 1994, the Company adopted a non-qualified Executive
Deferred Compensation Plan for directors and certain executives. Under this
plan, participants may elect to defer a portion of their compensation up to 20%
of total base and bonus for employees and 100% of director fees. At December 31
of each year, the Company provides a matching contribution of 25% of the amount
deferred in a given year by a participant, provided that the Company matching
contribution will not exceed $2,500 in any year. The Company contribution
vests in 20% increments over a five-year period. As originally adopted,
contributions were to be converted into theoretical common shares and adjusted
in future periods based on the market value of the Common Shares, similar to
stock appreciation rights. On October 29, 1997, the Board of Directors approved
an Amended and Restated Executive Deferred Compensation Plan under which
contribution and matching amounts are used by the trustee to acquire Common
Shares of the Company in the open market. These Common Shares are held and voted
by the trustee pursuant to a Rabbi Trust Agreement.
The Company has entered into agreements with certain employees that
provide for the transfer of life insurance benefits to the employees in the
event that certain performance and employment criteria are met. Until the
performance and employment criteria are met, premiums paid on the life insurance
contracts, up to the accumulated cash value, are retained by the Company. In
most cases the employment criteria cannot be met for a minimum of ten years.
Once the performance and employment criteria are met, the accumulated cash value
of the life insurance contracts will be transferred to the employee as a
retirement benefit. Premiums on the life insurance contracts are expensed as
incurred and the Company has recognized an asset for the cash value of life
insurance of $793,000 and $341,000, at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.                    36

The Company applies APB Opinion 25 and related Interpretations in
accounting for its plans. The Company recognized expense for the Executive
Deferred Compensation Plan of $80,000, $41,000 and $48,000 for the plan years
ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. No compensation cost has
been recognized for its Incentive Stock Plan. Had compensation cost for the
Company Incentive Stock Plan been determined based on the fair value of awards
at the grant dates, the Company net income and earnings per share would have
been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below                                     2000        1999       1998

fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions: no dividend yield; expected volatility of 800%, 800%, and 500%
for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively; risk-free interest rates of 65%, 55 and 55% for the 2000, 1999 and 1998 Plan options, respectively; and expected
life of 6 years for the Plan options.                    37
