43 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Stockholders Rent-A-Center, Inc. and
Subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Rent-A-Center, Inc. and
Subsidiaries as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December31, 2005. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of
Rent-A-Center, Inc. and
Subsidiaries as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of
Rent-A-Center, Inc. and
Subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Our report dated March10, 2006, included on
page45 of this report expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment that
Rent-A-Center, Inc. and
Subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2005, was effective based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and managements
assessment thereof. s/ Grant Thornton LLP Dallas, Texas March10, 2006 44 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Stockholders Rent-A-Center, Inc. and
Subsidiaries We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting, that
Rent-A-Center, Inc. and
Subsidiaries the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The
Companys management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established by COSO. Also, in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005, based on criteria established by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
December31, 2005 and 2004 consolidated balance sheets and
the related consolidated statements of earnings,
stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2005 of the Company
and our report dated March10, 2006, expressed an
unqualified opinion. s/ Grant Thornton LLP Dallas, Texas March10, 2006 45 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as defined in
Rule13a-15f
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The
Companys internal control system was designed to provide
reasonable assurance to management and our board of directors
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
inherent limitations. A system of internal control may become
inadequate over time because of changes in conditions, or
deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and presentation. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005 using the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSOin Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of
December31, 2005, the Companys internal control over
financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles based
on such criteria. Grant Thornton LLP, our independent registered public accounting
firm, has issued an audit report on our assessment of internal
control over financial reporting. This report appears on

See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. 50 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NoteA Summary of Accounting Policies and
Nature of Operations A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the
preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements follows   
Principles of Consolidation and Nature of
Operations These financial statements include the accounts of
Rent-A-Center, Inc.
Rent-A-Center
and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries
collectively, the Company. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. At
December31, 2005, the Company operated
2,760company-owned stores nationwide and in Puerto Rico
and Canada, including 21 stores in Wisconsin operated by a
subsidiary, Get It Now, LLC, under the name Get It
Now, and seven stores in Canada operated by a subsidiary,
Rent-A-Centre Canada, Ltd., under the name
Rent-A-Centre. The Companys primary operating
segment consists of renting household durable goods to customers
on a rent-to-own basis.
Get It Now offers merchandise on an installment sales basis in
Wisconsin. ColorTyme, Inc. ColorTyme, an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of
Rent-A-Center, is a
nationwide franchisor of 296 franchised
rent-to-own stores
operating in 38states at December31, 2005. These
rent-to-own stores
offer high quality durable products such as home electronics,
appliances, computers, and furniture and accessories.
ColorTymes primary source of revenues is the sale of
rental merchandise to its franchisees, who, in turn, offer the
merchandise to the general public for rent or purchase under a
rent-to-own program.
The balance of ColorTymes revenue is generated primarily
from royalties based on franchisees monthly gross revenues.   
Stock Split On July28, 2003,
Rent-A-Center announced
that its Board of Directors had approved a 5 for 2 stock split
on its common stock to be paid in the form of a stock dividend.
Each common stockholder of record on August15, 2003
received 15 additional shares of common stock for each share of
common stock held on that date. No fractional shares were issued
in connection with the stock dividend. Each stockholder who
would otherwise have received a fractional share received an
additional share of common stock. The distribution date for the
stock dividend was August29, 2003. The effect of the stock
split has been recognized retroactively in all share data in the
consolidated financial statements unless otherwise noted.   
Rental Merchandise Rental merchandise is carried at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation for all merchandise is provided using
the income forecasting method, which is intended to match as
closely as practicable the recognition of depreciation expense
with the consumption of the rental merchandise, and assumes no
salvage value. The consumption of rental merchandise occurs
during periods of rental and directly coincides with the receipt
of rental revenue over the rental-purchase agreement period,
generally 7 to 36months. Under the income forecasting
method, merchandise held for rent is not depreciated and
merchandise on rent is depreciated in the proportion of rents
received to total rents provided in the rental contract, which
is an activity-based method similar to the units of production
method. On computers that are 24months old or older and
which have become idle, depreciation is recognized using the
straight-line method for a period of at least six months,
generally not to exceed an aggregate depreciation period of
36months. The purpose is to better reflect the depreciable
life of a computer in our stores and to encourage the sale of
older computers. Rental merchandise which is damaged and inoperable, or not
returned by the customer after becoming delinquent on payments,
is expensed when such impairment occurs. Any repairs made to
rental merchandise are expensed at the time of the repair. 51 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   
Cash Equivalents For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash equivalents include
all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less.   
Revenue Merchandise is rented to customers pursuant to rental-purchase
agreements which provide for weekly, semi-monthly or monthly
rental terms with non-refundable rental payments. Generally, the
customer has the right to acquire title either through a
purchase option or through payment of all required rentals.
Rental revenue and fees are recognized over the rental term and
merchandise sales revenue is recognized when the customer
exercises its purchase option and pays the cash price due.
Revenue for the total amount of the rental purchase agreement is
not accrued because the customer can terminate the rental
agreement at any time and the Company cannot enforce collection
for non-payment of rents. ColorTymes revenue from the sale
of rental merchandise is recognized upon shipment of the
merchandise to the franchisee. Franchise fee revenue is
recognized upon completion of substantially all services and
satisfaction of all material conditions required under the terms
of the franchise agreement. Because Get It Now makes retail
sales on an installment credit basis, Get It Nows revenue
is recognized at the time of such retail sale, as is the cost of
the merchandise sold, net of a provision for uncollectible
accounts. The revenue from our financial services is recorded
differently depending on the type of transaction. Fees collected
on loans are recognized ratably over the term of the loan. For
money orders, wire transfers, check cashing and other customer
service type transactions, fee revenue is recognized at the time
of the transactions.   
Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Get It Now sells merchandise through installment sales
transactions. The installment note generally consists of the
sales price of the merchandise purchased and any additional fees
for services the customer has chosen, less the customers
down payment. No interest is accrued and interest income is
recognized each time a customer makes a payment, generally on a
monthly basis. The Companys financial services business
extends short term secured and unsecured loans. The loans are
funded with the Companys cash from operations. The amount
and length of the loan may vary depending on applicable state
law. The Company has established an allowance for doubtful
accounts for Get It Nows installment notes and loan
receivables associated with the Companys financial
services business. The Companys policy for determining the
allowance is based on historical loss experience generally, as
well as the results of managements review and analysis of
the payment and collection of the installment notes and trade
receivables within the previous quarter. Management believes
that the Companys allowances are adequate to absorb any
known or probable losses. The Companys policy is to charge
off installment notes that are 90days or more past due and
loan receivables that are 30days or more past due.
Charge-offs are applied as a reduction to the allowance for
doubtful accounts and any recoveries of previously charged off
balances are applied as an increase to the allowance for
doubtful accounts. The majority of ColorTymes accounts receivable relate to
amounts due from franchisees. Credit is extended based on an
evaluation of a customers financial condition and
collateral is generally not required. Accounts receivable are
due within 30days and are stated at amounts due from
customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts
that are outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms
are considered past due. ColorTyme determines its allowance by
considering a number of factors, including the length of time
trade accounts receivable are past due, ColorTymes
previous loss history, the franchisees current ability to
pay its obligation to ColorTyme, and the condition of the
general economy and the industry as a whole. ColorTyme writes
off accounts receivable that are 120days or more past due,
and payments subsequently received on such receivables are
credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts. 52 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   
Property Assets and Related Depreciation Furniture, equipment and vehicles are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets generally five
years by the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the useful life of the asset or the initial term
of the applicable leases by the straight-line method, whichever
is shorter. The Company incurs repair and maintenance expenses
on its vehicles and equipment. These amounts are expensed when
incurred, unless such repairs significantly extend the life of
the asset, in which case the Company amortizes the cost of the
repairs for the remaining life of the asset utilizing the
straight-line method.   
Intangible Assets and Amortization Goodwill is the cost in excess of the fair value of net assets
of acquired businesses. Goodwill is evaluated at least annually
for impairment, in accordance with SFASNo142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Intangible assets
that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated
useful lives. Under SFASNo142, the Company is required to test
all existing goodwill for impairment. In December of each year,
we use a discounted cash flow approach to test goodwill for
impairment. There were no impairment charges in 2005, 2004 or
2003 for goodwill based on this test. However, in 2005, as a
result of our store consolidation plan and Hurricane Katrina,
the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately
$45million and $37million, respectively.   
Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates all long-lived assets, including
intangible assets, excluding goodwill and rental merchandise,
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
Impairment is recognized when the carrying amounts of such
assets cannot be recovered by the undiscounted net cash flows
they will generate.   
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities The Company is not currently a party to any interest rate swap
agreements. Under the Companys previous credit facility,
the Company entered into interest-rate swap agreements in order
to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by
decreasing the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated
with changes in the applicable rates. The interest-rate swaps
were derivative instruments related to forecasted transactions
and hedged future cash flows. The effective portion of any gains
or losses were included in accumulated other comprehensive
income loss until earnings were affected by the variability of
cash flows. Any ineffective portion was recognized into
earnings. The cash flows of the interest-rate swaps offset cash
flows attributable to fluctuations in the cash flows of the
previous floating-rate senior credit facility. If it became
probable a forecasted transaction would no longer occur, the
interest-rate swaps were carried on the balance sheet at fair
value, and gains or losses that were deferred in accumulated
other comprehensive income loss were recognized immediately
into earnings. Changes in the fair value of the effective cash flow hedges were
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss. The
effective portion that had been deferred in accumulated other
comprehensive income loss was reclassified to earnings when
the hedged items impacted earnings. The interest-rate swaps were based on the same index as their
respective underlying debt. The interest-rate swaps were
effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the
fluctuations in the cash flows of the hedged risk, and no amount
was required to be reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income loss into earnings for hedge
ineffectiveness during the year ended December31, 2003.
The interest-rate swap resulted in an increase of interest
expense of $45million for the year ended
December31, 2003. In May 2003, the Company extinguished
the remaining interest rate swap in connection with its
recapitalization 53 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued program. The accumulated loss in other comprehensive income of
approximately $37million was recognized immediately into
earnings and is included in the finance charge of
$353million on the statement of earnings for 2003.   
Income Taxes The Company records deferred taxes for temporary differences
between the tax and financial reporting bases of assets and
liabilities at the rate expected to be in effect when taxes
become payable.   
Earnings Per Common Share Basic earnings per common share are based upon the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during each period
presented. Diluted earnings per common share are based upon the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period, plus, if dilutive, the assumed exercise of stock options
and the assumed conversion of convertible securities at the
beginning of the year, or for the period outstanding during the
year for current year issuances.   
Advertising Costs Costs incurred for producing and communicating advertising are
expensed when incurred. Advertising expense was
$671million, $627million, and $678million
in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.   
Stock-Based Compensation The Company maintains a long-term incentive plan for the benefit
of certain employees, consultants and directors, which is
described more fully in NoteN. The Company accounts for
this plan under the recognition and measurement principles of
APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related Interpretations. No stock-based
employee compensation cost is reflected in net earnings, as all
options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to
the quoted market price of the underlying common stock on the
date of grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings and
earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASBStatement No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee
compensation.

Continued For all periods prior to April1, 2004, the fair value of
these options was estimated at the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions: expected volatility of 550%, risk-free
interest rates of 29% and 37% and expected lives of four years
in 2004 and seven years in 2003, respectively, and no dividend
yield. For options granted on or after April1, 2004, the
fair value of the options was estimated at the date of grant
using the binomial method pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions: expected volatility of 461%, a
risk-free interest rate of 36%, no dividend yield and an
expected life of four years. Had the Company changed from using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model to a binomial method
pricing model effective January1, 2003 rather than
April1, 2004, the impact would not have been significant.   
Use of Estimates In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
management is required to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent losses and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. In applying accounting
principles, the Company must often make individual estimates and
assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties. The
Companys estimates, judgments and assumptions are
continually evaluated based on available information and
experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the
financial reporting process, actual results could differ from
those estimates. The Company believes that self-insurance
liabilities, litigation and tax reserves are areas where the
degree of judgment and complexity in determining amounts
recorded in its consolidated financial statements make the
accounting policies critical. Please see the Critical Accounting
Policies Involving Critical Estimates, Uncertainties or
Assessment in Our Financial Statements section on page26
of this report.   
Other Income In December 2004, the Company sold to certain qualified buyers
its right to collect outstanding amounts due, as well as its
interest in the merchandise rented, pursuant to delinquent
rental purchase agreements that have been charged off in the
ordinary course of business. The accounts ranged from
approximately one to five years old. The Company sold such
accounts for approximately $79million and recorded such
amount as other income in its consolidated statement of earnings.   
New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB enacted SFAS123R, which replaces
SFAS123, and supersedes APB25. SFAS123R
requires the measurement of all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a
fair-value-based method and the recording of such expense in our
consolidated statement of earnings. The accounting provisions of
SFAS123R are effective for fiscal years beginning after
June15, 2005. The Company is required to adopt SFAS123R in the first
quarter of 2006. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted
under SFAS123 will no longer be an alternative to
financial statement recognition. See the Stock-Based
Compensation section shown above for the pro forma net
earnings and earnings per share amounts for 2005 and 2004 as if
the Company had used a fair-value-based method under
SFAS123 to measure compensation expense for employee stock
incentive awards. The actual effects of SFAS123R will
depend on numerous factors, including the amounts of share-based
payments granted in the future, the method used to value future
share-based payments to the Companys employees and
estimated forfeiture rates. The Company will be adopting
SFAS123R under the prospective method and estimates
recognizing additional pre-tax compensation expense of
approximately $004 and $003per diluted share, for the
years ended December31, 2006 and 2007, respectively, based
on the number of options outstanding at
December31,2005, and assuming 55 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued that the Company continues to issue stock options under the Plan
consistent with its current policy and procedures. The decrease
in the estimated expense under SFAS123R, as compared to
the pro forma expense shown in the Stock-Based Compensation
table earlier, is primarily due to methods of calculation that
are permitted under SFAS123R versus the methods under
SFAS123. SFAS123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in
excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a
financing cash flow, whereas current accounting rules prescribe
that the benefits be reported as an operating cash flow. This
requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase
net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. Total cash
flow will remain unchanged from what would have been reported
under prior accounting rules. NoteB Receivables and Allowance for

The total purchase price includes non-cash consideration of
approximately $238million in common stock issued and
approximately $61million in fair value assigned to the
stock options assumed in connection with the acquisition of Rent
Rite, Inc. Rent-Way, Inc. On February8, 2003, the Company
completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of
295rent-to-own
stores from Rent-Way, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of
$1004million in cash. Of the aggregate purchase price,
the Company held back $100million to pay for various
indemnified liabilities and expenses, if any, of which
$50million was remitted in the second quarter of 2003 and
$50million was remitted in August 2004. The Company
funded the acquisition entirely from cash on hand. Of the 295
stores, 176 were subsequently merged with the Companys
existing store locations. The asset values are based upon the
fair value assigned to the tangible and identifiable intangible
assets acquired which are based upon the present value of future
cash flows, historic longevity of like-kind customer base,
historic profitability of like-kind customer base and the number
of customer relationships acquired. The excess of purchase
consideration over the fair value of tangible assets and
identifiable intangible assets acquired was assigned to
goodwill. The final purchase price allocation resulted in a
$40million decrease in the value assigned to customer
relationships and a $40million increase in the value
placed on the non-compete agreement as compared to the
Companys original estimates as disclosed in its 2002

operating results of the acquired stores and accounts have been
included in the financial statements since their date of
acquisition. NoteF Store Consolidation Plan On September6, 2005, the Company announced its plan to
close up to 162 stores by December31, 2005. The decision
to close these stores was based on managements analysis
and evaluation of the markets in which the Company operates,
including its market share, operating results, competitive
positioning and growth potential for the affected stores. The
162 stores included 114 stores that the company intended to
close and merge with its existing stores and up to 48 additional
stores that it intended to sell, merge with a potential
acquisition or close by December31, 2005. As of
December31, 2005, the Company had merged 113 of the 114
stores identified to be merged with existing locations, sold 35
and merged one of the additional 48 stores on the plan. The Company estimated that it would incur restructuring expenses
in the range of $121million to $251million, to be
recorded in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year
ending December31, 2005, based on the closing date of the
stores. During the year ended December31, 2005, the
Company recorded restructuring charges of $152million.

Goodwill impairment charges are the primary component of other
costs. Additional costs include inventory disposals and the
removal of signs and various assets from vacated locations. The Company expects the total estimated cash outlay in
connection with the store consolidation plan to be between
$90million to $137million. The total amount of
cash used in the store consolidation plan during 61 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued 2005 was approximately $40million. Therefore, the Company
expects to use approximately $50million to
$97million of cash on hand for future payments primarily
related to the satisfaction of lease obligations for closed
stores. NoteG Recapitalization Recapitalization. In April 2003, the Company announced
and commenced a program to recapitalize a portion of its
financial structure in a series of transactions. The
recapitalization consisted of the tender offer for all of
Rent-A-Center
Easts $27225million principal amount of senior
subordinated notes, paying 11% interest, due 2008 the
11%Notes, the redemption of the
11%Notes, the issuance of $3000million principal
amount of senior subordinated notes, paying
71/2%
interest, due 2010 the
71/2%Notes,
the refinancing of its senior debt and the repurchase of shares
of its common stock. On May6, 2003, the Company repurchased approximately
$1830million principal amount of 11%Notes pursuant
to a debt tender offer announced on April23, 2003. On
August15, 2003, the Company redeemed all of the remaining
outstanding 11%Notes in accordance with the terms of the
indenture governing the 11%Notes, at the applicable
redemption price of 1055% of the principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest to that date. The total aggregate redemption
price for the 11%Notes was approximately
$9375million, including $465million in accrued
interest and $465million in redemption premium. Proceeds
from the offering of $300million in
71/2%Notes
were used to pay for the redemption. On April25, 2003,
Rent-A-Center announced
that it entered into an agreement with affiliates of Apollo
Management together Apollo which provided for the
repurchase of a number of shares of
Rent-A-Centers
common stock sufficient to reduce Apollos aggregate record
ownership to 1900% after consummation of
Rent-A-Centers
planned tender offer at the price per share paid in the tender
offer. On April28, 2003,
Rent-A-Center commenced
a tender offer to purchase up to 22million shares of
Rent-A-Centers
common stock on a pre-split basis pursuant to a modified
Dutch Auction. On June25, 2003,
Rent-A-Center closed
the tender offer and purchased 1,769,960shares of
Rent-A-Centers
common stock on a pre-split basis at $73per share on a
pre-split basis for approximately $1292million. On
July11, 2003,
Rent-A-Center closed
the Apollo transaction and purchased 774,547shares of
Rent-A-Centers
common stock on a pre-split basis at $73per share on a
pre-split basis for approximately $565million. As
contemplated by the Apollo agreement, Apollo also exchanged
their shares of SeriesA preferred stock for shares of
SeriesC preferred stock. As a result, no shares of
SeriesA preferred stock remain outstanding. The terms of
the SeriesA preferred stock and SeriesC preferred
stock were substantially similar, except the SeriesC
preferred stock did not have the right to directly elect any
members of
Rent-A-Centers
Board of Directors. As of December31, 2005, no shares of
SeriesC preferred stock remained outstanding. On May6, 2003,
Rent-A-Center issued
$3000million in
71/2%Notes,
the proceeds of which were used, in part, to fund the repurchase
and redemption of the 11%Notes. On May28, 2003, the Company refinanced its then existing
senior debt by entering into a new $6000million senior
credit facility, consisting then of a $4000million term
loan, a $1200million revolving credit facility and an
$800million additional term loan. During the second and third quarter of 2003, the Company
recorded an aggregate of $353million in non-recurring
financing charges in connection with the foregoing
recapitalization which consisted of senior subordinated note
premiums of approximately $187million, senior
subordinated note issue costs and loan origination fees of
approximately $119million and other bank charges and fees
of approximately $47million. NoteH Senior Credit Facilities The Companys existing $6000million senior credit
facilities consist of a $3500million term loan and a
$2500million revolving credit facility. In connection
with the Companys refinancing in 2003, the Company 62 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued recorded a $42million non-cash charge to write off the
remaining unamortized balance of financing costs in the third

At December31, 2005 and 2004, the amounts available under
the Companys revolving facility were reduced by
approximately $1075million and $1056million,
respectively, for outstanding letters of credit used to support
the Companys insurance obligations. The Company provides
assurance to its insurance providers that if they are not able
to draw funds from the Company for claims paid, they have the
ability to draw against the Companys letters of credit. At
that time, the Company would then owe the drawn amount to the
financial institution providing the letter of credit. One of the
Companys letters of credit is renewed automatically every
year unless the Company notifies the institution not to renew.
The other letter of credit expires in August 2006, but is
automatically renewed each year for a one year period unless the
institution notifies the Company no later than thirty days prior
to the applicable expiration date that such institution does not
elect to renew the letter of credit for such additional one year
period. Borrowings under the Companys senior credit facilities
bear interest at varying rates equal to the Eurodollar rate plus
100% to 200%, or the prime rate plus up to 100%, at the
Companys election. The weighted average Eurodollar rate on
our outstanding debt was 449% at December31, 2005. None
of the Companys outstanding borrowings at
December31, 2005 utilized the prime rate option. The
margins on the Eurodollar rate and on the prime rate may
fluctuate dependent upon an increase or decrease in the
Companys consolidated leverage ratio as defined by a
pricing grid set forth in its credit agreement. For the year
ended December31, 2005, the average effective rate on
outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facilities was
629%. The Company has not entered into any interest rate
protection agreements with respect to term loans under the new
senior credit facility. A commitment fee equal to 020% to 050%
of the unused portion of the revolving credit facility is
payable quarterly. The Companys senior credit facilities contain, without
limitation, covenants that generally limit its ability to   
incur additional debt including subordinated debt in excess of

Events of default under the Companys senior credit
facility include customary events, such as a cross-acceleration
provision in the event that it defaults on other debt. In
addition, an event of default under the senior credit facility
would occur if there is a change of control. This is defined to
include the case where a third party becomes the beneficial
owner of 35% or more of
Rent-A-Centers
voting stock or certain changes in
Rent-A-Centers
Board of Directors occur. An event of default would also occur
if one or more judgments were entered against the Company of
$200million or more and such judgments were not satisfied
or bonded pending appeal within 30days after entry. The following are scheduled maturities of the senior term debt

the right to require
Rent-A-Center to
repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the original
aggregate principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. This would trigger

NoteK Redeemable Convertible Voting
Preferred Stock In August 1998,
Rent-A-Center issued
$2600million of redeemable convertible voting preferred
stock with a $01par value. In connection with such
issuance, Rent-A-Center
entered into a registration rights 65 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued agreement with affiliates of Apollo which, among other things,
granted them two rights to request that their shares be
registered, and a registration rights agreement with an
affiliate of Bear Stearns, which granted them the right to
participate in any company-initiated registration of shares,
subject to certain exceptions. In May 2002, Apollo exercised one
of their two rights to request that their shares be registered
and an affiliate of Bear Stearns elected to participate in such
registration. In connection therewith, Apollo and the affiliate
of Bear Stearns converted 97,197shares of
Rent-A-Centers
preferred stock held by them into 3,500,000shares on a
pre-split basis of
Rent-A-Centers
common stock, which they sold in the May 2002 public offering
that was the subject of Apollos request.
Rent-A-Center did not
receive any of the proceeds from this offering. On August5, 2002, the first date in which
Rent-A-Center had the
right to optionally redeem the shares of preferred stock, the
holders of
Rent-A-Centers
preferred stock converted all but two shares of
Rent-A-Centers
preferred stock held by them into 7,281,548shares of
Rent-A-Centers
common stock on a pre-split basis. As a result, the dividend
on Rent-A-Centers
preferred stock was substantially eliminated. Rent-A-Centers
preferred stock was convertible, at any time, into shares of
Rent-A-Centers
common stock at a conversion price equal to $11174per
share, and had a liquidation preference of $1,000per
share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. No distributions
were permitted to holders of common stock until the holders of
the preferred stock had received the liquidation preference.
Dividends accrued on a quarterly basis, at the rate of
$3750per annum, per share. During 2002,
Rent-A-Center accounted
for shares of preferred stock distributed as dividends in-kind
at the greater of the stated value or the value of the common
stock obtainable upon conversion on the payment date. During
2002, Rent-A-Center
paid approximately $82million in preferred dividends by
issuing 8,151shares of preferred stock. During 2004 and
2003, Rent-A-Center
paid all preferred stock dividends in cash. In May 2005, Apollo sold all of the remaining shares of
Rent-A-Center common
stock held by them in a public offering which closed on
May31, 2005.
Rent-A-Center did not
receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares by
Apollo. In connection with such sale, Apollo converted the two
issued and outstanding shares of
Rent-A-Center
SeriesC preferred stock into 180shares of common
stock, all of which were sold in the public offering. As a
result of the conversion, no shares of
Rent-A-Center
SeriesC preferred stock remain outstanding. In addition,
as a result of the sale by Apollo of all of the shares of
Rent-A-Center common
stock held by them, the stockholders agreement with Apollo
terminated pursuant to its terms. NoteL Income Taxes The income tax provision reconciled to the tax computed at the

From time to time, the Company is party to various legal
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Except
as described below, the Company is not currently a party to any
material litigation. The ultimate outcome of the Companys
litigation is uncertain and the amount of any loss it may incur,
if any, cannot in its judgment be reasonably estimated.
Accordingly, other than with respect to the settlement of the
Pucci/Chess matter, the prospective settlement of
the Rose/ Madrigal matter discussed below as well as
anticipated legal fees and expenses for its other litigation
matters, no provision has been made in the Companys
consolidated financial statements for any such loss. Colonv. Thorn Americas, Inc. The plaintiff filed
this class action in November 1997 in New York state court. This
matter was assumed by the Company in connection with the Thorn
Americas acquisition. The plaintiff acknowledges that
rent-to-own
transactions in New York are subject to the provisions of New
Yorks Rental Purchase Statute but contends the Rental
Purchase Statute does not provide the Company immunity from suit
for other statutory violations. The plaintiff alleges the
Company has a duty to disclose effective interest under New York
consumer protection laws, and seeks damages and injunctive
relief for failure to do so. This suit also alleges violations
relating to excessive and unconscionable pricing, late fees,
harassment, undisclosed charges, and the ease of use and
accuracy of payment records. In the prayer for relief, the
plaintiff requests class certification, injunctive relief
requiring the Company to cease certain marketing practices and
price its rental purchase contracts in certain ways, unspecified
compensatory and punitive damages, rescission of the class
members contracts, an order placing in trust all moneys received
by the Company in connection with the rental of merchandise
during the class period, treble damages, attorneys fees,
filing fees and costs of suit, pre- and post-judgment interest,
and any further relief granted by the court. The plaintiff has
not alleged a specific monetary amount with respect to the
request for damages. The proposed class includes all New York residents who were
party to the Companys
rent-to-own contracts
from November26, 1994. In November 2000, following
interlocutory appeal by both parties from the denial of
cross-motions for summary judgment, the Company obtained a
favorable ruling from the Appellate Division of the State of New
York, dismissing the plaintiffs claims based on the
alleged failure to disclose an effective interest rate. The
plaintiffs other claims were not dismissed. The plaintiff
moved to certify a state-wide class in December 2000. The
plaintiffs class certification motion was heard by the
court on November7, 2001 and, on September12, 2002,
the court issued an opinion denying in part and granting in part
the plaintiffs requested certification. The opinion grants
certification as to all of the plaintiffs claims except
the plaintiffs pricing claims pursuant to the Rental
Purchase Statute, as to which certification was denied. The
parties have differing views as to the effect of the
courts opinion, and accordingly, the court 68 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued granted the parties permission to submit competing orders as to
the effect of the opinion on the plaintiffs specific
claims. Both proposed orders were submitted to the court on
March27, 2003, and on May30, 2003, the court held a
hearing regarding such orders. No clarifying order has yet been
entered by the court. From June 2003 until May 2005, there was no activity in this
case. On May18, 2005, the Company filed a motion to
dismiss the plaintiffs claim and to decertify the class,
based upon the plaintiffs failure to schedule her claim in
this matter in her earlier voluntary bankruptcy proceeding. The
plaintiff opposed the Companys motion and asked the court
for an opportunity to find a substitute class representative in
the event the court determined Ms.Colon was no longer
adequate. On January17, 2006, the court issued an order
denying the Companys motion, but noted that no motion to
intervene to add additional class representatives had been
filed. A conference with the court has been scheduled for
March14, 2006. If the court ultimately enters a final
certification order, the Company intends to pursue an
interlocutory appeal of such certification order. The Company believes these claims are without merit and will
continue to vigorously defend itself in this case. However, the
Company cannot assure you that it will be found to have no
liability in this matter. Terry Walker, et. al.v.
Rent-A-Center, Inc.,
et. al. On January4, 2002, a putative class action was
filed against the Company and certain of its current and former
officers and directors by Terry Walker in federal court in
Texarkana, Texas. The complaint alleged that the defendants
violated Sections10b and/or Section20a of the
Securities Exchange Act and
Rule10b-5
promulgated thereunder by issuing false and misleading
statements and omitting material facts regarding the
Companys financial performance and prospects for the third
and fourth quarters of 2001. The complaint purported to be
brought on behalf of all purchasers of the Companys common
stock from April25, 2001 through October8, 2001 and
sought damages in unspecified amounts. Similar complaints were
consolidated by the court with the Walker matter in
October 2002. On November25, 2002, the lead plaintiffs in the Walker
matter filed an amended consolidated complaint which added
certain of the Companys outside directors as defendants to
the Exchange Act claims. The amended complaint also added
additional claims that the Company, and certain of its current
and former officers and directors, violated various provisions
of the Securities Act as a result of alleged misrepresentations
and omissions in connection with an offering in May 2001 and
also added the managing underwriters in that offering as
defendants. On February7, 2003, the Company, along with certain
officer and director defendants, filed a motion to dismiss the
matter as well as a motion to transfer venue. In addition, the
Companys outside directors named in the matter separately
filed a motion to dismiss the Securities Act claims on statute
of limitations grounds. On February19, 2003, the
underwriter defendants also filed a motion to dismiss the
matter. The plaintiffs filed response briefs to these motions,
to which the Company replied on May21, 2003. A hearing was
held by the court on June26, 2003 to hear each of these
motions. On September30, 2003, the court granted the Companys
motion to dismiss without prejudice, dismissed without prejudice
the outside directors and underwriters separate
motions to dismiss and denied the Companys motion to
transfer venue. In its order on the motions to dismiss, the
court granted the lead plaintiffs leave to replead the case
within certain parameters. On July7, 2004, the plaintiffs again repled their claims
by filing a third amended consolidated complaint, raising
allegations of similar violations against the same parties
generally based upon alleged facts not previously asserted. The
Company, along with certain officer and director defendants and
the underwriter defendants, filed motions to dismiss the third
amended consolidated complaint on August23, 2004. A
hearing on the motions was held on April14, 2005. On
July25, 2005, the court ruled on these motions, dismissing
with prejudice the claims against the Companys outside
directors as well as the underwriter defendants, but denying the
Companys motion to dismiss. In evaluating this motion to
dismiss, the court was required to view the pleadings in the
light most favorable to the plaintiffs and to take the
plaintiffs allegations as true. On 69 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued August18, 2005, the Company filed a motion to certify the
dismissal order for an interlocutory appeal, which was denied on
November14, 2005. Discovery in this matter has now
commenced. A hearing on class certification is scheduled for
June22, 2006. The Company continues to believe the plaintiffs claims in
this matter are without merit and intends to vigorously defend
itself as this matter progresses. However, the Company cannot
assure you that it will be found to have no liability in this
matter. California Attorney General Inquiry. During the second
quarter of 2004, the Company received an inquiry from the
California Attorney General regarding its business practices in
California with respect to its cash prices and its membership
program. The Company met with representatives of the Attorney
Generals office during the first quarter and fourth
quarter of 2005, and provided additional information with
respect to its membership program as requested. The Company is
continuing to discuss these issues with the Attorney
Generals office.   
State Wage and Hour ClassActions The Company recently settled a material action pending against
it in Oregon, and is currently subject to various material
actions pending against it in the states of California and
Washington, all of which allege it violated the wage and hour
laws of such states. Rob Pucci, et. alv.
Rent-A-Center, Inc;
Jeremy Chess et. al.v.
Rent-A-Center, Inc. et.
al.; Clemmons et.al.v.
Rent-A-Center, Inc.,
et. al. On August20, 2001, the putative class action
entitled Rob Pucci, et. al.v.
Rent-A-Center, Inc.
was filed in state court in Multnomah County, Oregon alleging
the Company violated various provisions of Oregon state law
regarding overtime, lunch and work breaks, that it failed to pay
all wages due to the Companys Oregon employees, and
various contract claims that it promised but failed to pay
overtime. Pucci sought to represent a class of all
present and former executive assistants, inside/outside managers
and account managers employed by the Company within the six year
period prior to the filing of the complaint as to the contract
claims, and three years as to the statutory claims, and sought
class certification, payments for all unpaid wages under Oregon
law, statutory and civil penalties, costs and disbursements,
pre- and post-judgment interest in the amount of 9%per
annum and attorneys fees. On July25, 2002, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class
certification and on July31, 2002, the Company filed its
motion for summary judgment. On January15, 2003, the court
orally granted its motion for summary judgment in part, ruling
that the plaintiffs were prevented from recovering overtime
payments at the rate of time and a half, but stated
that the plaintiffs may recover straight-time to the
extent plaintiffs could prove purported class members worked in
excess of forty hours in a work week but were not paid for such
time worked. The court denied the Companys motion for
summary judgment on the remaining claims. On October10, 2003, the court issued an opinion letter
stating that it would certify a class and not permit an
interlocutory appeal, and issued its written order to that
effect on December9, 2003. On March17, 2005, Pucci class members Jeremy Chess
and Chad Clemmons filed an amended class action complaint
entitled Jeremy Chess etal.v.
Rent-A-Center, Inc.
etal, alleging similar claims as the plaintiffs in
Pucci and seeking unspecified statutory and contractual
damages and penalties, as well as injunctive relief. The
Chess plaintiffs sought to represent a class of all
present and former executive assistants, inside/outside managers
and account managers employed by the Company within the six year
period prior to the filing of the complaint as to the contract
claims, and three years as to the statutory claims. On
April15, 2005, the Company filed pleadings removing the
case to the federal court for the District of Oregon under the
ClassAction Fairness Act of 2005. The Chess
plaintiffs were represented by the same attorneys as the
Pucci plaintiffs. 70 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued On June23, 2005, the Company reached an agreement in
principle to settle the claims in Pucci and Chess.
Under the settlement, the Company agreed to pay
$175million to settle all class claims, including
payments to the class and its representatives, the
plaintiffs attorneys fees and administrative costs,
subject to adjustment based upon the size of the class. The
final class included approximately 777 current and former
account managers, inside/outside managers, and executive
assistant managers that were employed by the Company in Oregon.
In connection therewith, the plaintiffs counsel in the
Pucci and Chess matters filed a new class action
complaint in Federal court entitled Clemmons
etalv.
Rent-A-Center Inc.,
etal, alleging substantially similar claims and
seeking similar damages as in Pucci and Chess
through the date of filing. The parties used the Clemmons
case to consolidate the Pucci and Chess
claims, and facilitate final approval, administration and
distribution of the settlement. Notice of the settlement was
mailed to class members on or about November15, 2005 and
no class member objected to the settlement or sought exclusion
from the class. As a result of the prospective settlement 19million was reserved with respect to this matter as of
December31, 2005, covering the anticipated settlement and
our attorneys fees. On January20, 2006, the Pucci
and Clemmons courts approved the final settlement,
entered a final judgment and dismissed the respective cases. The
Company funded the settlement in February 2006. Jeremy Burdusis, etal. v.
Rent-A-Center, Inc.,
etal./ Israel French, etal.v.
Rent-A-Center, Inc.
These matters pending in Los Angeles, California were filed on
October23, 2001, and October30, 2001, respectively,
and allege similar violations of the wage and hour laws of
California as those in Pucci. The same law firm in
Pucci is seeking to represent the purported class in
Burdusis. The Burdusis and French
proceedings are pending before the same judge in California.
On March24, 2003, the Burdusis court denied the
plaintiffs motion for class certification in that case,
which the Company views as a favorable development in that
proceeding. On April25, 2003, the plaintiffs in
Burdusis filed a notice of appeal of that ruling, and on
May8, 2003, the Burdusis court, at the
Companys request, stayed further proceedings in
Burdusis and French pending the resolution on
appeal of the courts denial of class certification in
Burdusis. In June 2004, the Burdusis plaintiffs
filed their appellate brief. The Companys response brief
was filed in September 2004, and the Burdusis plaintiffs
filed their reply in October 2004. On February9, 2005, the
California Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the trial
courts denial of class certification in Burdusis
and directed the trial court to reconsider its ruling in
light of two other recent appellate court decisions, including
the opinions of the California Supreme Court in Sav-On Drugs
Stores, Inc.v. Superior Court, and of the California
appeals court in Bellv. Farmers Insurance Exchange.
After remand, the plaintiffs filed a motion with the trial court
seeking to remove from the case the trial court judge who
previously denied their motion for class certification. The
trial court denied the motion. In response, plaintiffs
filed a petition for writ of mandate with the California Court
of Appeals requesting review of the trial courts decision.
The California Court of Appeals heard oral arguments in this
matter on August29, 2005, and ruled against the
plaintiffs, denying the requested relief. The case is now being
returned to the trial court as previously ordered. On October30, 2003, the plaintiffs counsel in
Burdusis and French filed a new non-class lawsuit
in Orange County, California entitled Kris Corso,
etal.v.
Rent-A-Center, Inc.
The plaintiffs counsel later amended this complaint to add
additional plaintiffs, totaling approximately 339 individuals.
The claims made are substantially the same as those in
Burdusis. On January16, 2004, the Company filed a
demurrer to the complaint, arguing, among other things, that the
plaintiffs in Corso were misjoined. On February19,
2004, the court granted the Companys demurrer on the
misjoinder argument, with leave for the plaintiffs to replead.
On March8, 2004, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint
in Corso, increasing the number of plaintiffs to
approximately 400. The claims in the amended complaint are
substantially the same as those in Burdusis. The Company
filed a demurrer with respect to the amended complaint on
April12, 2004, which the court granted on May6,
2004. However, the court allowed the plaintiffs to again replead
the action on a representative basis, which they did on
May26, 2004. The Company subsequently filed a demurrer
with respect to the newly repled action, which the court granted
on August12, 2004. The court subsequently stayed the
Corso matter pending the outcome of the Burdusis
matter. On March16, 2005, the court lifted the stay
and on April12, 2005, the 71 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued Company answered the amended complaint. Discovery is now
proceeding. On January30, 2006, the Corso Court
heard a motion to coordinate Corso with the Burdusis
and French actions. The Corso court
recommended that Corso be coordinated with the other
actions before the judge in the Burdusis and
French matters. The Judicial Council has yet to act on
the recommendation. The Company believes the claims asserted in Burdusis, French
and Corso are without merit and intends to vigorously
oppose each of these cases. The Company cannot assure you,
however, that it will be found to have no liability in these
matters. As of December31, 2005, the Company operated 150
stores in California. Kevin Rose, etal. v.
Rent-A-Center, Inc.
etal. This matter pending in Clark County, Washington
was filed on June26, 2001, and alleges similar violations
of the wage and hour laws of Washington as those in
Pucci. The same law firm who represented the class in
Pucci sought to represent the purported class in this
matter. On May14, 2003, the Rose court denied the
plaintiffs motion for class certification in that case. On
June3, 2003, the plaintiffs in Rose filed a notice
of appeal, which was subsequently denied. Following the denial
by the Court of Appeals, the plaintiffs counsel filed 14
county-wide putative class actions in Washington with
substantially the same claims as in Rose. In April 2005,
the plaintiffs counsel filed another putative county-wide
lawsuit and subsequently the plaintiffs counsel filed
another putative state-wide lawsuit in federal court in
Washington, bringing the total to 16. The purported classes in
the county-wide class actions ranged from approximately 20
individuals to approximately 100 individuals. In November 2005, the Company reached an agreement in principle
to settle for $125million all of the pending lawsuits and
related matters bought by the plaintiffs counsel in
Washington on an agreed state-wide class basis. In connection
therewith, the parties agreed to seek class settlement in the
Superior Court of Yakima County, Washington, where one of the
putative county-wide class actions, Madrigal
etal.v.
Rent-A-Center, is
pending. On January13, 2006, the court in Madrigal
preliminarily approved the class settlement. The class
consists of approximately 1,300 class members, and notice of
settlement has now been sent. Objections to the settlement are
due March15, 2006, and a final approval hearing before the
court is scheduled for April21, 2006. Accordingly, at
December31, 2005, approximately $13million was
reserved to fund the prospective settlement as well as the
Companys attorneys fees. While the Company believes that the terms of the prospective
settlement are fair, there can be no assurance that the
settlement, if completed, will be finally approved by the court
in its present form. ColorTyme Guarantee. ColorTyme is a party to an agreement
with Wells Fargo Foothill, Inc., who provides $500million
in aggregate financing to qualifying franchisees of ColorTyme
generally of up to five times their average monthly revenues.
Under the Wells Fargo agreement, upon an event of default by the
franchisee under agreements governing this financing and upon
the occurrence of certain other events, Wells Fargo can assign
the loans and the collateral securing such loans to ColorTyme,
with ColorTyme paying the outstanding debt to Wells Fargo and
then succeeding to the rights of Wells Fargo under the debt
agreements, including the right to foreclose on the collateral.
The Wells Fargo agreement expires in October 2006. Although the
Company believes it will be able to renew its existing agreement
or find other financing arrangements, there can be no assurance
that it will not need to fund the foregoing guarantee upon the
expiration of the existing agreement. An additional
$200million of financing is provided by Texas Capital
Bank, National Association under an agreement similar to the
Wells Fargo financing.
Rent-A-Center East
guarantees the obligations of ColorTyme under each of these
agreements, excluding the effects of any amounts that could be
recovered under collateralization provisions, up to a maximum
amount of $700million, of which $303million was
outstanding as of December31, 2005. Mark E. Speese,
Rent-A-Centers
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, is a passive
investor in Texas Capital Bank, owning less than 1% of its
outstanding equity. 72 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued NoteN Stock Based Compensation Rent-A-Centers
Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan the
Plan for the benefit of certain employees,
consultants and directors provides the Board of Directors broad
discretion in creating equity incentives. Under the Plan,
14,562,865shares of
Rent-A-Centers
common stock have been reserved for issuance under stock
options, stock appreciation rights or restricted stock grants.
Options granted to the Companys employees under the Plan
generally become exercisable over a period of one to four years
from the date of grant and may be exercised up to a maximum of
10years from the date of grant. Options granted to
directors are immediately exercisable. There have been no grants
of stock appreciation rights and all options have been granted
with fixed prices. At December31, 2005, there were
8,878,260shares available for issuance under the Plan, of
which 5,018,977shares were allocated to options currently
outstanding. However, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, when an
optionee leaves the Companys employ, unvested options
granted to that employee terminate and become available for
re-issuance under the Plan. Vested options not exercised within
90days from the date the optionee leaves the
Companys employ terminate and become available for
re-issuance under the Plan. Information with respect to stock option activity related to the
Plan is as follows

The option data above does not include the 554,102 stock
options, with an approximate fair value of $61million,
assumed as part of the purchase price for the acquisition of
Rent Rite, Inc. in May of 2004. At December31, 2005, the
weighted average remaining contractual life and exercise price
for the Rent Rite options, all of which are exercisable, were
401years and $3062, respectively. No options were issued
to non-employees during 2005, 2004 or 2003. On January31, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors of
Rent-A-Center approved
the issuance of long-term incentive awards to certain key
employees under the Plan. The awards were issued as equity
awards which were separated into three distinct tranches,
i50% of which were issued in options to purchase
Rent-A-Centers
common stock vesting ratably over a four year period,
ii25% of which were issued in restricted stock units
which will vest upon the employees completion of three
years of continuous employment with the Company from
January31, 2006, iii25% of which were issued in
restricted stock units subject to performance-based vesting
based upon the Companys achievement of a specified three
year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization EBITDA. The Company does not expect this issuance
under the Plan to have a significant impact on its results of
operations or financial condition. NoteO Employee Benefit Plan Rent-A-Center sponsors
a defined contribution pension plan under Section401k of
the Internal Revenue Code for all employees who have completed
at least three months of service. Employees may elect to
contribute up to 50% of their eligible compensation on a pre-tax
basis, subject to limitations.
Rent-A-Center may make
discretionary matching contributions to the 401k plan. During
2005, 2004 and 2003,
Rent-A-Center made
matching cash contributions of $44million 42million, and $42million, respectively, which
represents 50% of the employees contributions to the
401k plan up to an amount not to exceed 4% of each
employees respective compensation. Employees are permitted
to elect to purchase
Rent-A-Center common
stock as part of their 401k plan. As of December31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, 110%, 160% and 190%, respectively, of
the total plan assets consisted of
Rent-A-Centers
common stock. NoteP Fair Value of Financial
Instruments The Companys financial instruments include cash and cash
equivalents, receivables, payables, senior debt, and
subordinated notes payable. The carrying amount of cash and cash
equivalents, receivables and payables approximates fair value at
December31, 2005 and 2004, because of the short maturities
of these instruments. The Companys senior debt is variable
rate debt that re-prices frequently and entails no significant
change in credit risk, and as a result, fair value approximates
carrying value. The fair value of the subordinated notes payable
is estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis using
interest rates currently offered for loans with similar terms to
borrowers of similar credit quality. At December31, 2005,
the fair value 74 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued of the subordinated notes was $2910million, which is
$90million below their carrying value of
$3000million. NoteQ Stock Repurchase Plan On October24, 2003,
Rent-A-Center announced
that its Board of Directors had authorized a common stock
repurchase program, permitting
Rent-A-Center to
purchase, from time to time, in the open market and privately
negotiated transactions, up to an aggregate of
$1000million of its common stock. Over a period of time,
Rent-A-Centers
Board of Directors increased the authorization for stock
repurchases under its common stock repurchase program to
$4000million. As of December31, 2005,
Rent-A-Center had
purchased a total of 14,426,000shares of its common stock
for an aggregate of $3561million under this common stock
repurchase program, of which 1,816,100shares were
repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2005 for approximately
$345million. NoteR Earnings Per Common Share Summarized basic and diluted earnings per common share were
