SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the Companys
consolidated financial statements is set forth below Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of Sun Hydraulics and its
direct and indirect subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are
eliminated in consolidation. The Company uses the equity method of accounting to account for its
investments in Sun China and WhiteOak. The Company does not have a majority ownership in or
exercise control over either of the entities. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company currently only applies judgment and estimates, which may have a material effect on the
eventual outcome of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, for impairment of long-lived
assets, accounts receivable, inventory, goodwill and accruals. The following explains the basis
and the procedure for each account where judgment and estimates are applied. Revenue Recognition The Company reports revenues, net of sales incentives, when title passes and risk of loss transfers
to the customer. The effect of material non-recurring events is provided for when they become
known. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards FAS No144, Accounting for
Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets FAS 144, long-lived assets, such as property and
equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Recoverability of the asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future
net cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
exceeds its fair market value. The Company assesses the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets not subject to
amortization under FAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets FAS 142. See Goodwill
below. 33 Table of Contents Accounts Receivable The Company sells to most of its customers on a recurring basis, primarily through distributors
with which the Company maintains long-term relationships. As a result, bad debt experience has not
been material. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined on a specific identification
basis by a review of those accounts that are significantly in arrears. There can be no assurance
that a distributor or a large direct sale customer with overdue accounts receivable balances will
not develop financial difficulties and default on payment. See the
Consolidated Balance Sheets for
allowance amounts. Inventory The Company offers a wide variety of standard products and as a matter of policy does not
discontinue products. On an ongoing basis, component parts found to be obsolete through design or
process changes are disposed of and charged to material cost. The Company reviews on-hand balances
of products and component parts against specific criteria. Products and component parts without
usage or that have excess quantities on hand are evaluated. An inventory reserve is then
established for the full inventory carrying value of those products and component parts deemed to
be obsolete or slow moving. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for inventory reserve amounts. Goodwill The Company acquired its Korean operations in September1998 using the purchase method. As a
result, goodwill is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. A valuation based on the cash
flow method was performed at December31, 2005 and December25, 2004. It was determined that the
value of the goodwill was not impaired. There is no assurance that the value of the acquired
company will not decrease in the future due to changing business conditions. See Note 8 to the
Financial Statements for goodwill amounts. Accruals The Company makes estimates related to certain employee benefits and miscellaneous accruals.
Estimates for employee benefit accruals are based on information received from plan administrators
in conjunction with managements assessments of estimated liabilities related to workers
compensation, health care benefits and annual contributions to an employee stock ownership plan
ESOP, established in 2004 as part of the Companys retirement plan. Estimates for
miscellaneous accruals are based on managements assessment of estimated liabilities for costs
incurred. As of July1, 2003, the Company accrues for health care benefit costs under a self-funded plan
utilizing estimates provided by a third party administrator and insurance company. The Company
purchases re-insurance for both specific and aggregate stop losses on claims that exceed $75,000 on
an individual basis and approximately $38million on an aggregate basis. Stock Split On June10, 2005, the Company declared a three-for-two stock split, effected in the form of a 50%
stock dividend, to shareholders of record on June30, 2005, payable on July15, 2005. The Company
issued approximately 3,600,000 shares of common stock as a result of the stock split. The effect
of the stock split on outstanding shares, earnings per share and dividends per share has been
retroactively applied to all periods presented. Reclassification Certain amounts shown in the 2004 and 2003 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified
to conform to the 2005 presentation. Management Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. 34 Table of Contents 52-53 Week Fiscal Year The Company reports on a fiscal year that ends on the Saturday closest to December31st. Each
quarter generally consists of two 4-week periods and one 5-week period. As a result of the 2005
fiscal year ending December31, 2005, the quarter-ended April2, 2005 consisted of one 4-week
period and two 5-week periods, resulting in a 53-week year. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity
of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined on a first-in,
first-out basis. Obsolete and slow moving inventory is evaluated and reserves are established
based on specific criteria determined by management. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Expenditures for repairs and improvements that
significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized.
Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight
line method over the following useful lives   
Years   Computer equipment
3 - 5
Machinery and equipment
4 - 12
Furniture and fixtures
4 - 10
Leasehold and land improvements
5 - 15
Buildings
40
Gains or losses on the retirement, sale, or disposition of plant, property, and equipment are
reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the period in which the assets are taken
out of service. Valuation Assessment of Long-Lived Assets Management periodically evaluates long-lived assets for potential impairment and will provide for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets
may not be fully recoverable. Assets are reviewed for utilization on a monthly basis by management
in conjunction with employees who work directly with the assets. Goodwill Goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisition over the fair value of
the net assets acquired and other acquisition costs, is carried at cost. Effective January1,
2002, the Company adopted FAS 142. Under FAS 142, goodwill is no longer subject to amortization.
Instead, FAS 142 requires goodwill to be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more
frequently if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. Other Assets Other assets consist of equity investments in the Companys joint ventures in China and WhiteOak.
The equity investments were recorded at cost and have been adjusted for investment income or loss
and dividend distributions for each quarterly period since their origin. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized when products are shipped and title to the products is passed to the customer.
Sales incentives are granted to customers based upon the volume of purchases. These sales
incentives are recorded at the time of sales as a reduction of gross sales. 35 Table of Contents Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs billed to distributors and customers are recorded in revenue. Shipping
costs incurred by the Company are recorded in cost of goods sold. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions The Company follows the translation policy provided by FAS No52, Foreign Currency Translation.
The Pound Sterling is the functional currency of Sun Ltd. The Euro is the functional currency of
Sun GmbH. The South Korean Won is the functional currency of Sun Korea. The U.S. Dollar is the
functional currency for Sun Hydraulics and the reporting currency for the consolidated group. The
assets and liabilities of Sun Ltd., Sun GmbH, and Sun Korea are translated at the exchange rate in
effect at the balance sheet date, and income and expense items are translated at the average annual
rate of exchange for the period. The resulting unrealized translation gains and losses are
included as a component of shareholders equity designated as accumulated other comprehensive
income. Realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in
miscellaneous incomeexpense. Income Taxes The Company follows the income tax policy provided by FAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes
FAS 109. This Statement provides for a liability approach under which deferred income taxes are
provided for based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the taxes
become payable. These differences result from items reported differently for financial reporting
and income tax purposes, primarily depreciation, accrued expenses and reserves. Stock-Based Compensation The Company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of FAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment to FAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation FAS 148, and has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion APBNo.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations in accounting for its
employee stock options. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of employee stock options equals
the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recorded. If the company had elected to recognize compensation expense for stock options based on the fair
value at grant date, consistent with the method prescribed by FAS No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation FAS 123, net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to
the pro forma amounts below. The pro forma amounts were determined using the Black-Scholes
valuation model with weighted average assumptions as set forth below. 36 Table of Contents

fair value of stock options is amortized to expense over the vesting period and additional options
may be granted in future years. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.   3.
ACQUISITIONS On June28, 2005, Sun Hydraulics acquired shares of common stock representing 40% of the
outstanding shares of WhiteOak. WhiteOak designs and produces electronic amplifiers and other
control products. The Company, together with WhiteOak, will co-develop products to be used in and
in conjunction with other Company products. The acquisition price paid by the Company was $400.
The excess paid over pro rata share of net assets of $270 is being classified as developed
technology and is being amortized over a period of 10years.   4.
FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged
in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation. The
following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial
instruments. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, other
current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value
based on their short-term status. The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair value, as the interest rates on the debt
approximate rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining
maturities.   5.
RESTRICTED CASH On December31, 2005 and December25, 2004, the Company had restricted cash of $413 and $462,
respectively. The restricted cash balance consisted of reserves for customs and excise taxes in
the U.K. operation. The 37 Table of Contents restricted amount was calculated as an estimate of two months of customs
and excise taxes for items coming into the Companys U.K. operations and was held with Lloyds TSB
in the U.K.   6.

A valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported is required if, based on the
weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. For the fiscal years ended 2005 and 2004, management has determined
that a valuation allowance is not required. The foreign tax credit carryforward will expire through
the year 2009. The Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, which
reflect full provision for non-U.S. income taxes, to expand its international operations. These
earnings relate to ongoing operations and, at December31, 2005,
cumulative earnings were approximately $16million.
Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. income taxes that might be payable upon
repatriation of such earnings. In the event any earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries are repatriated,
the Company will provide U.S. income taxes upon repatriation of such earnings, which will be offset
by applicable foreign tax credits, subject to certain limitations. 14. STOCK OPTION PLANS During 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Stock Option Plan the Stock Option Plan, which
provides for the grant of incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options for the purchase
of up to an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of the Companys common stock by officers, employees and
directors of the Company. Under the terms of the plan, incentive stock options may be granted to
employees at an exercise price per share of not less than the fair value per common share on the
date of the grant not less than 110% of the fair value in the case of holders of more than 10% of
the Companys voting stock. Nonqualified stock options may be granted at the discretion of the
Companys Board of Directors. The maximum term of an option may not exceed 10years, and options
become exercisable at such times and in such installments as determined by the Board of Directors. 43 Table of Contents A summary of the Companys stock option plan for the years ended December31, 2005, December25,

The weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted during 2005, 2004 and 2003
was $667, $372, and $147 per share, respectively. During 2001, the Company adopted the 2001 Restricted Stock Plan, which provides for the grant of
restricted stock of up to an aggregate of 412,500 shares of the Companys common stock to officers,
employees, consultants and directors of the Company. Under the terms of the plan, the minimum
period before any shares become non-forfeitable may not be less than six months. The market value
of the restricted stock at the date of grant was recorded as unearned compensation, a component of
shareholders equity, and is being charged to expense over
the respective vesting periods. Restricted stock expense for the years ended December31, 2005,
December25, 2004, and December27, 2003 totaled $342, $250, and $181, respectively. 44 Table of Contents On October15, 2004, the Board of Directors granted 35,634 shares of restricted stock to employees.
The restricted stock will be earned over a three year period. The restricted stock is expensed
over the vesting period at a price of $823, the stock price on October15, 2004. On December9, 2005, the Board of Directors granted 25,824 shares of restricted stock to employees.
The restricted stock will be earned over a three year period. The restricted stock is expensed
over the vesting period at a price of $1841, the stock price on December9, 2005. The grant
increased restricted shares outstanding from 230,484 at December25, 2004 to 256,672 at December
31, 2005. At December31, 2005 and December25, 2004, 161,995 and 101,061 of these shares,
respectively, were vested. During 2001, the Company adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, which became effective
August1, 2001. Most employees are eligible to participate. Employees who choose to participate
are granted an opportunity to purchase common stock at 85percent of market value on the first or
last day of the quarterly purchase period, whichever is lower. The ESPP authorizes the issuance,
and the purchase by employees, of up to 487,500 shares of common stock through payroll deductions.
No employee is allowed to buy more than $25,000 of common stock in any year, based on the market
value of the common stock at the beginning of the purchase period. Employees purchased
approximately 12,017 shares at an average price of $1472 and 20,013 shares at an average price of
$575, under the ESPP during 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December31, 2005 and December25,
2004, 411,931 and 423,948 shares, respectively, remained available to be issued through the ESPP. During 2004, the Board of Directors adopted and the shareholders approved the Nonemployee Director
Equity and Deferred Compensation Plan the Plan. Directors who are not officers of the Company
are paid $4,000 for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors, as well as each meeting
of each Board Committee on which they serve when the committee meeting is not held within one day
of a meeting of the Board of Directors. Directors receive $1,500 of the $4,000 Director fee in
shares of Company stock under the Plan. Directors also may elect under the Plan to receive all or
part of the remainder of their fees in Company stock and to defer receipt of their fees until a
subsequent year. The Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 120,000 shares of common stock.
Directors were granted 3,561 and 4,112 shares during 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December31,
2005 and December25, 2004, 112,328 and 115,889 shares, respectively, remained available to be
issued through the Plan. 15. STOCK REPURCHASE PLANS In December2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $20million
of Company stock, to be completed no later than January15, 2007. The stock purchases will be made
in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Market purchases will be made
subject to restrictions relating to volume, price and timing in an effort to minimize the impact of
the purchases on the market for the Companys securities. The amount of the stock repurchases was
set based upon the anticipated number of shares that will be required to fund the Companys ESOP,
and employee stock purchase plan, through fiscal year 2006. As of December31, 2005, the Company
had repurchased 82,500 shares on the open market at an average cost of $1887 per share. Of the

average cost of $1916 per share. Total purchases under the plan have amounted to $18million. In November2004, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $25million
of Company stock, to be completed no later than January15, 2006. The amount of the stock
repurchases was set based upon the anticipated number of shares that were required to fund the
Companys ESOP, and employee stock purchase plan, through fiscal year 2005. The Company purchased
8,700 shares at an average cost of $952 per share and 2,700 shares at an average cost of $980 per
share for the periods ending December25, 2004 and December31, 2005, respectively. The stock
purchases were made in the open market. Market purchases were made subject to restrictions relating
to volume, price and timing in an effort to minimize the impact of the purchases on the market for
the Companys securities. All shares were retired during the year of purchase. 45 Table of Contents 16. EARNINGS PER SHARE The following table represents the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share as

United States employees. Employer contributions under the retirement plan amounted to
approximately $2,205, $2,346, and $686 during 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The Company provides supplemental pension benefits to its employees of foreign operations in
addition to mandatory benefits included in local country payroll tax statutes. These supplemental
pension benefits amounted to approximately $437, $437, and $266 during 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively. In June2004, the Companys Board of Directors approved the establishment of an Employee Stock
Ownership Plan ESOP as the discretionary match portion of its 401k retirement plan. Prior to
2004, discretionary matches to the 401k plan were made in cash. The Company contributes to the
ESOP for all eligible United States employees. Under the ESOP, which is 100% company funded, the
Company allocates common stock to each participants account. The allocation is generally a
percentage of a participants compensation as determined by the Board of Directors on an annual
basis. The ESOP is accounted for under Statement of Position 93-6 Employers Accounting for
Employee Stock Ownership Plans. In September2004, the Company made an initial one-time contribution of 48,000 shares of its common
stock to the ESOP. The Company made annual contributions to the ESOP of 57,746 shares and 109,935
shares in January2006 and January2005, related to fiscal year 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Contributions were based on 2005 and 2004 compensation. All shares receive regular quarterly
dividends payable to the ESOP to cover plan expenses. The Company incurred compensation expense under the ESOP of approximately $1,180 and $1,572 during
2005 and 2004, respectively. There was no discretionary match to the 401k in 2003. Shares contributed to the ESOP are restricted for one year. Participants may then sell their
shares to enable diversification within their individual 401k accounts. The Company does not
have any repurchase obligations under the ESOP. During 2005, the Company awarded deferred cash bonuses to key employees of its foreign operations.
The deferred cash bonuses are similar to stock appreciation rights, in that such bonuses are tied
to the value of the 46 Table of Contents Companys common stock. Awards are recognized over the deferral period as
variable plan awards. The Company recognized approximately $181 of compensation expense in 2005
related to the awards. 18. SEGMENT REPORTING The individual subsidiaries comprising the Company operate predominantly in a single industry as
manufacturers and distributors of hydraulic components. The Company is multinational with
operations in the United States, and subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Germany, Korea, and
France. Amounts for France, due to their immateriality, are included with the U.S. In computing
operating profit for the foreign subsidiaries, no allocations of general corporate expenses have
been made. Management bases its financial decisions by the geographical location of its
operations. Identifiable assets of the foreign subsidiaries are those assets related to the operation of those
companies. United States assets consist of all other operating assets of the Company. Segment

INSURANCE On July1, 2003, the Company changed its group health insurance plan that covers
U.S. employees and their families from a fully-insured policy to a self-funded plan. The Company
purchases re-insurance for both specific and aggregate stop losses on claims that exceed $75,000 on
an individual basis and approximately $38million on an aggregate basis. The Company records a
liability for all unresolved claims at the anticipated cost to the Company at the end of the period
based on the estimates provided by a third party administrator and insurance company, plus an
estimate for amounts incurred but not recorded. The Company believes it has adequate reserves for
all self-insurance claims. 20. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In November2004, the FASB issued FAS No151 FAS 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No.
43, Chapter4. The amendments made by FAS 151 clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials spoilageshould be recognized as
current-period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based
on the normal capacity of the production facilities. While FAS 151 enhances Accounting Research
Bulletin No43, Restatement and Revision of Accounting Research Bulletins, and clarifies the
accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted
material spoilage, the statement also removes inconsistencies between ARB 43 and International
Accounting Standards No2 IAS 2 and amends ARB 43 to clarify that abnormal amounts of costs
should be recognized as period costs. Under some circumstances, according to ARB 43, the above
listed costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges. FAS 151 requires
these items be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion
of so abnormal and requires allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion. This standard will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after
June15, 2005. The impact of the adoption of FAS 151 on the Companys reported operating results,
financial position and existing financial statement disclosure is not expected to be material. In December, 2004, the FASB issued FAS No123 revised 2004 FAS 123R, Share-Based Payment,
which is a revision of FAS 123. FAS 123R supersedes APB 25 and FAS 123, and amends FAS No95,
Statement of Cash Flows. This Statement requires entities to recognize the cost of employee
services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value
of those awards with limited exceptions. This Statement eliminates the alternative to use APB
25s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in FAS 123 as originally issued. Under
APB 25, issuing stock options to employees at or above fair value generally resulted in no
recognition of compensation cost. FAS 123R also requires that the Company estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest
and to revise the estimate as the actual forfeitures differ from the estimate. This standard is
effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after June15, 2005. FAS 123R requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost
be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow, thus reducing net
operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in the periods after the effective
date. The Company cannot estimate what these amounts will be in the future because they depend on,
among other things, when employees exercise stock options. The Company currently follows the disclosure only provisions of FAS 148, and has elected to follow
APB 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options. The Company uses
the Black-Scholes formula 48 Table of Contents to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees for
disclosure purposes. FAS 123R requires that the Company use the valuation technique that best
fits the circumstances. The Company currently expects to use the modified-prospective method whereby compensation cost for
the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered that are
outstanding as of the adoption date will be recognized over the remaining service period. The
compensation cost for that portion of awards will be based on the grant-date fair value of those
awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures using the Black-Scholes valuation model. All new
awards and awards that are modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the adoption date will be
accounted for under the provisions of FAS 123R. The amounts reflected in Note 2 to the Financial
Statements, are anticipated to approximate the effect of the adoption of this Statement.
Additionally, the Company will recognize compensation expense related to the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, which has not previously been recorded. 49 Table of Contents Item 1. BUSINESS

effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15e
and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended as of the end of the period
covered by this report, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective
and are designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the necessary time periods. Our disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of

Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. There were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the
quarter ended December31, 2005, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. The
Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that   
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company   
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded, as necessary, to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and   
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this evaluation under the Internal Control Integrated Framework, management
concluded that the internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2005. 50 Table of Contents Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005 has been audited by Grant Thornton LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Sun Hydraulics Corporation We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting, that Sun Hydraulics Corporation a Florida Corporation
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Sun Hydraulics Corporations management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Sun Hydraulics Corporation maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by COSO. Also in our opinion, Sun Hydraulics Corporation maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Sun Hydraulics Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2005 and December25, 2004, and the related statements of
operations, shareholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the two years
in the period ended December31, 2005, and our report dated March6, 2006 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those financial statements. s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP Tampa, Florida
