REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Atlantic Data Services, Inc In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Atlantic
Data Services, Inc and its subsidiary the Company at March 31, 2001, 2000
and 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended March 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

ATLANTIC DATA SERVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
March 31, 2001
1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Atlantic Data Services, Inc. ADS or the Company, provides information
technology IT strategy consulting and systems integration services to
customers exclusively in the financial services industry, primarily banks. The
Company offers IT solutions to the business challenges faced by financial
services companies through our in-depth financial services experience,
technological expertise and project management skills. The Company service
offerings are organized around four practice areas: e-Business, Customer
Relationship Management CRM, IT Strategy and Consulting, and Conversions and
Consolidations. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Atlantic Data
Services, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, ADS Securities Corp.
collectively the Company. All intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original
maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents
consist of money market accounts and repurchase agreements, which are
collateralized by U.S. Treasury Securities and controlled by major financial
institutions. These investments are subject to minimal credit and market risk.
At March 31, 2001 and 2000, cash equivalents were comprised of money market
funds totaling approximately $31,993,000 and $31,586,000, respectively, and
repurchase agreements totaling approximately $4,268,000 and $6,627,000,
respectively. At March 31, 2001 and 2000, cash equivalents are classified as
available-for-sale and recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk
consist primarily of cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The risk with
respect to cash equivalents is minimized by the Company policies in which
investments have relatively short maturities and are only placed with highly
rated issuers. A significant portion of the Company revenues and accounts
receivable are derived from services provided to banks and other financial
institutions. The risk with respect to accounts receivable is minimized by
creditworthiness of the Company customers and the Company credit and
collection policies. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers, generally does not require collateral, and maintains allowances for
potential credit losses which, when realized, have been within the range of
management expectations.
Revenue Recognition
The Company primarily derives its revenue from consulting services under time
and material billing arrangements. Under these arrangements, revenue is
recognized as the services are provided. Deferred revenue pertains to time and
material billing arrangements and represents cash collected in advance of the
performance of services.                    22
23
Revenue on fixed price contracts is recognized using the percentage of
completion method of accounting and is adjusted monthly for the cumulative
impact of any revision in estimates. The Company determines the percentage of
completion of its contracts by comparing costs incurred to date to total
estimated costs. Contract costs include all direct labor and expenses related to
the contract performance. Losses, if any, are provided for in the period in
which the loss is determined. Billings in excess of costs and estimated
earnings, represents billings in excess of revenues recognized.
Included in revenues for the years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 are
reimbursable contract-related travel and entertainment expenses of $5,777,000 5,517,000 and $9,413,000, respectively, which are separately billed to
customers.
In the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company adopted Staff
Accounting Bulletin 101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition, which was issued by
the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC in December 1999. SAB 101
outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and it
provides guidance for presentation and disclosure of revenue recognition
policies in financial statements filed with the SEC. Adoption of SAB 101 had no
material impact on ADS' reported revenues and results of operations.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less depreciation. Depreciation
expense is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets. When assets are sold or retired, the related costs
and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting
gain or loss is reflected in operations.
Leases
Leases are recorded as capital or operating leases. Any lease where
substantially all of the benefits and risks related to the ownership of the
leased asset are transferred to the lessee, as defined by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, is accounted for
as if the asset was acquired and as if the obligation were assumed as of the
date of the lease. All other leases are recorded as operating leases, whereby
the related costs are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the lesser
of the lease term or the useful life of the lease.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with
an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of the
grant. The Company accounts for stock options granted to employees in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees and related interpretations, and applies the disclosure only
provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation see Note
7.
Segment Information
The Company follows SFAS No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 prescribes the use of the management
approach whereby the Company reportable segments are established based on the
internal reporting that is used by management for making operating decisions and
assessing performance. Also required by SFAS No. 131 are disclosures about
products and services, geographic areas and major customers see Note 11.                    23
24
Earnings per Common Share
The Company follows SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. SFAS No. 128 requires
the presentation of two amounts, basic earnings per share and diluted earnings
per share. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock and special common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the
weighted average number of common stock and special common stock outstanding
during the period, plus the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents.
Income Taxes
In accordance with FAS 109, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected consequences of temporary differences between the
financial statement basis and tax basis of the Company assets and liabilities.
A deferred tax valuation allowance is established if, in management opinion,
it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the Company deferred tax
assets will not be realized.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
