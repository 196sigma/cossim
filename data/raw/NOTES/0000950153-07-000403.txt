Item8 Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data of this Annual Report.   Our net sales, gross profit and operating income are generally
lower in the first quarter of the year as compared to the fourth
quarter of the preceding year primarily due to the combined
effect of holidays in the U.S. and Asia. Semiconductor companies
in the U.S.generally reduce their production during the
holidays at the end of December which results in a significant
decrease in orders for packaging and test services during the
first two weeks of January. In addition, we typically close some
of our factories in Asia for local holidays in January and
February.   During the first quarter of 2005, we recorded a charge of
$500million related to the mold compound litigation.
During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded a gain of
$44million in connection with the sale of Amkor Test
Services, a specialty test operation.   The calculation of basic and diluted per share amounts for each
quarter is based on the weighted average shares outstanding for
that period; consequently, the sum of the quarters may not
necessarily be equal to the full year basic and diluted net
income loss per share.

and Capital Resources   We generated net income of $1701million for the year
ended December31, 2006. This compares to a net loss for
the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004 of
$1372million and $45million, respectively. Our
operating activities provided cash totaling $5236million
in 2006, $972million in 2005 and $2192million in
2004. However, in 2005 and 2004, cash flow from operating
activities was insufficient to fully cover cash used for
investing activities. Investing activities during these periods
were primarily for capital expenditures for additional
processing capacity to service anticipated customer demand and
business acquisitions to fuel future growth. The cash shortfall
was covered by incurring additional indebtedness. We have taken
several steps to strengthen our liquidity. In May 2006, we
issued $400million of 925%senior notes due June
2016 and $190million of 25%senior subordinated
convertible notes due May 2011 to refinance existing
indebtedness. After deducting fees to the underwriter, the net
proceeds of senior notes due June 2016 were used in connection
with the tender offer to repurchase the senior notes due
February 2008 for which $3523million notes were tendered
and repurchased along with payments of $202million for
tender premiums and other retirement costs and $91million
for accrued interest. The remaining proceeds of
$109million increased our cash on hand. The senior
subordinated convertible notes due May 2011 refinanced the
majority of our 105%senior subordinated notes due May
2009. After deducting fees to the underwriter, the net proceeds
of the senior subordinated notes due May 2011 were used in
connection with a partial call of the senior subordinated notes
due May 2009 for which $1781million of notes were
repurchased along with payments of $31million for call
premiums and $31million for accrued interest. We also   46 Table of Contents   repaid $1320million, from cash on hand, of our
575%convertible subordinated notes due June 2006. We plan
to use existing cash resources to retire the remaining
$1424million in 5% convertible notes at maturity in March
2007.   We have a significant level of debt, with $2,0053million
outstanding at December31, 2006, of which
$1854million is current. The terms of such debt require
significant scheduled principal payments in the coming years,
including $1854million in 2007, $1095million in
2008, $337million in 2009, $3119million in 2010,
$4396million in 2011 and $9252million thereafter.
The interest payments required on our debt are also substantial.
For example, for the year ended December31, 2006, we paid
$1721million of interest. See Capital Additions
and Contractual Obligations below for a summary of
principal and interest payments.   We were in compliance with all debt covenants at
December31, 2006 and expect to remain in compliance with
these covenants through December31, 2007.   We operate in a capital intensive industry. Servicing our
current and future customers requires that we incur significant
operating expenses and continue to make significant capital
expenditures, which are generally made in advance of the related
revenues and without any firm customer commitments. During 2006,
we had capital additions of $2990million and in 2007 we
currently anticipate making capital additions of approximately
$250 to $300million, which estimate is subject to
adjustment based on business conditions. Our 2007 capital
additions budget remains focused on strategic growth areas of
wafer level processing, testing and flip chip packaging.   The source of funds for our operations, including making capital
expenditures and servicing principal and interest obligations
with respect to our debt, are cash flows from our operations,
current cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under available
debt facilities, or proceeds from any additional debt or equity
financings. As of December31, 2006, we had cash and cash
equivalents of $2447million and $998million
available under our first lien senior secured revolving credit
facility.   We assess our liquidity based on our current expectations
regarding sales, operating expenses, capital spending and debt
service requirements. Based on this assessment, we believe that
our cash flow from operating activities together with existing
cash and cash equivalents and availability under our first lien
senior secured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to
fund our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service
requirements through December31, 2007, including retiring
the remaining $1424million of our 50%convertible
subordinated notes at maturity in March 2007. Thereafter, our
liquidity will continue to be affected by, among other things,
the performance of our business, our capital expenditure levels
and our ability to either repay debt out of operating cash flow
or refinance debt at or prior to maturity with the proceeds of
debt or equity offerings. If our performance or access to the
capital markets differs materially from our expectations, our
liquidity may be adversely impacted.   There is no assurance that we will generate the necessary net
income or operating cash flows to meet the funding needs of our
business beyond December31, 2007 due to a variety of
factors, including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor
industry and the other factors discussed in PartI,
Item1A Risk Factors. If we are unable to do
so, our liquidity would be adversely affected and we would
consider taking a variety of actions, including: attempting to
reduce our high fixed costs for example, closing facilities and
reducing the size of our work force, curtailing or reducing
planned capital additions, raising additional equity, borrowing
additional funds, refinancing existing indebtedness or taking
other actions. There can be no assurance, however, that we will
be able to successfully take any of these actions, including
adjusting our expenses sufficiently or in a timely manner, or
raising additional equity, increasing borrowings or completing
refinancings on any terms or on terms which are acceptable to
us. Our inability to take these actions as and when necessary
would materially adversely affect our liquidity, results of
operations and financial condition.   Many of our debt agreements restrict our ability to pay
dividends. We have never paid a dividend to our shareholders and
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the
foreseeable future. We expect cash flows, if any, to be used in
the operation and expansion of our business and the repayment of
debt.   Cash
flows   Cash provided by operating activities was $5236million
for the year ended December31, 2006 compared to
$972million for the year ended December31, 2005.
Cash from operations increased by $4264million in 2006   
47 Table of Contents   principally as a result of our increase in net income
$3073million over the prior year. Similarly, free cash
flow increased by $4066million to $2078million for
the year ended December31, 2006 compared to a deficit of
free cash flow of $1988million for the year ended
December31, 2005 see below. Our free cash flow of
$2078million for the year ended December31, 2006
was used to repay debt and costs of refinancing.   Net cash provided by used in operating, investing and
financing activities from continuing operations and cash
provided by discontinued operations for the three years ended
December31, 2006 were as follows

Operating activities.Our cash flows from
operating activities for 2006 increased $4264million over
2005. This increase was primarily a result of an increase in net
income by $3073million over the prior year period as
discussed above in Results of Operations.
Adjustments to reconcile net income to cash flow from operating
activities increased by $1192million from 2005 to 2006
driven by a loss on debt retirement of $274million,
$252million increase in depreciation and amortization
expenses reflecting higher levels of capital additions,
$51million increase in loss on disposal of assets and
asset impairments, and $43million increase in stock-based
compensation due to the adoption of SFAS123R. These
increases in cash flows from operating activities are partially
offset by a reduction in deferred tax asset and liability
changes of $252million, resulting from limited movement
in deferred tax balances from 2005 to 2006 as compared with 2004
to 2005. Cash flows resulting from changes in assets and
liabilities increased by $830million during 2006 compared
with 2005. This increase in changes in assets and liabilities in
2006 is primarily attributed to a $387million increase in
unearned revenue associated with customer advance payments and a
$283million increase in pension and severance
obligations, excluding the impact of applying Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No158
Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of
SFASNo87, Employers Accounting for Pensions,
SFASNo88, Employers Accounting for
Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans
and Termination Benefits, SFASNo106,
Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other
Than Pensions, and SFASNo132R, Employers
Disclosure about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.   Investing activities.Our 2006net cash
flows used in investing activities increased by
$78million over the prior year to $3148million,
primarily due to a $200million increase in payments for
property, plant and equipment from $2959million in 2005
to $3159million in 2006. The increase is attributable to
selective capacity expansion, including the expansion of our
facilities in China and Singapore, as described above.   Financing activities.Our 2006net cash
flows used in financing activities were $1692million, as
compared to $476million provided by financing activities
for 2005. The net cash used in financing activities for the 2006
is primarily driven by the repayment of the $1320million
of our 575%convertible subordinated notes at maturity in
June 2006 as well as the debt issuance costs incurred in our May
2006 refinancing activities which are described above in
Liquidity and Capital Resources.   We provide the following supplemental data to assist our
investors and analysts in understanding our liquidity and
capital resources. Free cash flow represents net cash provided
by operating activities less investing activities related to the
acquisition of property, plant and equipment. Free cash flow is
not defined by GAAP and our definition of free cash flow may not
be comparable to similar companies and should not be considered
a substitute for cash flow measures in accordance with GAAP. We
believe free cash flow provides our investors and analysts
useful information to analyze our liquidity and capital
resources.

Instruments and Related Covenants   We now have, and for the foreseeable future will continue to
have, a significant amount of indebtedness. Our indebtedness
requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
from operations to service payments on our debt. See table
included in Capital Additions and Contractual
Obligations below. Total debt decreased to
$2,0053million at December31, 2006 from
$2,1406million at December31, 2005. Amkor
Technology, Inc. also guarantees certain debt of our
subsidiaries.   Compliance
With Debt Covenants   We were in compliance with all debt covenants contained in our
loan agreements at December31, 2006, and have met all debt
payment obligations. Additional details about our debt are
available in Note12 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item8 Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report.   On August11, 2006, we received a letter dated
August10, 2006 from U.S.Bank National Association
US Bank as trustee for the holders of our
5%Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2007,
105%Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009, 925%Senior

our financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended
June30, 2006 and that we had 60days from the date of
the letter to file our Quarterly Report on From
10-Q for the
fiscal quarter ended June30, 2006 or it would be
considered an Event of Default under the indentures
governing each of the above-listed notes.   On August11, 2006, we received a letter dated
August11, 2006 from Wells Fargo Bank National Association
Wells Fargo, as trustee for our 7125% Senior
Notes due 2011, stating that we failed to file our Quarterly
Report on
Form10-Q
for the fiscal quarter ended June30, 2006, demanding that
we immediately file such quarterly report and indicating that
unless we filed a
Form10-Q
within 60days after the date of such letter, it would
ripen into an Event of Default under the indenture
governing our 7125%Senior Notes due 2011.   If an Event of Default were to occur under any of
the notes described above, the trustees or holders of at least
25% in aggregate principal amount of such series then
outstanding could attempt to declare all related unpaid
principal and premium, if any, and accrued interest on such
series of notes then outstanding to be immediately due and
payable.   On September14, 2006, we commenced the solicitation of
consents from the holders of our 925%Senior Notes due
2016 issued in May 2006, 7125%Senior Notes due 2011,
775% Senior Notes due 2013, 925%Senior Notes due 2008,
105% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009, 5%Convertible
Subordinated Notes due 2007, and 250%Convertible Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2011 issued in May 2006.   In each case, we sought consents for a waiver of certain
defaults and events of default that may have occurred under the
indenture governing each series of notes the
Indentures from our failure to file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and deliver to the trustee
and the holders of such series of notes any reports or other
information, including our Quarterly Report on
Form10-Q
for the quarter ended June30, 2006, and the waiver of the
application of certain provisions of the Indentures.   On October6, 2006, with the filing of our Quarterly Report
on
Form10-Q
for the quarter ended June30, 2006, we cured the alleged
defaults under the Indentures and terminated the solicitation of
consents. We did not accept any of the consents for payment or
pay a consent fee to the holders of any series of notes.   49 Table of Contents   2006
Significant Financing Activities   In January 2006, Amkor Assembly Test Shanghai Co.
Ltd., a Chinese subsidiary AATS, entered into a
$150million working capital facility which bears interest
at LIBOR plus 125%, which matured in January 2007 and was
repaid from cash on hand. The borrowings to date of
$150million were used to support working capital.   In May 2006, we issued $4000million of 925%Senior
Notes due June 2016 the 2016 Notes. The Notes are
redeemable by us prior to June1, 2011 provided we pay the
holders a make-whole premium. After June1,
2011, the 2016 Notes are redeemable at specified prices. In
addition, prior to June1, 2009, we may redeem up to 35% of
the notes at a specified price with the proceeds of certain
equity offerings. After deducting fees to the underwriter, the
net proceeds were used to purchase a portion of the 925% Senior
Notes due February 2008, pay respective accrued interest and
tender premiums.   In May 2006, we issued $1900million of our 25%
Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 the 2011
Notes. The 2011 Notes are convertible into our common
stock at a price of $1459per share, subject to
adjustment. The notes are subordinated to the prior payment in
full of all of our senior subordinated debt. After deducting
fees to the underwriter, the net proceeds from the issuance of
the 2011 Notes were used to repurchase a portion of the 105%
Senior Subordinated Notes due May 2009, pay respective accrued
interest and call premiums.   2005
Significant Financing Activities   In September 2005, Amkor Technology Taiwan, Inc.
ATT, entered into a short-term interim financing
arrangement with two Taiwanese banks for NT$10billion
approximately U.S.$300million the Bridge
Loan in connection with a syndication loan with the same
group of lenders. In November 2005, ATT finalized the
NT$18billion approximately U.S.$535million
syndication loan due November 2010 the Syndication
Loan, which accrues interest at the Taiwan
90-Day
Commercial Paper Primary Market rate plus 12%. A portion of the
Syndication Loan was used to pay off the Bridge Loan. Amkor
Technology, Inc. has guaranteed the repayment of this loan.   In November 2005, we entered into a $1000million first
lien revolving credit facility available through November 2009,
with a letter of credit
sub-limit of
$250million. Interest is charged under the credit
facility at a floating rate based on the base rate in effect
from time to time plus the applicable margins which range from
00% to 05% for base rate revolving loans, or LIBOR plus 15%
to 225% for LIBOR revolving loans. There were no borrowings
outstanding on this credit facility as of December31,
2006. AmkorTechnology, Inc., along with, Unitive Inc.
Unitive and Unitive Electronics Inc.
UEI, were co-borrowers under the loan and granted
a first priority lien on substantially all of their assets,
excluding inter-company loans and the capital stock of foreign
subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries. In November
2006, Unitive and UEI were merged into Amkor. As of
December31, 2006, we had utilized $02million of the
available letter of credit
sub-limit,
and had $998million available under this facility. The
borrowing base for the revolving credit facility is based on the
valuation of our eligible accounts receivable. We incur
commitment fees on the unused amounts of the revolving credit
facility ranging from 025% to 050%, based on our liquidity.   In November 2005, we sold $1000million of our 625%
Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2013 the 2013
Notes in a private placement to James J. Kim, Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer, and certain Kim family members. The
2013 Notes are convertible into our common stock at an initial
conversion price of $749per share and are subordinated to
the prior payment in full of all of our senior and senior
subordinated debt.   Capital
Additions and Contractual Obligations   Our capital additions were $2990million for 2006. We
expect that our 2007 capital additions will be approximately
$250 to $300million, as discussed above in the
Overview. Ultimately, the amount of our 2007 capital
additions will depend on several factors including, among
others, the performance of our business, the need for additional
capacity to service anticipated customer demand and the
availability of suitable cash flow from operations or financing.

customer advances are included in non-current liabilities and
relate to supply agreements with customers that commit capacity
in exchange for customer prepayment of services. Generally
customers forfeit the prepayment if the capacity is not utilized
per contract terms.   Related
Party Transactions   In November 2005, we sold $1000million of our 625%
Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2013 in a private placement
to James J. Kim, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and
certain Kim family members. The terms were approved by a
majority of the independent members of the board of directors
and we obtained a fairness opinion from a recognized investment
banking firm.   We have entered into the following related party transactions in
the normal course of business   Mr.JooHo Kim is an employee of Amkor and a brother of
James J. Kim, our Chairman and CEO. Mr.JooHoKim
owned with his children and other Kim family members 5811% of
Anam Information Technology, Inc., a company that provided
computer hardware and software components to Amkor Technology
Korea, Inc. a subsidiary of Amkor. Mr.JooHo Kim sold all
of his shares in the fourth quarter of 2006. Other Kim family
members owned 483% as of December31, 2006. As of
September30, 2006, a decision was made to discontinue
services, and such services continue to decrease in volume. The
services provided by Anam Information Technology are subject to
competitive bid. During 2006, 2005, and 2004, purchases from
Anam Information   
51 Table of Contents   Technology, Inc. were $03million, $18million, and
$12million, respectively. Amounts due to Anam Information
Technology, Inc. at December31, 2006 and 2005 were
$0million and $03million, respectively.   Mr.JooHo Kim, together with his wife and children, own
961% of Jesung CM, a company that provides cafeteria
services to Amkor Technology Korea, Inc. The services provided
by Jesung CM are subject to competitive bid. During 2006,
2005 and 2004, purchases from Jesung CM were
$65million, $65million, and $64million
respectively. Amounts due to Jesung CM at December31,
2006 and 2005 were $05million and $05million,
respectively.   Dongan Engineering Co., Ltd. was 100% owned by JooCheon Kim, a
brother of James J. Kim, until the third quarter of 2005. There
is no longer any related party ownership. Mr.JooCheon Kim
is not an employee of Amkor. Dongan Engineering Co., Ltd.
provides construction and maintenance services to Amkor
Technology Korea, Inc. and Amkor Technology Philippines, Inc.,
both subsidiaries of Amkor. The services provided by Dongan
Engineering were subject to competitive bid. During 2005 and
2004, purchases from Dongan Engineering Co., Ltd were
$05million and $30million, respectively. Amounts
due to Dongan Engineering Co., Ltd. at December31, 2005
were not significant.   We purchase leadframe inventory from Acqutek
Semiconductor Technology Co., Ltd. James J.
Kims ownership in Acqutek Semiconductor
Technology Co., Ltd. is approximately 177%. During 2006, 2005
and 2004, purchases from Acqutek Semiconductor
Technology Co., Ltd. were $167million, $118million
and $118million, respectively. Amounts due to Acqutek
Semiconductor Technology Co., Ltd. at
December31, 2006 and 2005 were $13million and
$14million, respectively. The purchases are arms length
and on terms consistent with our non-related party vendors.   We lease office space in West Chester, Pennsylvania from trusts
related to James J. Kim. During 2006, 2005, and 2004 amounts
paid for this lease were $01million, $06million,
and $11million, respectively. We vacated a portion of
this space in connection with the move of our corporate
headquarters to Arizona and paid a lease termination fee of
$07million in the second quarter of 2005. We currently
lease approximately 2,700square feet of office space from
these trusts. The sublease income has been assigned to the
trusts as part of vacating the office space effective
July1, 2005. The lease term is for 2years, through
June30, 2007 subject to 2year renewal. Current plans
are to vacate the space in June 2007. During 2005 and 2004 our
sublease income included $03million and
$06million, respectively, from related parties.   Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   We had no off-balance sheet guarantees or other off-balance
sheet arrangements as of December31, 2006. Operating lease
commitments are included in the contractual obligations table
above.   Other
Contingencies   We refer you to Item3 Legal Proceedings for a
discussion of our contingencies related to our patent related
litigation, securities litigation, and other litigation and
legal matters. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there
exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our
results of operations in the period in which the ruling occurs.
The estimate of the potential impact from the legal proceedings,
discussed under Item3 Legal Proceedings, on
our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows,
could change in the future.   Critical
Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates   We have identified the policies below as critical to our
business operations and the understanding of our results of
operations. A summary of our significant accounting policies
used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements
appears in Note1 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item8 Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report.
Our preparation of this Annual Report on
Form10-K
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. There can be no assurance that
actual results will not differ from those estimates.   
52 Table of Contents   Revenue Recognition and Risk of Loss.We
recognize revenue from our packaging and test services when
there is evidence of a fixed arrangement, delivery has occurred
or services have been rendered, fees are fixed or determinable,
and collectibility is reasonably assured. Generally these
criteria are met and revenue is recognized upon shipment. Such
policies are consistent with the provisions in Securities and
Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting
BulletinNo104, Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements.   We do not take ownership of customer-supplied semiconductor
wafers. Title and risk of loss remains with the customer for
these materials at all times. Accordingly, the cost of the
customer-supplied materials is not included in the consolidated
financial statements.   A sales allowance is recognized in the period of sale based upon
historical experience. Additionally, provisions are made for
doubtful accounts when there is doubt as to the collectibility
of accounts receivable. Collectibility is assessed based on the
age of the balance, the customers historical payment
history and its current credit worthiness.   Provision for Income Taxes.We operate in and
file income tax returns in various U.S. and
non-U.S.jurisdictions
which are subject to examination by tax authorities. The tax
returns for open years in all jurisdictions in which we do
business are subject to change upon examination. We believe that
we have estimated and provided adequate accruals for the
probable additional taxes and related interest expense that may
ultimately result from such examinations. We believe that any
additional taxes or related interest over the amounts accrued
will not have a material effect on our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. However, resolution of
these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances
that the outcomes will be favorable. In addition, changes in the
mix of income from our foreign subsidiaries, expiration of tax
holidays and changes in tax laws or regulations could result in
increased effective tax rates in the future.   Additionally, we record the estimated future tax effects of
temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards. Generally accepted accounting principles
require companies to weigh both positive and negative evidence
in determining the need for a valuation allowance for deferred
tax assets. As a result of net losses experienced over the last
several years, we have determined that a valuation allowance
representing substantially all of our deferred tax assets was
appropriate. We will release such valuation allowance as the
related deferred tax benefits are realized on our tax returns or
once we achieve sustained profitable operations.   Valuation of Long-Lived Assets.We assess the
carrying value of long-lived assets which includes property,
plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important
which could trigger an impairment review include the following   
significant under-performance relative to expected historical or
projected future operating results   
significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset   
significant negative industry or economic trends;and   
our market capitalization relative to net book value.   Upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of
impairment, we would test such assets for a potential
impairment. The carrying value of a long-lived asset, excluding
goodwill, is considered impaired when the anticipated
undiscounted cash flows are less than the assets carrying
value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount
by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the
long-lived asset. Fair market value is determined primarily
using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate
commensurate with the risk involved.   We test goodwill for impairment in the second quarter of each
year. We review our defined reporting units, calculate the fair
value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model
and compare these fair values to the carrying value for each
reporting unit. Since separate balance sheets are not maintained
for the reporting units, we determine carrying value for each
reporting unit by assigning all assets and liabilities based on
specific identification where possible and use an allocation
method for the remaining items. In order to further support the
reasonableness of the fair value estimates prepared utilizing
the discounted cash flow valuation model, we compare   
53 Table of Contents   the combined total reporting unit values per the model to our
quoted market price at the end of the second quarter. Based on
this assessment, we determined that goodwill was not impaired.   Legal Contingencies.We are subject to certain
legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. We assess the
likelihood of any adverse judgment or outcome related to these
matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses. Our
determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for
these contingencies is based on a careful analysis of each
individual issue, often with the assistance of outside legal
counsel. We record provisions in our consolidated financial
statements for pending litigation when we determine that an
unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can
be reasonably estimated.   Our assessment of required reserves may change in the future due
to new developments in each matter. The present legislative and
litigation environment is substantially uncertain, and it is
possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows
or financial position could be materially affected by an
unfavorable outcome or settlement of our pending litigation.   Investments in Marketable Securities.We
evaluate our investments for impairment due to declines in
market value that are considered other than temporary. In the
event of a determination that a decline in market value is other
than temporary, a charge to earnings is recorded for the
unrealized loss. The stock prices of many semiconductor
companies stocks, including Dongbu Electronics, Inc. and
its competitors, are highly volatile. During 2006, we recorded
impairment charges of $32million to reduce the carrying
value of our investment in Dongbu Electronics to its market
value. As of December31, 2006, the stock price for Dongbu
Electronics had recovered resulting in $09million of
unrealized gains included in other comprehensive income. During
2005, we recorded impairment charges totaling $37million
to reduce the carrying value of our investment in Dongbu
Electronics to its market value. In determining whether declines
in market value are other than temporary, we look at market
value trends over the previous six months.   Valuation of Inventory.We order raw materials
based on customers forecasted demand. If our customers
change their forecasted requirements and we are unable to cancel
our raw materials order or if our vendors require that we order
a minimum quantity that exceeds the current forecasted demand,
we will experience a
build-up in
raw material inventory. We will either seek to recover the cost
of the materials from our customers or utilize the inventory in
production. However, we may not be successful in recovering the
cost from our customers or be able to use the inventory in
production and, accordingly, if we believe that it is probable
that we will not be able to recover such costs we adjust our
reserve estimate. Additionally, our reserve for excess and
obsolete inventory is based on forecasted demand we receive from
our customers. When a determination is made that the inventory
will not be utilized in production it is written-off and
disposed.   Property, Plant and Equipment.Property, plant
and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated by
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
depreciable assets. Depreciable lives are as follows   	
Buildings and improvements
10 to 30years
Machinery and equipment
3 to 7years
Furniture, fixtures and other
equipment
3 to 10years
Land use rights in China
50years
Cost and accumulated depreciation for property retired or
disposed of are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain
or loss is included in earnings. Expenditures for maintenance
and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.   Pension Obligation Assumptions.In pension
accounting, significant actuarial assumptions include the
discount rate and the rate of return. The weighted average
discount rate for our pension plans, all of which are located
outside the U.S., was 61%, 81% and 63% as of
December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Weighted
average discount rates were generally derived from yield curves
constructed from foreign government bonds for which the timing
and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts.
The expected rate of return was 60%, 64% and 63% as of
December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
expected rate of return assumption is based on weighted-average
expected returns for each asset class. Expected returns reflect
a combination of historical performance analysis and the
forward-looking views of the financial markets, and include
input from our actuaries. We have no control over the direction
of our investments in our Taiwanese defined   
54 Table of Contents   benefit plans as the local Labor Standards Law Fund mandates
such contributions into a cash account balance at the Central
Trust of China. The Japanese defined benefit pension plans are
non-funded plans, and as such, no assets exist related to these
plans. Our investment strategy for our Philippine defined
benefit plan is
long-term,
sustained asset growth through low to medium risk investments.
The current rate of return assumption targets an asset
allocation strategy for our Philippine plan assets of 20% to 75%
emerging market debt, 10% to 30% international equities
primarily U.S. and Europe, and 0% to 10% international
fixed-income securities. The remainder of the portfolio may
contain other investments such as short-term investments. At
December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, Philippine plan assets
included $09million, $06million and
$07million, respectively, of Amkor common stock. A third
assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase which
was 70%, 65% and 62% as of December31, 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively. Total pension expense was $57million,
$65million and $57million for the year ended
December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We expect
pension expense to be $68million for the year ended
December31, 2007.   Recently
Adopted Standards   In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued SFASNo158, which requires
the recognition of the funded status of a defined benefit
pension plan other than a multi-employer plan as an asset or
liability in the statement of financial position and the
recognition of changes in the funded status through
comprehensive income in the year in which such changes occur. We
adopted the recognition provisions of SFASNo158 and
initially applied those to the funded status of our defined
benefit pension plans as of December31, 2006. The initial
recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit pension
plans resulted in a decrease in stockholders equity of
$118million, which was net of a deferred tax benefit of
$08million.   SFASNo158 also requires that the funded status of a
plan be measured as of the date of the year-end statement of
financial position. We currently measure our funded status as of
the balance sheet date. Accordingly, the adoption of the
measurement provisions of SFASNo158 will have no
impact on our financial statements see Note13 for further
discussion.   Effective January1, 2006, we adopted
SFASNo123 revised 2004, Share-Based
Payments SFASNo123R, which
revises SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB
No25. We elected the modified prospective method
of adoption meaning that years prior to 2006 reflect stock-based
compensation expense determined pursuant to the provisions of
APB No25 see Note 3 for further discussion.   In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
BulletinNo108, Considering the Effects of Prior
Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current
Year Financial Statements
SABNo108. SABNo108
provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior
year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for
the purpose of a materiality assessment. SABNo108
establishes an approach that requires quantification of
financial statement errors based on the effects of each of the
companys balance sheet and statement of operations and the
related financial statement disclosures. Under certain
circumstances, SABNo108 permits existing public
companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying
this approach in the first year ending after November15,
2006 by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the
carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of
that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening
balance of retained earnings. Additionally, the use of the
cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure
of the nature and amount of each individual error being
corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it
arose. SABNo108 did not have an impact on our
consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations.   In November 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo151,
Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No43,
Chapter4 SFASNo151.
SFASNo151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials
spoilage should be recognized as current-period charges and
requires the allocation of fixed   
55 Table of Contents   production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity
of the production facilities. The guidance in this Statement is
effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years
beginning after June15, 2005. We adopted the provisions of
SFASNo151 on January1, 2006. The adoption of
this Statement did not have a material impact on our financial
statements.   In December 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo153,
Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an Amendment of APB Opinion
No29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions
SFASNo153. SFASNo153
eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for
nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in
paragraph21b of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No29 and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that
do not have commercial substance. SFASNo153
specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance
if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change
significantly as a result of the exchange.
SFASNo153 is effective in fiscal years beginning
after June15, 2005. We adopted the provisions of
SFASNo153 on January1, 2006. The adoption of
this statement did not have a material impact on our financial
statements.   In May 2005, the FASB issued SFASNo154,
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.
SFASNo154 replaces APB No20,
Accounting Changes and SFASNo3, Reporting
Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements
SFASNo154 and establishes
retrospective application as the required method for reporting a
change in accounting principle. SFASNo154 provides
guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a
change in accounting principle is impracticable and how to
report such a change. The reporting of a correction of an error
by restating previously issued financial statements is also
addressed. SFASNo154 is effective for accounting
changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning
after December15, 2005. We adopted the provisions of
SFASNo154 on January1, 2006.   In November 2005, FASB issued FASB Staff Position
FSP
FAS115-1/FAS124-1,
The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments
FSP 115-1/124-1. FSP 115-1/124-1 provides guidance
on determining when investments in certain debt and equity
securities are considered impaired, whether that impairment is
other-than-temporary,
and on measuring such impairment loss. FSP 115-1/124-1 also
includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition
of an
other-than-temporary
impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized
losses that have not been recognized as
other-than-temporary
impairments. This FSP is required to be applied to reporting
periods beginning after December15, 2005. We adopted the
provisions FSP 115-1/124-1 on January1, 2006. The adoption
of this FSP did not have a material impact on our financial
statements and disclosures.   Recently
Issued Standards   In February 2006, FASB issued SFAS No155, Accounting
for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments
SFASNo155, which amends
SFASNo133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities SFASNo133
and SFASNo140, Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities SFASNo140.
SFASNo155 simplifies the accounting for certain
derivatives embedded in other financial instruments by allowing
them to be accounted for as a whole if the holder elects to
account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis.
SFASNo155 also clarifies and amends certain other
provisions of SFASNo133 and SFASNo140.
SFASNo155 is effective for all financial
instruments acquired, issued or subject to a remeasurement event
occurring in fiscal years beginning after September15,
2006. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided the company has
not yet issued financial statements, including for interim
periods, for that fiscal year. We do not expect the adoption of
SFASNo155 will have a material impact on our
financial statements and disclosures.   In June 2006, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF Issue
No06-03
How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
Statement That Is, Gross Versus Net Presentation
Issue
No06-03.
Under Issue
No06-03,
a company must disclose its accounting policy regarding the
gross or net presentation of certain taxes. If taxes included in
gross revenues are significant, a company must disclose the
amount of such taxes for each period for which an income
statement is presented i.e., both interim and annual periods.
Taxes within the scope of this Issue are those that are imposed
on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction.
Taxes assessed on an entitys activities over a period of
time, such as gross receipts taxes, are not within the scope of
the issue. Issue
No06-03
is effective for the first annual or interim   
56 Table of Contents   reporting period beginning after December15, 2006. We do
not expect the adoption of Issue
No06-03
will have a material impact on our financial statements and
disclosures.   In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an
interpretation of FASB Statement No109
FINNo48, which clarifies the
accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in income tax
positions, as defined. FINNo48 seeks to reduce the
diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the
recognition and measurement related to accounting for income
taxes. FINNo48 requires that we recognize in our
consolidated financial statements, the impact of a tax position,
if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on
audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The
provisions of FINNo48 also provide guidance on
derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
accounting in interim periods, and disclosures. This
interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2006, with the cumulative effect of the change
in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to the opening
balance of retained earnings. While our analysis of the impact
of this interpretation is ongoing, we do not expect the adoption
of FINNo48 to have a material impact on the opening
balance of retained earnings upon adoption on January1,
2007.   The FASB has issued SFASNo157, Fair Value
Measurements SFASNo157, which
provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and
liabilities. The standard also responds to investors
requests for more information about 1the extent to which
companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value,
2the information used to measure fair value, and
3the effect that fair value measurements have on
earnings. SFASNo157 will apply whenever another
standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be
measured at fair value. The standard does not expand the use of
fair value to any new circumstances. SFASNo157 is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after November15, 2007, and interim periods
within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the
impact of this standard on our financial statements and
disclosures.   
Item7A.
Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Market
Risk Sensitivity   We are exposed to market risks, primarily related to foreign
currency and interest rate fluctuations. In the normal course of
business, we employ established policies and procedures to
manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values
and changes in interest rates. Our use of derivative
instruments, including forward exchange contracts, has
historically been insignificant and it is expected that our use
of derivative instruments will continue to be minimal.   Foreign
Currency Risks   Our primary exposures to foreign currency fluctuations are
associated with transactions and related assets and liabilities
denominated in Chinese renminbi, Euro, Japanese yen, Korean won,
Philippine pesos, Singapore dollar and Taiwanese dollar. The
objective in managing these foreign currency exposures is to
minimize the risk through minimizing the level of activity and
financial instruments denominated in those currencies. Our
foreign currency financial instruments primarily consist of
cash, trade receivables, investments, deferred taxes, trade
payables, accrued expenses and debt.   For an entity with various financial instruments denominated in
a foreign currency in a net asset position, an increase in the
exchange rate would result in less net assets when converted to
U.S.dollars. Conversely, for an entity with various
financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency in a net
liability position, a decrease in the exchange rate would result
in more net liabilities when converted to U.S.dollars.
Changes period over period are caused by changes in our net
asset or net liability position and changes in currency exchange
rates. Based on our portfolio of foreign currency based
financial instruments at December31, 2006 and 2005, a 20%
increase decrease   
57 Table of Contents   in the foreign currency to U.S.dollar spot exchange rate
would result in the following foreign currency risk for our
entities in a net asset liability position   As of

currency denominated liabilities, including denominations of the
U.K. pound and Swiss franc, whereby a 20% decrease in the
related exchange rates would result in less than
$01million of additional foreign currency risk.   As of

currency denominated liabilities, including denominations of the
Euro, Singapore dollar and Swiss franc, whereby a 20% decrease
in the related exchange rates would result in an aggregate
$03million of additional foreign currency risk.   Interest
Rate Risks   We have interest rate risk with respect to our long-term debt.
As of December31, 2006, we had a total of
$2,0053million of debt of which 809% was fixed rate debt
and 191% was variable rate debt. Our variable rate debt
principally relates to our second lien term loan, foreign
borrowings and any amount outstanding under our
$1000million revolving line of credit, of which no
amounts were drawn as of December31, 2006 but which had
been reduced by $02million related to outstanding letters
of credit at that date. The fixed rate debt consisted of senior
notes, senior subordinated notes and subordinated notes. As of
December31, 2005, we had a total of $2,1406million
of debt of which 819% was fixed rate debt and 181% was
variable rate debt. Changes in interest rates have different
impacts on our fixed and variable rate portions of our debt
portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of
the debt portfolio impacts the fair value of the instrument but
has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in
interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio
impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact
the fair value of the instrument. The fair value of the
convertible notes is also impacted by changes in the market
price of our common stock.   The table below presents the interest rates, maturities and fair

Price Risks   We have convertible notes that are convertible into our common
stock. We currently intend to repay our remaining convertible
notes upon maturity, unless converted or refinanced. If
investors were to decide to convert their notes to common stock,
our future earnings would benefit from a reduction in interest
expense and our common stock outstanding would be increased. If
we paid a premium to induce such conversion, our earnings could
include an additional charge.   Further, the trading price of our common stock has been and is
likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to
wide fluctuations. Such fluctuations could impact our decision
or ability to utilize the equity markets as a potential source
of our funding needs in the future.

60 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Amkor Technology,
Inc.   We have completed integrated audits of Amkor Technology,
Inc.s consolidated financial statements and of its
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2006, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our
opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.   Consolidated
financial statements and financial statement
schedule   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Amkor Technology, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December31, 2006 and 2005, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2006 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.   As discussed in Note1 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
for share-based compensation and defined benefit pension and
other postretirement plans in 2006.   Internal
control over financial reporting   Also, we have audited managements assessment, included in
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item9A, that Amkor Technology,
Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2006, because of the effect of
not maintaining 1effective governance and oversight,
controls to prevent or detect instances of management override,
and risk assessment procedures, and 2effective controls
over the accounting for and disclosure of its stock-based
compensation expense, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
to express opinions on managements assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.   We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide
reasonable   
61 Table of Contents   assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
following material weaknesses have been identified and included
in managements assessment as of December31, 2006   1.The Company did not maintain effective governance and
oversight, controls to prevent or detect instances of management
override, and risk assessment procedures. Specifically, the
Company failed to establish effective governance and oversight
by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of its
activities related to the granting of stock options.
Additionally, controls were not effective in adequately
identifying, assessing and addressing significant risks
associated with the granting of stock options that could impact
the Companys financial reporting. Finally, the
Companys controls were not adequate to prevent or detect
instances of potential misconduct by members of senior
management. This control deficiency resulted in the October 2006
restatement of the Companys consolidated financial
information for each of the years ended from 1998 through 2005,
for each of the quarters of 2005 and 2004, as well as for the
first quarter of 2006. Additionally, this control deficiency
could result in misstatements of the Companys financial
statement accounts and disclosures that would result in a
material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated
financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.
Accordingly, the Companys management has determined that
this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness. This
material weakness also contributed to the existence of the
following additional material weakness.   2.The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
accounting for and disclosure of stock-based compensation
expense. Specifically, effective controls, including monitoring,
were not maintained to ensure the existence, completeness,
accuracy, valuation and presentation of activity related to the
granting and modification of stock options. This control
deficiency resulted in the misstatement of the Companys
stock-based compensation expense and additional paid-in capital
accounts and related disclosures, and the October 2006
restatement of the Companys consolidated financial
information for each of the years ended from 1998 through 2005,
for each of the quarters of 2005 and 2004, as well as for the
first quarter of 2006. Additionally, this control deficiency
could result in misstatements of the aforementioned accounts and
disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the
annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would
not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, the Companys
management has determined that this control deficiency
constitutes a material weakness.   These material weaknesses were considered in determining the
nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit
of the 2006 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion
regarding the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on
those consolidated financial statements.   In our opinion, managements assessment that Amkor
Technology, Inc. did not maintain effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established
in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the COSO. Also, in our opinion, because of the effects
of the material weaknesses described above on the achievement of
the objectives of the control criteria, Amkor Technology, Inc.
has not maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2006, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the COSO.   /s/PricewaterhouseCoopers

Description
of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies   Description
of Business   Amkor is one of the worlds largest subcontractors of
semiconductor packaging sometimes referred to as assembly and
test services. Amkor pioneered the outsourcing of semiconductor
packaging and test services through a predecessor in 1968, and
over the years has built a leading position by   
Providing a broad portfolio of packaging and test technologies
and services   
Designing and developing of new package and test technologies   
Cultivating long-standing relationships with customers,
including many of the worlds leading semiconductor
companies   
Developing expertise in high-volume manufacturing processes to
provide our services;and   
Providing a broadly diversified operational scope, with
production capabilities in China, Korea, Japan, the Philippines,
Singapore, Taiwan and the U.S.   Packaging and test are integral parts of the process of
manufacturing semiconductor chips. This process begins with
silicon wafers and involves the fabrication of electronic
circuitry into complex patterns, thus creating large numbers of
individual chips on the wafers. The fabricated wafers are then
probed to ensure the individual devices meet design
specifications. The packaging process creates an electrical
interconnect between the semiconductor chip and the system
board. In packaging, individual chips are separated from the
fabricated semiconductor wafers, and typically attached through
wire bond or wafer bump technologies to a substrate and then
encased in a protective material to provide optimal electrical
connectivity and thermal performance. The packaged chips are
then tested using sophisticated equipment to ensure that each
packaged chip meets its design specifications. Increasingly,
packages are custom designed for specific chips and specific
end-market applications. We are able to provide turnkey
solutions including semiconductor wafer bump, wafer probe, wafer
backgrind, package design, packaging, test and drop shipment
services. The semiconductors that we package and test for our
customers ultimately become components in electronic systems
used in communications, computing, consumer, industrial and
automotive applications.   Basis
of Presentation   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Amkor Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries Amkor.
The consolidated financial statements reflect the elimination of
all significant inter-company accounts and transactions.
Pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB Interpretation No. FIN 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, our
investments in variable interest entities in which we are the
primary beneficiary are consolidated. Our investments in
variable interest entities in which we are not the primary
beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method.
Investments in and the operating results of 20% to 50% owned
companies which are not variable interest entities are included
in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method
of accounting.   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Certain previously
reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current presentation.   Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities   In January 2003, the FASB issued FINNo46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. The
primary objective of FIN46 is to provide guidance on the
identification of, and financial reporting for, entities over
which control is achieved through means other than voting
rights; such entities are known as variable interest entities.   
67 Table of Contents   AMKOR
TECHNOLOGY, INC.
Notes to
Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   FINNo46 requires variable interest entities to be
consolidated by the primary beneficiary and expands disclosure
requirements for both variable interest entities that are
consolidated as well as those within which an enterprise holds a
significant variable interest. On July1, 2003, we elected
early adoption of FIN46 and have elected not to restate
prior periods.   We have variable interests in certain Philippine realty
corporations in which we have a 40% ownership and from whom we
lease land and buildings in the Philippines. Beginning
July1, 2003, we have consolidated these Philippine realty
corporations within our financial statements. As of
December31, 2006, the combined book value of the assets
and the liabilities associated with these Philippine realty
corporations included in our consolidated balance sheet was
$197million and $16million which excludes an
inter-company payable of $184million which eliminates
during consolidation, respectively. The creditors of the
Philippine realty corporations have no recourse to the general
credit of Amkor Technology, Inc., the primary beneficiary of
these variable interest entities.   Foreign
Currency Translation   The U.S.dollar is the functional currency of our
subsidiaries in China, Korea, the Philippines and Singapore, and
the foreign currency asset and liability amounts at these
subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S.dollars at
end-of-period
exchange rates, except for nonmonetary items which are
remeasured at historical rates. Foreign currency income and
expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect
during the period, except for expenses related to balance sheet
amounts remeasured at historical exchange rates. Exchange gains
and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign
currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are
included in other income expense in the period in which they
occur.   The local currency is the functional currency of our
subsidiaries in Japan and Taiwan, and the asset and liability
amounts of these subsidiaries are translated into
U.S.dollars at
end-of-period
exchange rates. Income and expenses are translated into
U.S.dollars at average exchange rates in effect during the
period. The resulting asset and liability translation
adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income loss in the stockholders equity
section of the balance sheet. Assets and liabilities denominated
in a currency other than the local currency are remeasured into
the local currency prior to translation into U.S.dollars,
and the resulting exchange gains or losses are included in other
income expense in the period in which they occur.   Concentrations
and Credit Risk   Financial instruments, for which we are subject to credit risk,
consist principally of accounts receivable and cash and cash
equivalents. With respect to accounts receivable, we mitigate
our credit risk by selling primarily to well established
companies, performing ongoing credit evaluations and making
frequent contact with customers. We have historically mitigated
our credit risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents
through diversification of our holdings into various high-grade
money market accounts.   Risks
and Uncertainties   Our future results of operations involve a number of risks and
uncertainties. Factors that could affect future results and
cause actual results to vary materially from historical results
include, but are not limited to, historical stock option
practices, pending SEC investigation, fluctuations in operating
results, dependence on the highly cyclical nature of the
semiconductor industry, high fixed costs, declines in average
selling prices, decisions by our integrated device manufacturer
customers to curtail outsourcing, our high leverage and the
restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing our
indebtedness, ability to fund liquidity needs, the absence of
significant backlog in our business, our dependence on
international operations and sales, difficulties integrating
acquisitions, our management information systems may prove
inadequate, difficulties expanding and evolving our operational
capabilities, our dependence on materials and equipment
suppliers, loss of customers, our need for significant capital
expenditures, impairment charges, the increased litigation
incident to our business, adverse tax consequences, rapid
technological change, complexity of packaging and test process,
competition, our need to comply

Notes to
Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   with existing and future environmental regulations, the
enforcement of intellectual property rights by or against us,
fire, flood or other calamity, contagious diseases and continued
control by existing stockholders.   We are subject to certain legal proceedings, lawsuits and other
claims, as discussed in Note16. We assess the likelihood
of any adverse judgment or outcome related to these matters, as
well as potential ranges of probable losses. Our determination
of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these
contingencies is based on an analysis of each individual issue,
often with the assistance of outside legal counsel. We record
provisions in our consolidated financial statements for pending
litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is
probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.   Cash
and Cash Equivalents   We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of
three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.   Restricted
Cash   Restricted cash, current, consists of short-term cash
equivalents used to collateralize our daily banking services.
Restricted cash, noncurrent, collateralizes foreign tax
obligations.   Inventories   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined for approximately 90% of our inventories by using a
moving average method. The remaining inventories use standard
cost, which approximates actual cost. We order raw materials
based on the customers forecasted demand. If our customers
change their forecasted requirements and we are unable to cancel
our raw materials order or if our vendor requires that we order
a minimum quantity that exceeds the current forecasted demand,
we will experience a
build-up in
raw material inventory. We will seek to recover the cost of the
materials from our customers or utilize the inventory in
production. Our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory is
based on the forecasted demand we receive from our customers and
the age of our inventory. When a determination is made that the
inventory will not be utilized in production it is written-off
and disposed.   Property,
Plant and Equipment   Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
is calculated by the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of depreciable assets which are as follows   	
Buildings and improvements
10 to 30years
Machinery and equipment
3 to 7years
Furniture, fixtures and other
equipment
3 to 10years
Land use rights in China
50years
Cost and accumulated depreciation for property retired or
disposed of are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain
or loss is included in earnings. Expenditures for maintenance
and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation
expense was $2633million, $2391million and
$2230million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.   We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may
not be recoverable. Recoverability of a long-lived asset is
measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of
the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and
eventual disposition of the asset. If such asset is considered
to be impaired, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by
which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
Long-lived assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of
cost or fair value less the costs of disposal.   
69 Table of Contents   AMKOR
TECHNOLOGY, INC.
Notes to
Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   Goodwill
and Acquired Intangibles   Goodwill is recorded when the cost of an acquisition exceeds the
fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible
assets acquired. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
are tested for impairment at least annually. Goodwill is tested
for impairment at the reporting unit level. These tests are
performed more frequently if warranted. Impairment losses are
recorded when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its
implied fair value.   Finite-lived intangible assets include customer relationship and
supply agreements as well as patents and technology rights and
are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful lives, generally for periods ranging from 5 to
10years. We continually evaluate the reasonableness of the
useful lives of these assets. Finite-lived intangibles are
tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount many not be
recoverable. An impairment loss, if any, would be measured as
the excess of the carrying value over the fair value determined
by discounted cash flows. Amortization of finite-lived assets
was $96million, $95million, and $67million
for 2006, 2005, 2004, respectively.   Other
Noncurrent Assets   Other noncurrent assets consist principally of deferred income
tax assets, deferred debt issuance costs and refundable security
deposits. At December31, 2005, other noncurrent assets
includes $193million related to the advance on the
acquisition of the remaining minority interest in Unitive
Semiconductor Taiwan UST, which we acquired in
2006.   Other
Noncurrent Liabilities   Other noncurrent liabilities consist primarily of customer
advance payments see Note14 Other Noncurrent
Liabilities.   Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income Loss   The components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss
consisted of the following   	
December31   2006   2005   In thousands   Cumulative unrealized foreign
currency translation gains
4,813     3,658   Pension liability adjustments
11,835        Unrealized gains on securities
960     Total
6,062        3,658   The pension liability amounts above are net of deferred taxes of
$08million. The unrealized gains on securities have no
tax effect. No income taxes are provided on foreign currency
translation gains as foreign earnings are considered permanently
invested.   Revenue
Recognition and Risk of Loss   We recognize revenue from our packaging and test services when
there is evidence of a fixed arrangement, delivery has occurred
or services have been rendered, fees are fixed or determinable,
and collectibility is reasonably assured. Generally these
criteria are met and revenue is recognized upon shipment. Such
policies are consistent with the provisions in Securities and
Exchange Commission SEC Staff Accounting
BulletinNo104, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements.   
70 Table of Contents   AMKOR
TECHNOLOGY, INC.
Notes to
Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   We do not take ownership of customer-supplied semiconductor
wafers. Title and risk of loss remains with the customer for
these materials at all times. Accordingly, the cost of the
customer-supplied materials is not included in the consolidated
financial statements.   A sales allowance is recognized in the period of sale based upon
historical experience. Additionally, provisions are made for
doubtful accounts when there is doubt as to the collectibility
of accounts receivable. Collectibility is assessed based on the
age of the balance, the customers historical payment
history and its current credit worthiness.   Shipping
and Handling Fees and Costs   Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are
presented in net sales. Costs incurred for shipping and handling
are included in costs of sales.   Research
and Development Costs   Research and development expenses include costs attributable to
the conduct of research and development programs primarily
related to the development of new package designs and improving
the efficiency and capabilities of our existing production
processes. Such costs include salaries, payroll taxes, employee
benefit costs, materials, supplies, depreciation on and
maintenance of research equipment, fees under licensing
agreements, services provided by outside contractors, and the
allocable portions of facility costs such as rent, utilities,
insurance, repairs and maintenance, depreciation and general
support services. All costs associated with research and
development are expensed as incurred.   Provision
for Income Taxes   Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability
method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to temporary differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax basis. Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for those
deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that
the related benefits will not be realized.   In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we
consider estimated future taxable income, as well as feasible
tax planning strategies, in each taxing jurisdiction. If all or
a portion of the remaining deferred tax assets will not be
realized, the valuation allowance will be increased with a
charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we will ultimately
be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets
for which a valuation allowance has been provided, the related
portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as
a credit to income tax expense. We monitor on an ongoing basis
our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and the
continuing need for a related valuation allowance. At
December31, 2006, we continued to record a valuation
allowance for substantially all of our deferred tax assets.   New

Notes to

StatementsContinued   pension plan other than a multi-employer plan as an asset or
liability in the statement of financial position and the
recognition of changes in the funded status through
comprehensive income in the year in which such changes occur. We
adopted the recognition provisions of SFASNo158 and
initially applied those to the funded status of our defined
benefit pension plans as of December31, 2006. The initial
recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit pension
plans resulted in a decrease in stockholders equity of
$118million, which was net of a tax benefit of
$08million.   SFASNo158 also requires that the funded status of a
plan be measured as of the date of the year-end statement of
financial position. We currently measure our funded status as of
the balance sheet date. Accordingly, the adoption of the
measurement provisions of SFASNo158 will have no
impact on our financial statements see Note13 for further
discussion.   Effective January1, 2006, we adopted
SFASNo123 revised 2004, Share-Based
Payments SFASNo123R, which
revises SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFASNo123 and
supersedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees APB No25. We elected the
modified prospective method of adoption meaning that years prior
to 2006 reflect stock-based compensation expense determined
pursuant to the provisions of APB No25 see Note 3 for
further discussion.   In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
BulletinNo108, Considering the Effects of Prior
Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current
Year Financial Statements
SABNo108. SABNo108
provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior
year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for
the purpose of a materiality assessment. SABNo108
establishes an approach that requires quantification of
financial statement errors based on the effects of each of the
companys balance sheet and statement of operations and the
related financial statement disclosures. Under certain
circumstances, SABNo108 permits existing public
companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying
this approach in the first year ending after November15,
2006 by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the
carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of
that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening
balance of retained earnings. Additionally, the use of the
cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure
of the nature and amount of each individual error being
corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it
arose. SABNo108 did not have an impact on our
consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations.   In November 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo151,
Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No43,
Chapter4 SFASNo151.
SFASNo151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials
spoilage should be recognized as current-period charges and
requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to
inventory based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. The guidance in this Statement is effective for
inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after
June15, 2005. We adopted the provisions of
SFASNo151 on January1, 2006. The adoption of
this Statement did not have a material impact on our financial
statements.   In December 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo153,
Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an Amendment of APB Opinion
No29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions
SFASNo153. SFASNo153
eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for
nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in
paragraph21b of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No29 and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that
do not have commercial substance. SFASNo153
specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance
if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change
significantly as a result of the exchange.
SFASNo153 is effective in fiscal years beginning
after June15, 2005. We adopted the provisions of
SFASNo153 on January1, 2006. The adoption of
this statement did not have a material impact on our financial
statements.   In May 2005, the FASB issued SFASNo154,
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.
SFASNo154 replaces APB No20,
Accounting Changes and SFASNo3, Reporting
Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements
SFASNo154 and establishes
retrospective application as the required method for reporting a
change in accounting principle. SFASNo154 provides
guidance for determining whether retrospective application   
72 Table of Contents   AMKOR

report such a change. The reporting of a correction of an error
by restating previously issued financial statements is also
addressed. SFASNo154 is effective for accounting
changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning
after December15, 2005. We adopted the provisions of
SFASNo154 on January1, 2006.   In November 2005, FASB issued FASB Staff Position
FSP
FAS115-1/FAS124-1,
The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments
FSP 115-1/124-1. FSP 115-1/124-1 provides guidance
on determining when investments in certain debt and equity
securities are considered impaired, whether that impairment is
other-than-temporary,
and on measuring such impairment loss. FSP 115-1/124-1 also
includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition
of an
other-than-temporary
impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized
losses that have not been recognized as
other-than-temporary
impairments. This FSP is required to be applied to reporting
periods beginning after December15, 2005. We adopted the
provisions FSP 115-1/124-1 on January1, 2006. The adoption
of this FSP did not have a material impact on our financial
statements and disclosures.   Recently
Issued Standards   In February 2006, FASB issued SFASNo155,
Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments
SFASNo155, which amends
SFASNo133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities SFASNo133
and SFASNo140, Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities SFASNo140.
SFASNo155 simplifies the accounting for certain
derivatives embedded in other financial instruments by allowing
them to be accounted for as a whole if the holder elects to
account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis.
SFASNo155 also clarifies and amends certain other
provisions of SFASNo133 and SFASNo140.
SFASNo155 is effective for all financial
instruments acquired, issued or subject to a remeasurement event
occurring in fiscal years beginning after September15,
2006. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided the company has
not yet issued financial statements, including for interim
periods, for that fiscal year. We do not expect the adoption of
SFASNo155 will have a material impact on our
financial statements and disclosures.   In June 2006, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force

How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
Statement That Is, Gross Versus Net Presentation
Issue
No06-03.
Under Issue
No06-03,
a company must disclose its accounting policy regarding the
gross or net presentation of certain taxes. If taxes included in
gross revenues are significant, a company must disclose the
amount of such taxes for each period for which an income
statement is presented i.e., both interim and annual periods.
Taxes within the scope of this Issue are those that are imposed
on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction.
Taxes assessed on an entitys activities over a period of
time, such as gross receipts taxes, are not within the scope of
the issue. Issue
No06-03
is effective for the first annual or interim reporting period
beginning after December15, 2006. We do not expect the
adoption of Issue
No06-03
will have a material impact on our financial statements and
disclosures.   In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an
interpretation of FASB Statement No109
FINNo48, which clarifies the
accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in income tax
positions, as defined. FIN48 seeks to reduce the diversity
in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition
and measurement related to accounting for income taxes.
FIN48 requires that we recognize in our consolidated
financial statements, the impact of a tax position, if that
position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit,
based on the technical merits of the position. The provisions of
FIN48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
periods, and disclosures. This interpretation is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006, with the
cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded
as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
While our analysis of the impact of this interpretation is
ongoing, we do not expect the adoption of FINNo48
to have a material impact on the opening balance of retained
earnings upon adoption on January1, 2007.

Notes to
Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   The FASB has issued SFASNo157, Fair Value
Measurements SFASNo157, which
provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and
liabilities. The standard also responds to investors
requests for more information about 1the extent to which
companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value,
2the information used to measure fair value, and
3the effect that fair value measurements have on
earnings. SFASNo157 will apply whenever another
standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be
measured at fair value. The standard does not expand the use of
fair value to any new circumstances. SFASNo157 is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after November15, 2007, and interim periods
within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the
impact of this standard on our financial statements and
disclosures.

Restatement
of Stock-based Compensation Expense from 1998 through
March2006, Special Committee and Company Findings Relating
to Stock Options   In October 2006, we restated our historical consolidated
financial statements included in our 2005 Annual Report on
Form10-K
and restated certain other historical financial information
relating to accounting for stock options. As a result of a
report by a third party financial analyst issued on May25,
2006, we commenced an initial review of our historical stock
option granting practices. This review included a review of hard
copy documents as well as a limited set of electronic documents.
Following this initial review, on July24, 2006 our Board
of Directors established a Special Committee comprised of
independent directors to conduct a review of our historical
stock option granting practices since our initial public
offering in 1998 through June30, 2006.   Based on the findings of the Special Committee and our internal
review, we identified a number of occasions on which we used an
incorrect measurement date for financial accounting and
reporting purposes. In accordance with APBNo25, and
related interpretations, with respect to the period through
December31, 2005, we should have recorded compensation
expense in an amount per share subject to each option to the
extent that the fair market value of our stock on the correct
measurement date exceeded the exercise price of the option. For
periods commencing January1, 2006, compensation expense is
recorded in accordance with SFAS No123R. We also
identified a number of other option grants for which we failed
to properly apply the provisions of APB No25 or
SFASNo123 and related interpretations of each
pronouncement. In considering the causes of the accounting
errors set forth below, the Special Committee concluded that the
evidence did not support a finding of intentional manipulation
of stock option grant pricing by any member of existing
management. However, based on its review, the Special Committee
identified evidence that supported a finding of intentional
manipulation of stock option pricing with respect to annual
grants in 2001 and 2002 by a former executive and that other
former executives may have been aware of, or participated in
this conduct. In addition the Special Committee identified a
number of other factors related to our internal controls that
contributed to the accounting errors that led to the October
2006 restatement of our prior filings. Our financial statements
as of December31, 2005 and 2004 and for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2005 were previously
restated to reflect the corrections of these errors and were
included in our Annual Report on
Form10-K/A
for the year ended December31, 2005 as filed on
October6, 2006. The following table reconciles share-based
compensation previously recorded, the impact of these errors, by

Grants.We determined that, in connection with
our annual stock option grants to employees in 1999, 2000, 2001,
2002 and 2004, the number of shares that an individual employee
was entitled to receive was not determined until after the
original grant date, and therefore the measurement date for such
options was subsequent to the original grant date. As a result,
we restated our financial information to increase stock-based
compensation expense by a total of $956million recognized
over the applicable vesting periods. For certain of these
options forfeited in 2002 in connection with an option exchange
program 2002 Option Exchange Program, the
remaining compensation expense was accelerated into 2002. For
certain other options, compensation expense was accelerated into
2004, in connection with the acceleration of all unvested
options as of July1, 2004 2004 Accelerated
Vesting. We undertook the 2004 Accelerated Vesting
program for the purpose of enhancing employee morale, helping
retain high potential employees in the face of a downturn in
industry conditions and to avoid future compensation charges
subsequent to the adoption of SFASNo123R.   Modifications to Stock Option Grants.We
determined that from 1998 through 2005, we had not properly
accounted for stock options modified for certain individuals who
held consulting, transition or advisory roles with us. These
included instances of continued vesting after an individual was
no longer required to provide substantive services to Amkor
after an individual converted from an employee to a consultant
or advisory role, and extensions of option vesting and exercise
periods. Some of these modifications were not identified in our
financial reporting processes and were therefore not properly
reflected in our financial statements. As a result, we restated
our financial information to increase stock-based compensation
expense by a total of $95million recognized as of the
date of the respective modifications.   75 Table of Contents   AMKOR
TECHNOLOGY, INC.
Notes to
Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   Improper Measurement Dates for Other Stock Option
Grants.We determined that from 1998 through
2005, we had not properly accounted for certain employee stock
options granted prior to obtaining authorization of the grants.
These options included those granted as of November9, 1998
in connection with the settlement of a deferred compensation
liability to employees that had not been approved by our Board
of Directors until November10, 1998 as well as stock
options granted to new hires and existing employees in
recognition of achievements, promotions, retentions and other
events. As a result of these errors, we restated our financial
information to increase stock-based compensation expense by a
total of $21million recognized over the applicable
vesting periods. For certain of these option grants, the
recognition of this expense was also accelerated under the 2002
Option Exchange Program or the 2004 Accelerated Vesting, as
described under Improper Measurement Dates for Annual
Stock Option Grants.   Stock Option Grants to Non-employees.We
determined that from 1998 to 2004, we had not properly accounted
for stock option grants issued to employees of an equity
affiliate, consultants, or other persons who did not meet the
definition of an employee. We erroneously accounted for such
grants in accordance with APB No25 rather than
SFASNo123 and related interpretations. As a result,
we restated our financial information to increase stock-based
compensation expense by a total of $16million.   All of the foregoing charges were non-cash and had no impact on
our reported net sales or cash or cash equivalents. The
aggregate amount of the additional stock-based compensation
expense that we identified as a result of the stock option
review is approximately $1088million through
June30, 2006.   Incremental stock-based compensation charges of
$1088million resulted in deferred income tax benefits of
$32million. Such amount is nominal relative to the amount
of the incremental stock-based compensation charges as we
maintained a full valuation allowance against our domestic
deferred tax assets since 2002 coupled with the fact that
incremental stock-based compensation charges relating to our
foreign subsidiaries were not deductible for local tax purposes
during the relevant periods due to the absence of related
re-charge agreements with those subsidiaries. The
$32million deferred tax benefit resulted primarily from
the write-off of stock-based compensation related deferred tax
assets to additional paid-in capital in 2002; such write-off had
originally been charged to income tax expense in 2002. We also
recorded payroll related taxes totaling $04million
primarily relating to certain of our French employees.   As a result of our determination that the exercise prices of
certain option grants were below the market price of our stock
on the actual grant date, we evaluated whether the affected
employees would have any adverse tax consequences under
Section409A of the Internal Revenue Code the
IRC. Because Section409A relates to the
employees income recognition as stock options vest, when
we accelerated the vesting of all unvested options in July 2004
the 2004 Accelerated Vesting described under
Improper Measurement Dates for Annual Grants the
impact of Section409A was mitigated for substantially all
of our outstanding stock grants. For stock options granted
subsequent to the 2004 Accelerated Vesting, the impact of
Section409A is not expected to materially impact our
employees and financial statements as a result of various
transition rules and potential remediation efforts. Further we
considered IRC Section162 mand its established
limitation thresholds relating to total remuneration and
concluded, for periods prior to June30, 2006, that our tax
deductions related to stock-based compensation were not
materially changed as a result of any employee whose
remuneration changed as a result of receiving an option at less
than fair value.   As described in Note16, the SEC has requested that we
provide documentation related to our historical stock option
practices expanding the scope of its ongoing investigation of us
concerning unrelated matters. We intend to continue to cooperate
with the SEC.

Stock
Compensation Plans   Effective January1, 2006, we adopted
SFASNo123R which revises SFASNo123
and supersedes APB No25.SFASNo123R
requires that all share-based payments to employees, including
grants of employee stock options, be measured at fair value and
expensed over the service period generally the vesting period.
Upon

modified prospective method, whereby compensation cost under
SFASNo123R is recognized beginning
January1, 2006 and thereafter, with prior periods
stock-based compensation for option and employee stock purchase
plan activity still determined pursuant to APB No25 with
pro forma disclosure provided as if SFASNo123 had
been applied. We continue to use the Black-Scholes option
valuation model to value stock options. Compensation expense is
measured and recognized beginning in 2006 as follows   Awards granted after December31, 2005
Awards are measured at their fair value at the date of grant
under the provisions of SFASNo123R with the
resulting compensation expense recognized ratably over the
vesting period of the award. However, if the employee becomes
eligible for retirement during the vesting period, the
compensation expense is recognized ratably only until the
retirement eligibility date. For employees eligible for
retirement on the date of grant, compensation expense is
recognized immediately.   Awards granted prior to December31,
2005 Awards were measured at their fair value at
the date of original grant under the original provisions of
SFAS123. Compensation expense associated with the unvested
portion of these options at January1, 2006 is recognized
ratably over the remaining vesting period without regard to the
employees retirement eligibility. Upon retirement, any
unrecognized compensation expense will be recognized immediately.   For all grants, the amount of compensation expense to be
recognized is adjusted for an estimated forfeiture rate which is
based on historical data. For the year ended December31,
2006, we recognized compensation expense of $48million,
with no tax impact, which was substantially a result of the
adoption of SFASNo123R. The adoption of
SFAS123R reduced our basic and diluted earnings per
share by $003 for the year ended December31, 2006.   The following table presents stock-based compensation expense

more detail below.   In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP
No123R-3,
Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects
of Share-Based Payment Awards. We have elected to adopt the
alternative transition method provided in the FSP for
calculating tax effects of equity-based compensation pursuant to
SFASNo123R. The alternative transition method
includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance
of the additional paid-in capital pool APIC pool
related to the tax effects of employee equity-based
compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC
pool and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows of the tax effects
of employee equity-based compensation awards that are
outstanding upon the implementation of SFASNo123R.   Prior to January1, 2006, as permitted under
SFASNo123, we applied APB Opinion No25 and
related interpretations in accounting for our stock-based
compensation plans. Under APB Opinion No25, compensation
expense was recognized for stock option grants if the exercise
price was below the fair value of the underlying stock at the
measurement date.

Option Plans   Stock options are generally granted with an exercise price equal
to the market price of the stock at the date of grant.
Substantially all of the options granted are generally
exercisable pursuant to a two to four-year vesting schedule and
the term of the options granted is no longer than ten years.   1998Director Option Plan.The option
grants under the Director Plan are automatic and
non-discretionary. As of January1, 2003, the Director Plan
provides for an initial grant of options to purchase
20,000shares of common stock to each new non-employee
director of Amkor when such individual first becomes an outside
director. In addition, each non-employee director will
automatically be granted subsequent options to purchase
10,000shares of common stock on each date on which such
director is re-elected by the stockholders of Amkor, provided
that as of such date such director has served on the Board of
Directors for at least six months. Each option granted to a
non-employee director vests over a three-year period. Future
grants to non-employee directors are permitted to be granted,
and may to be granted under the Director Plan or the 1998 Stock
Plan.   1998 Stock Plan.The 1998 Stock Plan generally
provides for the grant to employees, directors and consultants
of stock options and stock purchase rights. Under the 1998 Stock
Plan, there is a provision for an annual replenishment to bring
the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under
the plan up to 5million as of each January1. Unless
determined otherwise by the Board of Directors or a committee
appointed by the Board of Directors, options and stock purchase
rights granted under the 1998 Plan are not transferable by the
optionee. In general, the options granted will vest over a four
year-period.   2003 Nonstatutory Inducement Grant Stock

2003 Nonstatutory Inducement Grant Stock Plan the 2003

During August 2004 the Compensation Committee of our Board of
Directors approved the full vesting of all unvested outstanding
employee stock options that were issued prior to July1,
2004   In the fourth quarter of 2006, we extended an offer to amend the
exercise price of certain options that were granted at a
discount from fair market value as the holder may be subject to
adverse tax consequences under Section409A of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code. For each of the 735,000 options held by
the 260 individuals accepting our offer to amend their options,
a cash payment was made in January 2007 for the difference
between the new exercise price per share of the amended option
and the original exercise price per share. We recognized
$05million in compensation expense in 2006 related to
this offer.   In order to calculate the fair value of stock options at the
date of grant, we used the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Expected volatilities are based on historical performance of our
stock. We also use historical data to estimate the timing and
amount of option exercises and forfeitures within the valuation
model. The expected term of the options is based on evaluations
of historical and expected future employee exercise behavior and
represents the period of time that options granted are expected
to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate for periods
within the contractual life of the option is based on the
U.S.Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
The following assumptions were used to calculate weighted
average fair values of the options granted

7,555     6,776   In 2006, the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets
decreased by $239million, primarily as a result of a
$145million benefit relating to utilization of
U.S.net operating loss carryforwards and a
$64million benefit relating to utilization of Taiwanese
net operating loss carryforwards. In 2006, the current earnings
and profits of our wholly-owned subsidiary in the Philippines
was considered a deemed dividend for U.S. tax purposes resulting
in use of U.S. net operating loss carryforwards which had no
incremental effect on our consolidated provision. During 2005,
the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets increased by
$750million, resulting from a charge to establish a
valuation allowance against the increase in our U.S., Taiwanese,
Singaporean, and Philippine net operating loss carryforwards,
capital loss carryforwards, tax credits and other deferred tax
assets. In 2004, the valuation allowance on our deferred tax
assets decreased by $245million, primarily as a result of
a $342million benefit relating to utilization of
U.S.net operating loss carryforwards, offset by a
$97million valuation allowance against USTs net
operating losses which was recorded in connection with our UST
acquisition accounting. In connection with our divestiture in
2004 of 101million shares of ASI common stock, we
generated a capital loss of approximately $568million;
however, we provided a full valuation allowance against such
capital loss because we did not have any offsetting capital
gains. At December31, 2006, the valuation allowance
includes amounts relating to the tax benefits of pre-acquisition
net operating losses and credits. If these benefits are
subsequently realized, they will be recorded to goodwill and
non-current intangible assets in the amounts of
$147million and $37million, respectively.   At December31, 2006, the valuation allowance includes
amounts relating to tax benefits of the tax deduction associated
with employee stock options. If these benefits are subsequently
realized, they will be recorded to contributed capital in the
amount of $30million. As a result of net operating loss
carryforwards, we were not able to recognize the windfall tax
benefits of stock option deductions in 2006 because the
deductions did not reduce income tax payable using a
with-and-without
approach for the utilization of tax attributes.   As a result of certain capital investments, export commitments
and employment levels, income from operations in Korea, the
Philippines, China and Singapore is subject to reduced tax
rates, and in some cases is exempt from taxes. In Korea, we
benefit from a tax holiday extending through 2014 that provides
for a 100% tax   
82 Table of Contents   AMKOR

StatementsContinued   holiday for seven years and then a 50% tax holiday for an
additional three years. In the Philippines, our operating
locations operate in economic zones and in exchange for tax
holidays, we have committed to certain export and employment
levels. For 2005, certain qualifying Philippine operations
benefited from a full tax holiday, expiring at the end of 2005,
while the remaining operations benefited from a perpetual
reduced tax rate of 5%. The full tax holiday on certain
qualifying Philippine operations was extended through 2006. As a
result of our 2001 investment in China, we expect to benefit
from a 100% tax holiday for five years and then a 50% tax
holiday for an additional five years. This tax holiday commences
in the first full taxable period when our Chinese operations
have taxable income, after utilization of any allowable Chinese
net operating loss carryforwards. The tax holiday in China has
not yet commenced. In October 2006, we were granted a ten year
pioneer incentive award by the Singapore Economic Development
Board. Singapore operations will benefit from a 100% tax holiday
for up to ten years, beginning on January1, 2007. As a
result of the net operating losses incurred by our foreign
subsidiaries subject to tax holidays, we did not recognize any
benefits relating to such tax holidays in 2006, 2005 or 2004
other than in the Philippines. In 2006, our Philippines
operations recognized $21million in tax benefits, or
$001 per diluted share, as a result of the tax holiday on
certain qualifying operations.   At December31, 2006, we have U.S. and state net operating
losses available to be carried forward totaling
$3628million and $2698million, respectively,
expiring in varying amounts through 2025. Additionally, as of
December31, 2006, our Taiwan and Philippines operations
had $472million and $39million respectively, of
net operating losses available for carryforward. If these
foreign net operating losses are not utilized, they will expire
in varying amounts through 2011. Net operating losses generated
in Singapore through 2006 are not available for carryforward to
future periods in connection with the pioneer incentive award
granted in October 2006. We also have U.S.capital loss
carryforwards of $2713million which will expire in
varying amounts from 2007 through 2009. Our ability to utilize
our U.S.net operating and capital loss carryforwards may
be limited in the future if we experience an ownership change as
defined by the Internal Revenue Code.   At December31, 2006, we have various tax credits available
to be carried forward including U.S foreign income tax credits
totaling $57million, expiring in 2011, and Taiwanese
income tax credits totaling $132million, expiring in
varying amounts through 2010.   Income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed
earnings of our foreign subsidiaries approximately
$1381million at December31, 2006over which
we have sufficient influence to control the distribution of such
earnings and have determined that such earnings have been
reinvested indefinitely. These earnings could become subject to
either or both federal income tax and foreign withholding tax if
they are remitted as dividends, if foreign earnings are loaned
to any of our domestic subsidiaries, or if we sell our
investment in such subsidiaries. We estimate that repatriation
of these foreign earnings would generate additional foreign
withholding taxes of approximately $227million. There
would be no U.S.federal income tax since our U.S.net
operating losses exceed the amount of undistributed foreign
earnings.   At December31, 2006 and 2005, current deferred tax assets
of $42million and $53million, respectively, are
included in other current assets and noncurrent deferred tax
assets of $34million and $37million, respectively,
are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.
In addition, at December31, 2006 and 2005, current
deferred tax liabilities of $00million and
$01million, respectively, are included in other current
liabilities and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of
$01million and $22million, respectively, are
included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheet.   We operate in and file income tax returns in various U.S. and
foreign jurisdictions which are subject to examination by tax
authorities. For our larger foreign operations, our tax returns
have been examined through 1999 in Korea, through 2001 in the
Philippines and through 2002 in Taiwan and Japan. Our tax
returns for open years in all jurisdictions are subject to
changes upon examination.   During 2003, the Internal Revenue Service IRS
commenced an examination of our U.S.federal income tax
returns relating to years 2000 and 2001. In September 2005, the
Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation   
83 Table of Contents   AMKOR

Notes to
Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   approved the settlement of our IRS examination of the years 2000
and 2001. As part of the settlement, we agreed to make certain
adjustments to our U.S.federal income tax returns in the
years 2000 through 2003 for local attribution of income
resulting from inter-company transactions, including ownership
and use of intellectual property, in various U.S. and foreign
jurisdictions. The IRS adjustments for the years 2000 and 2001
lowered our U.S.net operating loss carryforwards by
$292million. As a result of the finalization of this IRS
examination, we reduced our deferred tax assets by
$250million and our accrued income taxes by
$284million, resulting in a net tax benefit of
$34million recorded in 2005.   During 2005, the IRS also commenced an examination of our
U.S.federal income tax returns relating to years 2002 and
2003. The IRS exam, a limited scope examination, primarily
reviewing inter-company transfer pricing and cost sharing issues
carried over from the 2000 and 2001 examination, was completed
in 2006. Upon settlement of the exam, we agreed to four
adjustments, lowering our U.S.net operating loss
carryforwards by $493million. There was no impact to our
consolidated statements of operations as we maintain a full
valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets.   Our estimated tax liability is subject to change as examinations
of specific tax years are completed in the respective
jurisdictions. Amounts accrued for potential income tax
assessments, which are included in accrued expenses in the
consolidated balance sheet, total $20million and
$28million at December31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The $08million reduction in our related
accrual was primarily attributable to a reduction for state
taxes paid relating to the 2000 and 2001 IRS audit.   We believe that any additional taxes or related interest over
the amounts accrued will not have a material effect on our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, nor do
we expect that examinations to be completed in the near term
would have a material favorable impact. However, resolution of
these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances
that the outcomes will be favorable.

Earnings
Per Share   Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by
dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS adjusts
net income and the outstanding shares for the dilutive effect of
stock options and convertible debt. The basic and diluted EPS
amounts are the same for the years ended December31, 2005
and 2004, as a result of the potentially dilutive securities
being antidilutive due to net losses. The following table

offset by the realization of $03million in previously
unrealized gains which were included in other comprehensive
income at December31, 2004. These charges were recognized
as we believed the related decline in value was other than

Secured Credit Facilities   In November 2005, we entered into a $1000million first
lien revolving credit facility available through November 2009,
with a letter of credit
sub-limit of
$250million. Interest is charged under the credit
facility at a floating rate based on the base rate in effect
from time to time plus the applicable margins which range from
00% to 05% for base rate revolving loans, or LIBOR plus 15%
to 225% for LIBOR revolving loans. The LIBOR-based interest
rate at December31, 2006 was 686%; however, no borrowings
were outstanding on this credit facility. AmkorTechnology,
Inc., along with, Unitive Inc. Unitive and Unitive
Electronics Inc. UEI, were co-borrowers under the
loan and granted a first priority lien on substantially all of
their assets, excluding inter-company loans and the capital
stock of foreign subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries.
In November 2006, Unitive and UEI were merged into Amkor. As of
December31, 2006, we had utilized $02million of the
available letter of credit
sub-limit,
and had $998million available under this facility. The
borrowing base for the revolving credit facility is based on the
valuation of our eligible accounts receivable. We incur
commitment fees on the unused amounts of the revolving credit
facility ranging from 025% to 050%, based on our liquidity.
This facility includes a number of affirmative and negative
covenants, which could restrict our operations. If we were to
default under the first lien revolving credit facility, we would
not be permitted to draw additional amounts, and the banks could
accelerate our obligation to pay all outstanding amounts.   In October 2004, we entered into a $3000million second
lien term loan with a group of institutional lenders. The term
loan bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 450 basis points
987% and 888% at December31, 2006 and December31,
2005, respectively; and matures in October 2010. In 2006, we
liquidated certain of our subsidiaries, and Unitive, UEI, Amkor
International Holdings, LLC AIH and P-Four, Inc.
P-Four ceased to be guarantors under the term
loan. The second lien term loan is secured by a second lien on
substantially all of our U.S.subsidiaries assets,
including a portion of the shares of certain of our foreign
subsidiaries. As of October27, 2006 we have the option to
prepay the loan at any time, subject to an initial prepayment
premium of 3% of the principal amount prepaid. The second lien
term loan agreements contain a number of affirmative and
negative covenants which could restrict our operations. If we
were to default under the facility, the lenders could accelerate
our obligation to pay all outstanding amounts.   Senior
and Senior Subordinated Notes   In February 2001, we issued $5000million of 925% Senior
Notes due February 2008 the 2008 Notes. As of
December31, 2005, we had purchased $295million of
these notes. In January 2006, we purchased an additional
$300million of these notes and recorded a gain on
extinguishment of $07million which is included in debt
retirement costs, net, which was partially offset by the
write-off of a proportionate amount of our deferred debt
issuance costs of $02million. A portion of the 2008 Notes
are not redeemable prior to their maturity. In April 2006, we
announced a tender offer for the 2008 Notes. We used the net
proceeds from the 2016 Notes described below to purchase
$3523million in notes tendered. We recorded a
$202million loss on extinguishment related to premiums
paid for the purchase of the 2008 Notes and a $22million
charge for the associated unamortized deferred debt issuance
costs. Both charges are included in debt retirement costs, net.   In March 2004, we issued $2500million of
7125%Senior Notes due March 2011 the 2011
Notes. The 2011 Notes were priced at 99321%, yielding an
effective interest rate of 725%. The 2011 Notes are redeemable
by us at any time provided we pay the holders a
make-whole premium. Prior to March15, 2007, we
may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the
notes from the proceeds of one or more equity offerings at a
price of 107125% of the principal amount plus accrued and
unpaid interest.   In May 2003, we issued $4250million of 775%Senior

are not redeemable at our option until May 2008.

redeemable by us prior to June1, 2011 provided we pay the
holders a make-whole premium. After June1,
2011, the 2016 Notes are redeemable at specified prices. In
addition, prior to June1, 2009, we may redeem up to 35% of
the notes at a specified price with the proceeds of certain
equity offerings. After deducting fees to the underwriter, the
net proceeds were used to purchase a portion of the 2008 Notes,
and to pay respective accrued interest and tender premiums.   In May 1999, we issued $2000million of 105%Senior
Subordinated Notes due May 2009 the 2009 Notes. In
June 2006, we used the proceeds from the May 2011 Notes
described below in connection with a partial call of the 2009
Notes for which $1781million of the 2009 Notes were
repurchased. We recorded a $31million loss on
extinguishment related to premiums paid for the purchase of the
2009 Notes and a $22million charge for the associated
unamortized deferred debt issuance costs. Both charges are
included in debt retirement costs, net. As of December31,
2006, the 2009 Notes were redeemable at our option at a price of
10125% of the principal of the notes plus accrued and unpaid
interest.   The senior and senior subordinated notes contain a number of
affirmative and negative covenants, which could restrict our
operations. Unitive, UEI, AIH, P-Four and Amkor Technology
Limited ATL previously guaranteed the senior and
senior subordinated notes. In 2006, we liquidated certain of
our subsidiaries and the guarantees of the senior and senior
subordinated notes terminated or were released in accordance
with the terms of the indentures governing the notes.   Senior
Subordinated and Subordinated Convertible Notes   In May 2006, we issued $1900million of our 25%
Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 the May
2011 Notes. The May 2011 Notes are convertible at any
time prior to the maturity date into our common stock at a price
of $1459per share, subject to adjustment. The notes are
subordinated to the prior payment in full of all of our senior
debt. After deducting fees to the underwriter, the net proceeds
from the issuance of the May 2011 Notes were used to repurchase
a portion of the 2009 Notes, pay respective accrued interest and
call premiums.   In May 2001, we issued $2500million of our 575%
Convertible Subordinated Notes due June 2006 the 2006
Notes. In November 2003, we purchased $170million
of the 2006 Notes with the proceeds of an equity offering. In
November 2005, we purchased an additional $1000million of
the 2006 Notes with proceeds from the issuance of
$1000million of 625%Convertible Subordinated Notes
due December 2013 described below. We purchased such 2006 Notes
on the open market at 99125% and recorded a gain on
extinguishment of $09million which was partially offset
by the write-off of a proportionate amount of our deferred debt
issuance costs of $03million. In January 2006, we
purchased an additional $10million of the 2006 Notes at
9925%. In June 2006, we repaid the remaining balance of

of Subsidiaries   Secured
Term Loans   In June 2005, UST entered into a New Taiwan Dollar
NT$ 4000million approximately
$122million term loan due June20, 2008 the
UST Note, which accrues interest at the Taiwan
90-Day
Commercial Paper Secondary Market rate plus 225% 423% and
397% as of December31, 2006 and December31, 2005.
The proceeds of the UST Note were used to satisfy notes
previously held by UST. Amkor has guaranteed the repayment of
this loan. The agreement governing the UST Note includes a
number of affirmative and negative covenants which could
restrict our operations. If we were to default under the
facility, the lenders could accelerate our obligation to pay all
outstanding amounts.   In September 2005, Amkor Technology Taiwan, Inc.
ATT entered into a short-term interim financing
arrangement with two Taiwanese banks for NT$10billion
approximately $300million the Bridge Loan
in connection with a syndication loan led by the same lenders.
In November 2005, ATT finalized the NT$18billion
approximately $535million syndication loan due November
2010 the Syndication Loan, which accrues interest
at the Taiwan
90-Day
Commercial Paper Primary Market rate plus 12%. At
December31, 2006 and December31, 2005, the interest
rate was 322% and 30%, respectively. A portion of the
Syndication Loan was used to pay off the Bridge Loan. Amkor has
guaranteed the repayment of this loan. The agreement governing
the Syndication Loan includes a number of affirmative, negative
and financial covenants, which could restrict our operations. If
we were to default under the facility, the lenders could
accelerate our obligation to pay all outstanding amounts.   Secured
Equipment and Property Financing   Our secured equipment and property financing consists of loans
secured with specific assets at our Japanese, Singaporean and
Chinese subsidiaries. Our credit facility in Japan provides for
equipment financing on a three-year basis for each piece of
equipment purchased. The Japanese facility accrues interest at
359% on all outstanding balances and has maturities at various
times between 2006 and 2008. In December 2005, our Singaporean
subsidiary entered into a loan with a finance company for
$100million, which accrues interest at 486% and is due
December 2008. The loan, guaranteed by Amkor Technology, Inc.,
is secured by a monetary security deposit and certain equipment
in our Singapore facility. In May 2004, our Chinese subsidiary
entered into a $55million credit facility secured with
buildings at one of our Chinese production facilities and is
payable ratably through January2012. The interest rate for
the Chinese financing at December31, 2006 and
December31, 2005, was 614%, and 558%, respectively.
These equipment and property financings contain affirmative and
negative covenants, which could restrict our operations, and, if
we were to default on our obligations under these financings,
the lenders could accelerate our obligation to repay amounts
borrowed under such facilities.   Revolving
Credit Facilities   Amkor Iwate Corporation, a Japanese subsidiary
AIC, has a revolving line of credit with a
Japanese bank for 25billion Japanese yen approximately
$212million, maturing in September 2007, that accrues
interest at the Tokyo Interbank Offering Rate
TIBOR plus 06%. The interest rate at
December31, 2006 ranged from 097% to 104%, and
December31, 2005 was 066%. Amounts drawn on the line of
credit were $76million and $212million at
December31, 2006 and December31, 2005, respectively.

bank for 3000million Japanese yen approximately
$25million, maturing in June 2007, that accrues interest
at TIBOR plus 05%. The interest rate at December31, 2006
and December31, 2005 was 092% and 056%, respectively.
There were no amounts drawn on the line of credit as of
December31, 2006 and December31, 2005, respectively.   In September 2005, our Philippine subsidiary entered into a
one-year revolving line of credit that accrues interest at LIBOR
plus 10% 52% at December31, 2005. In January 2006, we
repaid all amounts outstanding under the Philippine revolving
line of credit, and replaced it with a new revolving line of
credit for $50million, maturing in September 2006, that
accrues interest at LIBOR plus 10%. This line of credit was
absorbed by the line of credit entered into in April 2006. In
April 2006, our Philippine subsidiary renewed and increased its
revolving line of credit from 5000million Philippine peso
approximately $98million to 7950million
Philippine peso approximately $155million, maturing
March 2007, that accrues interest at LIBOR plus 10% 623% at
December31, 2006. There were no amounts outstanding at
December31, 2006.   In January 2006, Amkor Assembly Test Shanghai Co.
Ltd., a Chinese subsidiary AATS, entered into a
$150million working capital facility which bears interest
at LIBOR plus 125%, which matured and was paid off in January
2007. The borrowings outstanding as of December31, 2006
were $150million. At December31, 2006, the interest
rate ranged from 662% to 681% based on the dates of borrowing.   These lines of credit contain certain affirmative and negative
covenants, which could restrict our operations. If we were to
default on our obligations under any of these lines of credit,
we would not be permitted to draw additional amounts, and the
lenders could accelerate our obligation to pay all outstanding
amounts.   Other
Debt   Other debt includes debt related to our Taiwanese subsidiaries
with fixed and variable interest rates maturing in 2007.
Interest rates on this debt ranged from 314% to 45% as of
December31, 2006 and ranged from 267% to 310% as of

an annual basis. The expense for this plan was
$19million, $22million and $19million in
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.   Taiwan
Defined Contribution Plan   On July1, 2005, we implemented a defined contribution plan
under the Taiwanese Labor Pension Act in Taiwan whereby
employees can contribute up to 6% of salary. We contribute no
less than 6% of the employees salaries up to a defined
maximum into their individual accounts. The expense for this
plan in 2006 and 2005 was $16million and
$09million, respectively.   Korean
Severance Plans   Our Korean subsidiary participates in an accrued severance plan
that covers employees and directors with at least one year of
service. Eligible employees are entitled to receive a lump-sum
payment upon termination of employment, based on their length of
service and rate of pay at the time of termination. Accrued
severance benefits are estimated assuming all eligible employees
were to terminate their employment at the balance sheet date.
Our contributions to the National Pension Plan of the Republic
of Korea are deducted from accrued severance benefit
liabilities. During 2006, we announced an early voluntary
retirement program. All charges related to this program were
paid as of December31, 2006. See Note20 for future

and initially applied them to the funded status of our defined
benefit postretirement plans as of December31, 2006. The

Law Fund mandates such contributions into a cash account balance
at the Central Trust of China. The Japanese defined benefit
pension plans are non-funded plans, and as such, no assets exist
related to these plans. Our investment strategy for our
Philippine defined benefit plan is long-term, sustained asset
growth through low to medium risk investments. The current rate
of return assumption targets an asset allocation strategy for
our Philippine plan assets of 20% to 75% emerging market debt,
10% to 40% international equities primarily U.S. and Europe,
and 0% to 10% international fixed-income securities. The
remainder of the portfolio will contain other investments such

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been
determined using available market information and appropriate
methodologies; however, considerable judgment is required in
interpreting market data to develop the estimates for fair
value. Accordingly, these estimates are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current
market exchange. Certain of these financial instruments are with
major financial institutions and expose us to market and credit
risks and may at times be concentrated with certain
counterparties or groups of counterparties. The creditworthiness
of counterparties is continually reviewed, and full performance
is anticipated.   The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for other
accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses
approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these
instruments. The methods and assumptions used to estimate the
fair value of other significant classes of financial instruments
is set forth below   Cash and Cash Equivalents.Cash and cash
equivalents are due on demand or carry a maturity date of less
than three months when purchased. The carrying amount of these
financial instruments is a reasonable estimate of fair value.   Available for sale investments.Available for

these financial instruments is estimated based on market quotes.   Long-term debt.The carrying amount of our
total long-term debt as of December31, 2006 and 2005 was

our exposure to these indemnification obligations. The maximum
amount of future payments is generally unlimited. There is no
amount recorded for these indemnifications at December31,
2006 and 2005. Due to the nature of these indemnifications, it
is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum
potential loss or range of loss. No assets are held as
collateral and no specific recourse provisions exist related to
these indemnifications.   As of December31, 2006, we have outstanding
$02million of standby letters of credit and have
available an additional $248million. Such standby letters
of credit are used in our ordinary course of business and are
collateralized by our cash balances.   We generally warrant that our services will be performed in a
professional and workmanlike manner, and in compliance with our
customers specifications. We accrue costs for known
warranty issues. Historically, our warranty costs have been
immaterial.   Litigation   We are involved in claims and legal proceedings and we may
become involved in other legal matters arising in the ordinary
course of our business. We evaluate these claims and legal
matters on a case-by-case basis to make a determination as to
the impact, if any, on our results of operations or financial
condition. Except as indicated below, we currently believe that
the ultimate outcome of these claims and proceedings,
individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material
adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows. The estimate of the potential impact of these
claims and legal proceedings on our financial position, results
of operations or cash flows could change in the future.   We currently are party to the legal proceedings described below.
Attorney fees related to legal matters are expensed as incurred.

Arbitration the Request with the International
Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce,
captioned Tessera, Inc.v. Amkor Technology, Inc.
The subject matter of the arbitration is a license agreement
entered into between Tessera and our predecessor in 1996. The
license agreement pertains to certain patents and know-how
relating to semiconductor packaging. In their Request, Tessera
alleges that Amkor owes Tessera royalties under the license
agreement in an amount between $85 and $115million for
semiconductor packages assembled by us through 2005. In our
Answer and Counterclaim, we denied that any royalties were owed,
and asserted that we are not using any of the licensed Tessera
patents or know-how. We also asserted defenses and counterclaims
of invalidity and unenforceability of the four patents
identified by Tessera in their Request as the basis for their
claim U.S.Patent Nos. 5,697,977, 5,852,326, 6,433,419 and
6,465,893. On November10, 2006, Tessera provided their
Preliminary Claim Charts and added two additional patents to the
proceeding, U.S.Patent Nos. 6,133,627 and 5,861,666.
Discovery is proceeding, and the arbitration is currently set
for a hearing beginning October 2007. Although we believe that
we have meritorious defenses and counterclaims in this matter
and will seek a judgment in our favor, as of the date of this
Annual Report, it is not possible to predict the outcome or
likely outcome of the arbitration or the total cost of resolving
this controversy including the impact of possible future claims
of additional royalties by Tessera. The final resolution of this
controversy could result in significant liabilities and could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.   Securities
ClassAction Litigation   On January23, 2006, a purported securities class action
suit entitled Nathan Weiss etal.v. Amkor
Technology, Inc. etal., was filed in
U.S.District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania against Amkor and certain of its   
101 Table of Contents   AMKOR

Notes to
Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   current and former officers. Subsequently, other law firms filed
two similar cases, which were consolidated with the initial
complaint. In August 2006 and again in November 2006, the
plaintiffs amended the complaint. The plaintiffs added
additional officer, director and former director defendants and
allege improprieties in certain option grants. The amended
complaint further alleges that defendants improperly recorded
and accounted for the options in violation of generally accepted
accounting principles and made materially false and misleading
statements and omissions in its disclosures in violation of the
federal securities laws, during the period from July 2001 to
July 2006. The amended complaint seeks certification as a class
action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Proc23, compensatory
damages, costs and expenses, and such other further relief as
the Court deems just and proper. On December28, 2006,
pursuant to motion by defendants, the U.S.District Court
for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania transferred this action
to the U.S.District Court for the District of Arizona.   Shareholder
Derivative Lawsuits   On February23, 2006, a purported shareholder derivative
lawsuit entitled Scimecav. Kim, etal. was
filed in the U.S.District Court for the District of
Arizona against certain of Amkors current and former
officers and directors. Amkor is named as a nominal defendant.
In September 2006 and again in November 2006, the plaintiff
amended the complaint to add allegations relating to option
grants and added additional defendants, including the remaining
members of the current board, former board members, and former
officers. The complaint includes claims for violation of
Section14a of the Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary
duty, abuse of control, waste of corporate assets, unjust
enrichment and mismanagement, and is generally based on the same
allegations as in the securities class action litigation
described above.   On March2, 2006, a purported shareholder derivative
lawsuit entitled Kahnv. Kim, etal. was filed
in the Superior Court of the State of Arizona against certain of
Amkors current and former officers and directors. Amkor is
named as a nominal defendant. The complaint includes claims for
breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment, and is based on
allegations similar to those made in the previously filed
federal shareholder derivative action. This action has been
stayed pending resolution of the federal derivative suit
referenced above.   On or about October10, 2006, a purported shareholder
derivative lawsuit entitled Feldgusv. Kim,
etal. was filed in the Superior Court of the State of
Arizona against certain of Amkors current and former
officers and directors. Amkor is named as a nominal defendant.
The complaint includes claims for breach of fiduciary duty and
unjust enrichment and contains allegations relating to option
grants similar to those made in the previously filed federal
shareholder derivative action referred to above. This action has
been stayed pending resolution of the federal derivative suit
referenced above.   The derivative complaints seek monetary damages, an order
directing the Company to take all necessary actions to improve
corporate governance as may be necessary, equitable
and/or
injunctive relief as permitted by law, disgorgement,
restitution, costs, fees, expenses and such other relief as the
Court deems just and proper.   Securities
and Exchange Commission Investigation   In August 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission
SEC issued a formal order of investigation
regarding certain activities with respect to Amkor securities.
The primary focus of the investigation appears to be activities
during the period from June 2003 to July 2004. We believe that
the investigation continues to relate primarily to transactions
in our securities by certain individuals, and that the
investigation may in part relate to whether tipping with respect
to trading in our securities occurred. The matters at issue
involve activities with respect to Amkor securities during the
subject period by certain insiders or former insiders and
persons or entities associated with them, including activities
by or on behalf of certain current and former members of the
Board of Directors and Amkors Chief Executive Officer.
Amkor has cooperated fully with the SEC on the formal
investigation and the informal inquiry that preceded it. Amkor
cannot predict the outcome of the investigation. We have learned
that our former general counsel, whose employment with us
terminated in March of 2005, has been indicted by the United
States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania for violation of the   
102 Table of Contents   AMKOR
TECHNOLOGY, INC.
Notes to
Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   securities laws. The indictment alleges that the former general
counsel traded in Amkor securities on the basis of material
non-public information.   As described in Note2, Restatement of Stock-based
Compensation Expense from 1998 through March 2006, Special
Committee and Company Findings Relating to Stock Options,
in July 2006, the Board of Directors established a Special
Committee to review our historical stock option practices and
informed the SEC of these efforts. The SEC informed us that it
is expanding the scope of its investigation and has requested
that we provide documentation related to these matters. We
intend to continue to cooperate with the SEC. Additionally, we
have voluntarily provided information to the Department of
Justice relating to our historical stock option practices.   Amkor
Technology, Inc.v. Motorola, Inc.   In August 2002, we filed a complaint against Motorola, Inc.
Motorola seeking declaratory judgment relating to
a controversy between us and Motorola concerning: ithe
assignment by Citizen Watch Co., Ltd. Citizen to
us of a Patent License Agreement dated January25, 1996
between Motorola and Citizen the License Agreement
and concurrent assignment by Citizen to us of Citizens
interest in U.S.Patents 5,241,133 and 5,216,278 the
133 and 278 Patents which patents
relate to ball grid array packages; and iiour obligation
to make certain payments pursuant to an immunity agreement the
Immunity Agreement dated June30, 1993 between
us and Motorola, pending in the Superior Court of the State of
Delaware in and for New Castle County.   We and Motorola resolved the controversy with respect to all
issues relating to the Immunity Agreement, and all claims and
counterclaims filed by the parties in the case relating to the
Immunity Agreement were dismissed or otherwise disposed of
without further litigation. The claims relating to the License
Agreement and the 133 and 278 Patents remained
pending.   We and Motorola both filed motions for summary judgment on the
remaining claims, and oral arguments were heard in September
2003. On October6, 2003, the Superior Court of Delaware
ruled in favor of us and issued an Opinion and Order granting
our motion for summary judgment and denying Motorolas
motion for summary judgment. Motorola filed an appeal in the
Supreme Court of Delaware. In May 2004, the Supreme Court
reversed the Superior Courts decision, and remanded for
further development of the factual record. The bench trial in
this matter was concluded on January27, 2006. Post-trial
briefs were submitted and post-trial oral arguments were heard
by the Court in April 2006. Additional post-trial oral arguments
were heard by the Court on September11, 2006. A decision
from the Court is still pending. Although we believe that we
have meritorious claims in this matter and will continue to seek
judgment in our favor, as of the date of this Annual Report, it
is not possible to predict the outcome of this litigation or the
total cost of resolving this controversy, including the impact
of possible future claims for royalties which may be made by
Motorola if the final outcome is unfavorable. The final
resolution of this controversy could result in potential
liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   Alcatel
Business Systemsv. Amkor Technology, Inc., Anam
Semiconductor, Inc.   On November5, 1999, we agreed to sell certain
semiconductor parts to Alcatel Microelectronics, N.V.
AME, a subsidiary of Alcatel S.A. The parts were
manufactured for us by Anam Semiconductor, Inc.
ASI and delivered to AME. AME transferred the
parts to another Alcatel subsidiary, Alcatel Business Systems
ABS, which incorporated the parts into cellular
phone products. In early 2001, a dispute arose as to whether the
parts sold by us were defective.   Paris Commercial Court.On March18,
2002, ABS and its insurer filed suit against us and ASI in the
Paris Commercial Court of France, claiming damages of
approximately 504million Euros approximately
$665million based on the spot exchange rate at
December31, 2006. We have denied all liability and have
not established a loss accrual associated with this claim.
Additionally, we have entered into a written agreement with ASI
whereby ASI has agreed to indemnify us fully against any and all
loss related to the claims of AME, ABS and ABS insurer.
Dongbu Electronics, successor in interest to ASI, has
acknowledged that it is the indemnifying party with respect to

StatementsContinued   claims against us in this matter and in the Arbitration matter
described below. The Paris Commercial Court commenced a special
proceeding before a technical expert to report on the facts of
the dispute. The report of the court-appointed expert was put
forth on December31, 2003. The report does not
specifically allocate liability to any particular party. On
May18, 2004, the Paris Commercial Court of France declared
that it did not have jurisdiction over the matter. The Court of
Appeal of Paris heard the appeal regarding jurisdiction during
October 2004, confirmed the first tier ruling and dismissed the
appeal on November3, 2004. A motion was filed by ABS and
its insurer before the French Supreme Court to challenge the
lack of jurisdiction ruling and a brief was filed by ABS and its
insurer in June 2005. We filed a response brief before the
French Supreme Court in August 2005. A hearing on the pending
motion is expected as early as the first quarter of 2007,
although it is not clear when a final ruling by the French
Supreme Court will be issued.   Arbitration.In response to the French lawsuit
described above, on May22, 2002, we filed a petition to
compel arbitration in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania U.S.District Court
proceeding against ABS, AME and ABS insurer,
claiming that the dispute is subject to the arbitration clause
of the November5, 1999 agreement between us and AME. The
U.S.District Court proceeding has been stayed pending
resolution of the French lawsuit described above. Until
recently, ABS had refused to arbitrate. However, in December
2006, ABS filed a demand for arbitration under the 1999
agreement, which demand is based on substantially the same
claims raised in the French lawsuit described above.   Amkor
Technology, Inc.v. Carsem MSdn Bhd, Carsem
Semiconductor Sdn Bhd, and Carsem Inc.   In November 2003, we filed a complaint against Carsem
MSdn Bhd, Carsem Semiconductor Sdn Bhd, and Carsem Inc.
collectively Carsem with the International Trade
Commission ITC in Washington,D.C., alleging
infringement of our United States Patent Nos. 6,433,277;
6,455,356 and 6,630,728 collectively the Amkor
Patents and seeking an exclusionary order barring the
importation by Carsem of infringing products. Subsequently, we
filed a complaint in the Northern District of California,
alleging infringement of the Amkor Patents and seeking an
injunction enjoining Carsem from further infringing the Amkor
Patents, treble damages plus interest, costs and attorneys
fees. We allege that by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing into the U.S.the Carsem Dual and Quad
Flat No-Lead Package, Carsem has infringed on one or more of our
MicroLeadFrame packaging technology claims in the Amkor
Patents. The District Court action had been stayed pending
resolution of the ITC case. The ITC Administrative Law Judge
ALJ conducted an evidentiary hearing during July
and August of 2004 in Washington D.C. and issued an initial
determination that Carsem infringed some of our patent claims
relating to our MicroLeadFrame package technology, that
some of our 21 asserted patent claims are valid, and that all of
our asserted patent claims are enforceable. However, the ALJ did
not find a statutory violation of the Tariff Act. We filed a
petition in November 2004 to have the ALJs ruling reviewed
by the full International Trade Commission. The ITC ordered a
new claims construction related to various disputed claim terms
and remanded the case to the ALJ for further proceedings. On
November9, 2005, the ALJ issued an Initial Determination
that Carsem infringed some of our patent claims and ruled that
Carsem violated Section337 of the Tariff Act. The ITC
subsequently authorized the ALJ to reopen the record on certain
discovery issues related to third party documents. On
February9, 2006, the ITC ordered a delay in issuance of
the Final Determination, pending resolution of the third party
discovery issues. The discovery issues are the subject of a
subpoena enforcement action which is pending in the District
Court for the District of Columbia. The case we filed in 2003 in
the Northern District of California remains stayed pending
completion of the ITC investigation.   Epoxy
Mold Compound Litigation   Much of our litigation in prior years related to an allegedly
defective epoxy mold compound, formerly used in some of our
packaging services, which was alleged to have been responsible
for certain semiconductor chip failures. As previously
disclosed, the cases of Fujitsu Limitedv. Cirrus Logic,

Business
Segments, Customer Concentrations and Geographic
Information   In accordance with SFASNo131 Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
SFAS No131, in the second quarter of 2006
we determined we had two reportable segments, packaging and
test. Due to the expansion of our test operations, we no longer
met the aggregation criteria under which packaging and test were
previously considered a single reportable segment. We have
included all prior period comparative information on the basis
of the current reportable segments. Packaging and test are
integral parts of the process of manufacturing semiconductor
devices and our customers will engage with us for both packaging
and test services or just packaging or test services. Our
packaging services process creates an electrical interconnect
between the semiconductor chip and the system board through wire
bond or wafer bump technologies. In packaging, individual chips
are separated from the fabricated semiconductor wafers, attached
to a substrate and then encased in a protective material to
provide optimal electrical connectivity and thermal performance.
Our test services include the probing of fabricated wafers and
testing of packaged chips using sophisticated equipment to
ensure that design specifications are satisfied.   The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as
those for our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our
operating segments based on gross margin and gross property,
plant and equipment. We do not specifically identify and
allocate total assets by operating segment. Summarized financial
information concerning reportable segments is shown in the
following table. The other column includes other
corporate adjustments, sales office and corporate property,
plant and equipment.   The following supplementary information presents net sales,

Acquisitions   Acquisitions
of Unitive, Inc. and Unitive Semiconductor Taiwan
Corporation   In August 2004, we acquired approximately 93% of the capital
stock of Unitive, based in North Carolina, and approximately 60%
of the capital stock of UST, a Taiwan-based venture owned by
Unitive and various Taiwanese investors. Unitive and UST are
providers of wafer level technologies and services for flip chip
and wafer level packaging applications. The acquisition of
Unitive and UST provide us with leading-edge technology, a
strong applications development team and high volume production
capacity for 300mm wafers, which contributed to the purchase
price resulting in the recognition of acquired intangible assets
and goodwill.   The purchase price was comprised of $480million, which
included cash consideration due at closing of
$316million, $10million of direct acquisition
costs and $162million or $154million based on the
discounted value due one year after closing, which was paid in
2005. In addition, we assumed $249million of debt. In
December 2004, we acquired the remaining 7% of Unitive. In
January 2006, we exercised an option to acquire an additional
396% of UST for $184million in cash consideration, which
brings our total purchase price to   
107 Table of Contents   AMKOR

StatementsContinued   $664million and our combined ownership to 996% of UST.
Both original transactions provided provisions for contingent,
performance-based earn-outs which could increase the value of
the transactions. With respect to Unitive, the earn-out lapsed
with no additional consideration being paid to the former
owners. With respect to UST, the earn-out is based on the
performance of that subsidiary for the twelve month period ended
January31, 2007. We currently estimate the value of the
earn-out will be approximately $05million. The results of
Unitive and UST operations are included in our Consolidated
Statement of Operations beginning on their dates of acquisition,
August19, 2004 and August20, 2004, respectively. As
of December31, 2006, after acquiring additional shares, we

included a test operation located in Singapore primarily test
equipment and workforce, a 953,000square foot building

assets. These assets were acquired for the purposes of
increasing our packaging and test capacity. The results of our
acquisition have been included in the accompanying consolidated

$1381million, consisting of $1170million of
short-term notes payable net of a $46million discount,
$200million paid at closing and other acquisition costs
of $11million. The short-term notes payable, and interest
thereon of $46million, was paid during the fourth quarter

in Japan   In January 2004, we acquired the remaining 40% ownership
interest in Amkor Iwate Corporation AIC from
Toshiba for $129million, bringing our total ownership
percentage to 100%. Also in January 2004, we paid to Toshiba
2200million Japanese yen, or approximately
$20million, to terminate our commitment to purchase a
tract of land adjacent to the Amkor Iwate facility. A
$20million charge was recorded in selling, general and
administrative expenses during the fourth quarter of 2003
related to this termination fee. AIC provides packaging and test
services principally to Toshibas adjacent Iwate factory
under a long-term supply agreement, which automatically renews
annually by mutual consent. The difference between the purchase

minority interest liability of $119million was recorded
as an adjustment to the carrying values of the assets and
liabilities of AIC. This step acquisition adjustment was
recorded based on the proportion of the minority interest
acquired as follows

Restructuring
and Reduction in Force   During the third and fourth quarter of 2006 we implemented an
early voluntary retirement program with special termination
benefits to employees at our Korean subsidiary. We recorded a
charge for the special termination benefits of
$54million, including $47million charged to cost
of sales and $07million charged to selling, general and
administrative expenses. All of these charges were paid as of
December31, 2006.   During 2005, we terminated the operations of Semisys, a
Korean-based subsidiary which produced molds and other equipment
used in semiconductor packaging. We recorded a charge of
$30million related to this shut-down, of which
$24million impacted gross profit and $06million
was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.
The charges were related to the write-down of assets and the
accrual of severance and other exit costs. All severance
benefits were paid as of December31, 2005.   During the third quarter of 2005, we temporarily assigned excess
manufacturing labor force at one of our Japanese subsidiaries to
one of our customers. This agreement resulted in a charge of
$38million, including $34million charged to cost
of sales and $04million charged to selling, general and
administrative expenses. The charge represents wage and benefit
costs in excess of the reimbursement from the customer. During
the third quarter of 2006, an extension of the agreement
resulted in an additional charge of $07million, primarily
included in cost of sales. Approximately $03million is
remaining to be paid as of December31, 2006.   During the third and fourth quarter of 2005, we charged
$40million to selling, general and administrative
expenses associated with a reduction in force at our Chandler,
Arizona corporate headquarters. All of these charges have been
paid as of December31, 2006.   During the third quarter of 2004, we commenced efforts related
to the relocation of certain corporate functions from our West
Chester, Pennsylvania location to our Chandler, Arizona
location. In connection with these efforts, we recorded
$12million in severance and related costs. Of this
$12million, we recorded a charge of $09million to

Sale of
Specialty Test Operations   In October 2005, we sold Amkor Test Services, a specialty test
operation based in Wichita, Kansas, which did not meet the
definition of a discontinued operation. The selling price was
$82million, which included a $69million cash
payment at closing and a 50%note in the amount of
$13million due October 2011. A 15% discount of
$04million was recorded on the note at the time of sale
which equates to an effective interest rate of 145%. We
recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $44million in
connection with this sale.   At December31, 2006 and 2005, the $13million note
receivable, reduced by the unamortized discount of
$03million, is included in other assets.

Controls
and Procedures   Restatement
of Stock-based Compensation Expense from 1998 through
March2006, Special Committee and Company Findings Relating
to Stock Options   In October 2006, we restated our historical consolidated
financial statements included in our 2005 Annual Report on
Form10-K
and restated certain other historical financial information
relating to accounting for stock options. As a result of a
report by a third party financial analyst issued on May25,
2006, we commenced an initial review of our historical stock
option granting practices. This review included a review of hard
copy documents as well as a limited set of electronic documents.
Following this initial review, on July24, 2006 our Board
of Directors established a Special Committee comprised of
independent directors to conduct a review of our historical
stock option granting practices since our initial public
offering in 1998 through June30, 2006.   Based on the findings of the Special Committee and our internal
review, we identified a number of occasions on which we used an
incorrect measurement date for financial accounting and
reporting purposes. In accordance with APB No25, and
related interpretations, with respect to the period through
December31, 2005, we should have recorded compensation
expense in an amount per share subject to each option to the
extent that the fair market value of our stock on the correct
measurement date exceeded the exercise price of the option. For
periods commencing January1, 2006, compensation expense is
recorded in accordance with SFAS No123R. We have also
identified a number of other option grants for which we failed
to properly apply the provisions of APB No25 or SFAS
No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFASNo123 and related interpretations
of each pronouncement. In considering the causes of the
accounting errors set forth below, the Special Committee
concluded that the evidence did not support a finding of
intentional manipulation of stock option grant pricing by any
member of existing management. However, based on its review, the
Special Committee identified evidence that supported a finding
of intentional manipulation of stock option pricing with respect
to the annual grants in 2001 and 2002 by a former executive and
that other former executives may have been aware of, or
participated in, this conduct. In addition, the Special
Committee identified a number of other factors related to our
internal controls that contributed to the accounting errors that
led to the October 2006 restatement of our prior filings.   Improper Measurement Dates for Annual Stock Option
Grants.We determined that, in connection with
our annual stock option grants to employees in 1999, 2000, 2001,
2002 and 2004, the number of shares that an individual employee
was entitled to receive was not determined until after the
original grant date, and therefore the measurement date for such
options was subsequent to the original grant date. As a result,
we restated our financial information to increase stock-based
compensation expense by a total of $956million recognized
over the applicable vesting periods. For certain of these
options forfeited in 2002 in connection with an option exchange
program 2002 Option Exchange Program, the
remaining compensation expense was accelerated into 2002. For
certain other options, compensation expense was accelerated into
2004, in connection with the acceleration of all unvested
options as of July1, 2004 2004 Accelerated
Vesting. We undertook the 2004 Accelerated Vesting
program for the purpose of enhancing employee morale, helping
retain high potential employees in the face of a downturn in
industry conditions and to avoid future compensation charges
subsequent to the adoption of SFASNo123R.   Modifications to Stock Option Grants.We
determined that from 1998 through 2005, we had not properly
accounted for stock options modified for certain individuals who
held consulting, transition or advisory roles with us. These
included instances of continued vesting after an individual was
no longer required to provide substantive services to Amkor
after an individual converted from an employee to a consultant
or advisory role, and extensions of option vesting and exercise
periods. Some of these modifications were not identified in our
financial reporting processes and were therefore not properly
reflected in our financial statements. As a result, we restated
our financial information to increase stock-based compensation
expense by a total of $95million recognized as of the
date of the respective modifications.   
112 Table of Contents   Improper Measurement Dates for Other Stock Option
Grants.We determined that from 1998 through
2005, we had not properly accounted for certain employee stock
options granted prior to obtaining authorization of the grants.
These options included those granted as of November9, 1998
in connection with the settlement of a deferred compensation
liability to employees that had not been approved by our Board
of Directors until November10, 1998 as well as stock
options granted to new hires and existing employees in
recognition of achievements, promotions, retentions and other
events. As a result of these errors, we restated our financial
information to increase stock-based compensation expense by a
total of $21million recognized over the applicable
vesting periods. For certain of these option grants, the
recognition of this expense was also accelerated under the 2002
Option Exchange Program or the 2004 Accelerated Vesting, as
described under Improper Measurement Dates for Annual
Stock Option Grants.   Stock Option Grants to Non-employees.We
determined that from 1998 to 2004, we had not properly accounted
for stock option grants issued to employees of an equity
affiliate, consultants, or other persons who did not meet the
definition of an employee. We erroneously accounted for such
grants in accordance with APB No25 rather than
SFASNo123 and related interpretations. As a result,
we restated our financial information to increase stock-based
compensation expense by a total of $16million.   As a result of the findings of the Special Committee as well as
our internal review, we amended our Annual Report on
Form10-K
for the year ended December31, 2005, filed on
October6, 2006, to restate our consolidated financial
statements for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and
2003 and the related disclosures. The amended 2005
Form10-K/A
included restated balance sheet and income statement data for
1998 through 2002 within Item7. That amended filing also
included the restated selected consolidated financial data as of
and for each of the five years ended December31, 2005,
which is included in Item6 of the 2005
Form10-K/A,
and the unaudited quarterly financial data for each of the
quarters in the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004,
which is included in Item7 of the 2005
Form10-K/A.
We amended our Quarterly Report on
Form10-Q
for the quarter ended March31, 2006, filed on
October6, 2006 to restate our condensed consolidated
financial statements for the quarters ended March31, 2006
and 2005 and the related disclosures. We also restated the
June30, 2005 condensed consolidated financial statements
and related disclosures included in our Quarterly Report on
Form10-Q
for the quarter ended June30, 2006, filed on
October6, 2006. We restated the condensed consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures for the periods
ended September30, 2005 included in our Quarterly Report
on
Form10-Q
for the quarter ended September30, 2006 filed on
November8, 2006; however, such information was also
previously filed on Exhibit991 included in our 2005
Form10-K/A.   Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Our management, with the participation of our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as
defined in
Rules13a-15e
and 15d-15 eunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended the Exchange Act as of
December31, 2006. Based on this evaluation, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of
December31, 2006 as a result of the material weaknesses
described below in Managements Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting.   Managements
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act
Rules13a-15f
and
15d-15f.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.   Internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of   
113 Table of Contents   unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.   Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2006 based on the framework established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. A material weakness is a control
deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results
in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of
the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected. We previously reported the following material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in
our 2005
Form10-K/A,
filed on October6, 2006. These material weaknesses
continued to exist, as they were not remediated as of
December31, 2006.   1.We did not maintain effective governance and oversight,
controls to prevent or detect instances of management override,
and risk assessment procedures. Specifically, we failed to
establish effective governance and oversight by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors of our activities related to
the granting of stock options. Additionally, controls were not
effective in adequately identifying, assessing and addressing
significant risks associated with the granting of stock options
that could impact our financial reporting. Finally, our controls
were not adequate to prevent or detect instances of potential
misconduct by members of senior management. This control
deficiency resulted in the restatement of our consolidated
financial information for each of the years ended from 1998
through 2005, for each of the quarters of 2005 and 2004, as well
as for the first quarter of 2006. Additionally, this control
deficiency could result in misstatements of our financial
statement accounts and disclosures that would result in a
material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated
financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.
Accordingly, our management has determined that this control
deficiency constitutes a material weakness. This material
weakness also contributed to the existence of the following
additional material weakness.   2.We did not maintain effective controls over our
accounting for and disclosure of our stock-based compensation
expense. Specifically, effective controls, including monitoring,
were not maintained to ensure the existence, completeness,
accuracy, valuation and presentation of activity related to our
granting and modification of stock options. This control
deficiency resulted in the misstatement of our stock-based
compensation expense and additional paid-in capital accounts and
related disclosures, and in the restatement of our consolidated
financial information for each of the years ended from 1998
through 2005, for each of the quarters of 2005 and 2004, as well
as for the first quarter of 2006. Additionally, this control
deficiency could result in misstatements of the aforementioned
accounts and disclosures that would result in a material
misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial
statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly,
our management has determined that this control deficiency
constitutes a material weakness.   Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that the material weaknesses described above existed,
as they were not remediated as of December31, 2006. As a
result, we concluded that we did not maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006,
based on the criteria in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.   Managements assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2006 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing under
Item8.   
114 Table of Contents   Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   The following were changes in our internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal
quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect our internal control over financial
reporting.   Remediation
Activities Relating to Material Weaknesses   As of December31, 2006, we completed our redesign of
internal controls to remediate the material weaknesses described
above and we were substantially complete with our remediation
efforts but we did not have sufficient time to assess operating
effectiveness of the improved internal control over financial
reporting. We expect our remediation efforts and testing to be
completed prior to the filing of our March 2007
Form10-Q.
Our remediation efforts include the following changed or
additional control procedures to remediate the material
weaknesses   
We created and implemented formal, documented stock award grant
procedures and practices to ensure systematic approval and
execution of stock award grants and the proper recording of such
grants in our stock administration records and financial
statements   
We conducted additional training for personnel and will conduct
training for directors in areas associated with the stock award
granting processes and other compensation practices. We also
conducted training related to accounting for stock-based
compensation;and   
We improved the manner of documenting the actions of the
Compensation Committee and we are ensuring the timely reporting
of Compensation Committee actions to the Board of Directors.   Other
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   Additionally, we have made changes in our internal control over
financial reporting, unrelated to the material weaknesses, in
conjunction with the implementation of a new Enterprise Resource
Planning system at two of our subsidiaries which have materially
changed our internal control over financial reporting. We expect
that we will complete our implementation efforts at our largest
subsidiary during the third quarter of 2007.
