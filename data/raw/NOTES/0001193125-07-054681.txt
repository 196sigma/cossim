MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING 1 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by our Board of Directors,
management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all error and all fraud.
A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we undertook an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on the framework in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our managements assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial
reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls. Based upon this assessment, our management has concluded that,
as of December31, 2006, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We reviewed the results of managements assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. This annual report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Companys independent registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by the Companys independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit
the Company to provide only managements report in this annual report.  1
Based on the aggregate market value of the Companys common shares held by non-affiliates as of
June30, 2006, the Company has determined, as of December31, 2006, that it is no longer an accelerated filer, but rather is a non-accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. Pursuant to SEC Final Rule 33-8760, the
Company is not required to furnish a management report on internal control over financial reporting in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company is voluntarily furnishing this report.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Organization: Dominion Homes, Inc. the Company is engaged primarily in the construction and sale of single-family homes in Central Ohio and Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky. The Company designs, sells and builds
single-family homes on finished lots. The Company also purchases undeveloped land to develop into finished lots as needed for home construction. The Company provides title insurance services through affiliated title insurance agencies and mortgage
financing services through a joint venture arrangement. Basis of Presentation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company, its consolidated subsidiaries, variable interest entities in which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and joint venture investments accounted for using the equity method see Note 3.
Inter-company transactions are eliminated. The Company owns a 499% interest in Alliance Title Agency, Ltd. Alliance, a
title insurance agency that provides closing services for our Central Ohio home sales. The Company determined that Alliance is a variable interest entity in which the Company is the primary beneficiary and has therefore included Alliance in its
consolidated results. Minority interest related to Alliance is included in accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During
2006 the Company incurred a net loss of $340 million compared to net income of $53 million in 2005 and net income of $202 million in 2004. The homebuilding industry is cyclical and significantly affected by changes in national and local economic,
business and other conditions. During 2004 new home sales in our markets began to slow and that trend continued through 2006. Factors contributing to this slowdown were ia decline in the overall demand for new homes, iiincreased
price competition and slowing sales in the resale home market, iiian increased supply of existing home inventory, ivhigher mortgage interest rates compared to prior years, vlower consumer confidence and vislower
economic activity in our markets. In response to these concerns, the Company has significantly reduced selling, general and administrative expenses in order to align our cost structure with the current level of sales activity, slowed all land
acquisition, delayed land development and construction activities except where required for near term sales and has offered for sale various developed lots and land parcels that the Company believes are not needed based on current absorption rates.
As a result of the 2006 net loss the Company was required to execute various amendments to its credit facility and obtain waivers with
respect to various financial covenants during 2006. On December29, 2006, the Company amended its credit facility and extended its due date from May31, 2007 to December29, 2010. The amended credit agreement includes: ia $35
million senior secured revolving line of credit, iia $110 million senior secured Term A loan facility and iiia $90 million senior secured second lien Term B loan facility with detachable warrants exercisable for 1,538,235 common
shares of the Company. The amended credit agreement contains new financial covenants that commence March31, 2007 and extend through the term of the agreement. The Company expects to comply with the financial covenants under the amended credit
agreements for the next twelve months. Non-compliance with such covenants would allow the lenders to demand immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings under 
52 Table of Contents
the facility. The inability of the Company to comply with its financial covenants, obtain waivers for non-compliance or obtain alternative financing to
replace the current credit facility would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Segment Information: The Companys homebuilding operations conducted in Ohio and Kentucky have been determined to have similar economic characteristics including similar historical and expected future
operating performance, similar product offerings, pricing and margins, which otherwise meet the criteria for aggregation in accordance with SFAS No131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Relation Information.
The Companys title operations directly support its homebuilding operations and services to outside parties are rare. Therefore, the homebuilding operations and title operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment the
homebuilding segment. Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and
Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of December31, 2006, the Companys cash equivalents were comprised of money
market funds. Restricted Cash: Under the terms of its Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated December29, 2006, the
Company was required to place funds on deposit in an amount equal to its outstanding letters of credit. The funds must remain on deposit until the related letter of credit expires or is cancelled and returned to the issuing bank. As of
December31, 2006, the Company maintained $6,762,000 of restricted cash related to its letters of credit. Real Estate
Inventories: Real estate inventories are recorded at cost. Land and land development costs include capitalized acquisition related costs, land construction costs, capitalized interest, and real estate taxes. Certain land and land development
costs are allocated to development phases based on the number of lots expected to be developed within each subdivision. As each development phase is completed, those land and land development costs are then allocated to individual lots. Homes under
construction include land and land development costs, construction costs, capitalized interest and indirect costs related to development and construction activities. Indirect costs that do not relate to development and construction activities,
including general and administrative expenses, are charged to expense as incurred. Land held for sale includes unimproved land, lots under
development and developed lots that no longer fit into the Companys development plans, and that the Company is currently marketing for sale or is under contract to sell. Land held for sale is valued at the lower of cost or fair value less
estimated costs to sell. 
53 Table of Contents
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its real estate inventories in accordance with SFAS
No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, using several factors including, but not limited to, the recent level of sales activity, estimated average selling prices, estimated sales, absorption rates, gross
margin trends, projected cash flows and planned development activities for the Company. The Company records impairment charges based upon a discounted cash flow analysis to reduce inventory carrying values to fair value in those instances where the
cost is not expected to be recovered as a result of either the construction and delivery of a new home or through the sale of land parcel or lot The Company recognized impairment charges, included in cost of real estate sold, of $14,175,000, $6,491,000, and $4,800,000 for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. The impairment charges consist of write-downs of
inventory carrying value to fair values, adjustments to the carrying value of certain parcels of land held for sale to fair value and reserves and write-offs of acquisition costs and deposits for land the Company decided not to purchase. 
Capitalized Interest: The Company capitalizes interest costs during the land development and home construction periods. Capitalized interest is
included in land and land development costs and homes under construction in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized interest related to the costs of land development and home construction is included in cost of real estate sold in the period
for which the home is closed. A summary of interest expense and a reconciliation of changes in capitalized interest for the years ended
December31 is as follows:  2006 2005 2004 Interest incurred 17,644,000 12,477,000 9,726,000 Interest capitalized 6,396,000 4,732,000 5,694,000 Interest expense 11,248,000 7,745,000 4,032,000  2006 2005 2004 Capitalized interest, beginning of year 5,007,000 4,598,000 3,108,000 Interest capitalized 6,396,000 4,732,000 5,694,000 Capitalized interest charged to cost of real estate sold 3,664,000 4,323,000 4,204,000 Capitalized interest, end of year 7,739,000 5,007,000 4,598,000 Prepaid expenses and other: Prepaid expenses and other consisted of the following as of
December31:  2006
2005
Debt issuance costs 1,507,000 391,000
Income taxes receivable 11,081,000 1,901,000
Cash value of Company owned life insurance 3,027,000 2,853,000
Interest rate swap agreements 2,696,000
Other 869,000 951,000 Total prepaid expenses and other 16,484,000 8,792,000 Debt Issuance Costs: Fees and costs incurred in connection with our revolving credit
agreements are capitalized as other assets and are included in prepaid expenses and other in the 
54 Table of Contents
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fees and costs associated with the Companys Term A and Term B notes are recorded as a debt discount. These debt issuance
costs are amortized to interest expense over the terms of the respective agreements. As of December31, 2006 and 2005, debt issuance costs were $1,507,000 and $391,000, respectively. The Company recorded amortization expense of $1,598,000 446,000 and $528,000 related to debt issuance costs for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Amortization expense in 2006 includes $368,000 of debt issuance costs written off upon the Company entering into the Third
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated December29, 2006. The charge represents the portion of debt issuance costs associated with the extinguished portion of the previous credit facility outstanding as of December29, 2006 that were
not considered to relate to the new borrowing arrangement going forward. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities: The Company
follows the guidance in SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133, as amended, for accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires that
all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet and measured at fair value. Depending on the purpose of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting treatment, gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of
derivatives are recognized in earnings or recorded in other comprehensive income loss and then recognized in earnings when the hedged item matures or is deemed effective. The Companys policy is to formally document, at the inception of the derivative instrument, the relationship between the derivative instrument and
the specific assets, liabilities, or future commitment being hedged, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedging transaction. The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
During the three years ended December31, 2006, the Companys only hedging activity has been the execution of cash flow hedges
through the use of various interest rate swap agreements, effectively converting the variable interest rates to fixed interest rates on a portion of its outstanding debt. As of December31, 2005, the Company had recorded an asset of $2,696,000
related to the fair value of its interest rate swaps in prepaid expenses and other, with an offsetting credit in accumulated other comprehensive income. In late October 2006, the Company liquidated its interest rate swap agreements for cash proceeds
of $2,051,000. The liquidation resulted in an unrealized gain which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income. The unrealized gain is being amortized to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the original contract term of the
interest rate swap agreements, which were set to expire at various dates through June 2009. As of December31, 2006, accumulated other comprehensive income included $1,608,000 of unrealized gain related to the terminated interest rate swap
agreements. Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The asset and liability
method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of the Companys assets and
liabilities. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely 
55 Table of Contents
than not that some or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets
when it is more likely than not that a portion of such deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Property and Equipment:
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are recognized on the straight-line method at rates adequate to amortize costs over the estimated useful lives of the applicable assets. The
estimated useful lives of assets range from three to forty years. Depreciation and amortization expense was $2,427,000, $2,875,000 and $2,155,000 for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Property and equipment includes assets subject to capital leases with a cost of $281,000 and related accumulated amortization of $23,000 as of
December31, 2006. Property and equipment under capital lease primarily includes computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. There were no capital lease assets as of December31, 2005. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to expense as incurred while major renewals and betterments are capitalized and amortized over the
estimated useful lives of the applicable assets. The cost and accumulated depreciation for assets sold or retired is removed, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations. The Company assesses the impairment of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may
not be recoverable from its future undiscounted cash flows. If it is determined that an impairment has occurred, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company
did not record any impairment losses for the years ended December31, 2006 or 2005. The Company recognized an impairment loss related to property and equipment of $186,000 for the year ended December31, 2004. Warranty Costs: The Company provides a two-year warranty covering the roof, windows, doors and all mechanical elements of its homes, including the
heating, plumbing and electrical systems. The Company also offers a 30-year warranty covering all major structural components in its Celebration and Celebration Classic Series, Independence Collection and Tradition Series homes and a 10-year
structural warranty on its Metropolitan Series and Grand Reserve Series homes. The Company initially provides an estimated amount of warranty cost for each home at the date of closing based on historical warranty experience. The Company periodically
evaluates the adequacy of the reserve based on its experience. Factors that affect the Companys warranty liability include the number of homes closed, historical warranty claims and cost per claim. 
56 Table of Contents
A reconciliation of the changes in the warranty liability for the years ended December31 is as
follows:  2006 2005 2004 Balance at the beginning of the period 2,010,000 3,175,000 3,990,000 Warranty expense 1,236,000 789,000 1,179,000 Settlements made in cash or in kind during the period 1,419,000 1,954,000 1,994,000 Balance at the end of the period 1,827,000 2,010,000 3,175,000 Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable and accounts payable are reasonable estimates of fair value due to the short period of time to maturity or settlement. The fair value of the Companys debt approximates the carrying value due to the interest terms being
primarily variable. The portion of the Companys debt at a fixed rate was priced on December29, 2006, accordingly the carrying value approximates fair value as of December31, 2006. Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenues from the sale of homes, including fees earned for title services, at the time it conveys
title to the home buyer. Accounts receivable due from financial institutions for residential closings represent payments to be received on completed closings. Advertising Costs: The Company expenses advertising costs when incurred. Advertising expense was $4,256,000, $6,259,000 and $6,360,000 for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Earnings Loss per Share: Basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings loss per share is computed similar to basic earnings loss per share except that it reflects the potential dilution that could occur if common share equivalents were
exercised or converted into common shares. Common share equivalents include stock options, restricted shares and warrants. Restricted common shares are included in common share equivalents when performance contingencies, if any, are achieved.
A reconciliation of the weighted average common shares used in basic and diluted earnings loss per share computations is as follows:

As of December31, 2005 and 2004, there were 60,000 restricted shares excluded from the computations
of diluted earnings per share because the performance contingencies related to those shares had not been achieved. Share-Based
Compensation: Prior to January1, 2006, the Company accounted for its stock option and restricted share awards under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. As a result, no compensation cost was previously recognized for stock option awards granted to employees because all stock option awards granted have exercise prices equal to the market value of
the underlying common shares of the Company on the grant date. Compensation cost related to restricted share awards was determined at the date of grant and adjusted for changes in the fair value of the restricted shares until the performance
criteria, if applicable, was met. The fair value of the restricted share awards was recorded as unearned compensation expense, a reduction of shareholders equity, and amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. As of January1, 2006, the Company adopted FAS No123R, Share-Based Payment FAS 123R, which revises FAS No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. FAS 123R applies to all new awards granted, all awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the required effective date, and to the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding as of
the required effective date. FAS 123R requires all share-based payments, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. The Company has elected to apply the modified
prospective approach for existing share-based payment awards outstanding at the date of adoption. The method requires the Company to value stock options and non-vested share awards granted prior to the adoption of FAS 123R under the fair value
method and recognized expense for the unvested portion of awards over the remaining vesting period. The following table illustrates the
pro-forma effects on net income and earnings per share as if the Company had accounted for share-based compensation expense using the fair value method, as required by FAS 123R, for the years ended December31:  2005 2004

The Company generally grants share-based compensation awards using authorized but previously unissued
common shares. The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to value its new stock option award grants under FAS 123R. Non-vested share awards
granted to employees are valued based on the market price of the Companys common shares on the date of grant. The Company estimates forfeitures in calculating the compensation expense related to all share-based payment awards. Compensation
cost arising from stock option and non-vested share awards granted to employees is recognized as expense using the straight-line method over the vesting period. In addition, FAS 123R requires the Company to report the benefits of tax deductions in
excess of recognized compensation cost as both a financing cash inflow and an operating cash outflow. There were no such benefits recorded during 2006. As indicated, the fair value of new stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatilities are
based on historical volatility of the Companys shares. The Company uses historical data to estimate stock option exercise dates and the period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rates for periods within
the contractual life of the stock option are based on the U.S. treasury yield curve at the time of stock option grant.  2006 2005 2004 Expected volatility

502 420 350 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements: In May 2005, the FASB issued FAS No154,
Accounting for Changes and Error Corrections A Replacement of APB Opinion No20 and FASB Statement No3 FAS 154. FAS 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting
principle. FAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principles, unless it is impractical to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of a change. FAS 154
became effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. The adoption of FAS 154 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of
operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No157, Fair Value Measurements FAS 157, which provides
guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. FAS 157 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting FAS 157 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment
of FASB Statement No115 FAS 159. FAS 159 permits all entities to choose to measure and report many financial instruments 
59 Table of Contents
and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. If such an election is made, any unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair
value option has been elected are required to be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. In addition, FAS 159 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose
different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. FAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The Company is currently considering the potential impact of adopting FAS 159 on its
consolidated financial position and results of operations. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No109 FIN 48. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties and disclosure relating to uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 became effective for the Company on
January1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 is not expected to have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission published Staff Accounting Bulletin No108 Topic 1N, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current
Year Financial Statements SAB 108. SAB 108 provides guidance as to how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in the current financial statements. SAB 108 requires
the Company to quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet and income statement approach, with adjustment required if either method results in a material error. The provisions of SAB 108 were required to be applied December31, 2006. The
application of these provisions did not have an impact on the Companys consolidating financial position or results of operations.  2.
Land Purchase Commitments: As of December31,
2006 and 2005, the Company had non-cancelable contractual obligations to purchase residential lots and unimproved land at an aggregate cost of $0 and $6,152,000, respectively.

cancelable contractual obligations for which the Company determined that it was reasonably likely that it will complete the land or lot purchase. The Company had not made any good faith deposits, or incurred any related pre-acquisition or due
diligence costs related to these cancelable contractual obligations as of December31, 2006. However, $663,000 of performance bonds and irrevocable letters of credit were outstanding as collateral for these cancelable contractual obligations as
of December31, 2006.

recoverability of its investment in joint ventures using the same criteria as for other real estate inventories. The evaluation at December31, 2006 did not indicate any impairment in these real estate investments. The Company accounts for these investments in land development joint ventures using the equity method. The Companys investment in land development
joint ventures, which is included in land and land development costs, was $9,054,000 and $12,459,000 as of December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Term B Notes are secured by second liens granted by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries on
all of its tangible and intangible personal property and substantially all of its real estate, including subsequently-acquired property, as set forth in the Security Agreement. The Term B Notes rank junior to the Revolving Line of Credit and the
Term A Notes. The Term B Notes include comparable, but less restrictive, financial covenants. The Company incurred $3,776,000 of fees and
costs in connection with the establishment of the Term B Notes. These costs are recognized as debt discount and are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method. Warrants Pursuant to a Warrant
Purchase Agreement dated as of December29, 2006, the holders of the Term B Notes received detachable warrants in the aggregate amount of 1,538,235 common shares of the Company. The warrants would constitute approximately 183% of the
Companys common shares outstanding as of December31, 2006 approximately 181% of the Companys common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis assuming that all outstanding options were exercised and all restricted shares were
vested. The warrants are exercisable at $01 per share, and expire 10 years from the grant date. The warrants contain anti-dilution protection, and provide that if the Company issues more than 300,000 shares under its 2003 Stock Option and Equity
Incentive Plan during the next 10 years, the warrant holders will receive additional warrants equal to 175% of the shares issued in excess of 300,000. The agreement also provides that if the original Term B Lenders no longer have the right to designate members for election to the Companys Board of Directors, the warrant purchasers ishall be permitted
to designate two members for election to the Board as long as the purchasers hold more than 1,000,000 warrants or warrant shares, and iishall be permitted to designate one member for election to the Board as long as the purchasers hold more
than 500,000 warrants or warrant shares. As of the date of issuance, the fair value of the warrants is reflected as permanent equity and
included in common shares and as debt discount, a component of term notes, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the warrants was determined using the Noreen-Wolfson valuation model based on the assumptions noted in the following
table. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Companys shares. The risk-free rate for the period the warrants are expected to be outstanding is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve at the time the warrants were issued.

resulting fair value of $6,830,000 assigned to the warrants as permanent equity is included in common shares on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the corresponding amount assigned to the warrants as debt discount on the Term B Notes is being
amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.

Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility The Company executed various other amendments to its credit facility during 2006 prior to the December29, 2006 amendment. On March30, 2006,
the Company and the participant banks in the credit facility amended the facility to, among other things, decrease the amount of the facility, change the borrowing base limitations, revise various financial covenants, impose additional business
restrictions and secure borrowings under the facility by liens on substantially all of the Companys assets, including real estate. On August10, 2006, the Company and the participating banks amended the definition of borrowing base to
increase the Companys potential borrowing base by $10 million from August11, 2006 through September30, 2006. On September29, 2006 and October31, 2006, the Company and its lenders executed amendments to the facility that
waived compliance with the minimum interest coverage ratio covenant at June30, 2006 and September30, 2006, and increased the Companys potential borrowing base by $15,000,000 from October1, 2006 through December31, 2006.
That amendment also increased the borrowing rate to prime rate plus 1%, and required that certain cash proceeds reduce the revolving credit commitment. Prior to the September29, 2006 amendment, the facility included a variable rate of LIBOR rate plus a margin based on the Companys interest coverage ratio, which ranged from 175% to 40%, and was
determined quarterly. The margin was 250% for the first and second quarters of 2006 and 30% for the third quarter of 2006. The September29, 2006 amendment eliminated all LIBOR rate based borrowings subsequent to November6, 2006 and
approved the termination of our existing interest rate swap contracts. All borrowings during the fourth quarter, with the exception of a $1100 million LIBOR advance repaid November6, 2006, were at an interest rate of Prime plus 10%. On
October23, 2006 the Company closed the outstanding positions on the $1100 million of interest rate contracts. An unrealized gain on the settlement of these contracts of $2,051,000 has been deferred and will be recognized as a reduction in
interest expense over the original contract term of the interest rate swap agreements, which were set to expire at various dates through June30, 2009.

it is more likely than not that these deferred tax benefits will be realized, the valuation allowances will be reversed. As of December31, 2006, the Company had state net operating loss carryforwards of $4,603,000 expiring in 2026.

Related Party Transactions: Prior to the
Companys initial public offering of common shares in 1994, its homebuilding operations were part of BRC Properties, Inc. BRC, formerly known as Borror Realty Corporation. BRC owned 3,926,324 common shares of the Company, or
approximately 466% of its outstanding common shares at December31, 2006. The Company leases two office buildings in Central Ohio
from BRC. The first office lease commenced January1, 1998 and has a lease term of twelve years and a triple net rental rate of $1200 per square foot. On December1, 2005, the rental rate was increased to $1260 per square foot due to
building improvements that were paid for by BRC. The lease provides two options for the Company to renew for periods of five years each at then-current market rates. The rental rate for the building was established by an MAI appraiser commissioned
by a committee comprised solely of independent members of the Companys Board of Directors and confirmed in a review by a second MAI appraiser. Lease expense was $434,000, $454,000 and $451,000 for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively. The second office lease commenced November1, 2003, has a lease term of fifteen years and a triple net rental
rate per square foot of $1258 for the first five years, $1318 for the second five years and $1383 for the last five years. The lease also provides for two options for the Company to renew for periods of five years each at then-current market
rates. During 2002, the Company purchased land and contracted to build this second corporate office building. On October31, 2003, the Company sold the corporate office building to BRC for approximately $45 million and leased it back. The
sales price approximated the cost of the land and building. The terms of the sale and leaseback were negotiated based on bids from multiple third parties, reviewed by an MAI appraiser and approved by a committee comprised solely of independent
members of the Companys Board of Directors. Lease expense was $419,000 for 2006, 2005 and 2004. BRC reimbursed the Company $4,800 in
2005 and $9,000 in 2004 for miscellaneous services performed by Company personnel. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company purchased
$32,000, $15,000 and $152,000, respectively, of merchandise from a vendor, of which a member of the Companys Board of Directors is an executive officer and shareholder.

Compensation Plans: Share-Based Compensation
In March 1994, the Company adopted the Dominion Homes, Inc. Incentive Stock Plan, as amended the 1994 Plan. The 1994 Plan
reserved 850,000 common shares for issuance. The Company granted incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted common shares and common shares representing 761,461 issued or issuable common shares during the ten years the 1994
Plan was in existence. In May 2003, the Company adopted the Dominion Homes, Inc. 2003 Stock Option and Incentive Equity Plan the
2003 Plan. The 2003 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, and provides for grants of performance shares, performance units, restricted common shares, incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options
and stock appreciation rights for the purpose of attracting, motivating and retaining employees and eligible directors. The 2003 Plan provides for discretionary grants to employees of the Company and annual non-discretionary non-qualified stock
option grants to purchase 2,500 common shares to each non-employee director. During any single plan year, a plan participant may not be granted stock options and stock appreciation rights affecting more than 50,000 common shares allocated to the
2003 Plan. The 2003 Plan provides that grants shall include certain terms and conditions and be subject to certain restrictions as provided for under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and federal securities laws. In May 2004, the Company amended the 2003 Plan to prohibit the Company from repricing stock options without shareholder approval, and to provide that no
more than a deminimus number of awards granted under the Plan will constitute ioptions with an exercise 
72 Table of Contents
price below fair market values, iitime-based restricted shares of performance stock that vests in less than three years, or
iiiperformance-based restricted shares that vest in less than one year. In addition, in June 2004 the Company amended the 2003 Plan to reduce the Companys obligation to plan participants with respect to excess parachute payments in the
event of a change in control of the Company. In May 2006, the Company amended the
2003 Plan to iincrease the authorized number of common shares available for issuance under the 2003 Plan from 500,000 to 1,250,000 common shares, iiallow for the award of whole shares to independent directors of the Company in lieu
of cash fees for service on the Board of Directors and iiiclarify that the restrictions on exercise price and vesting of awards under the 2003 Plan will not apply to grants of time-based restrictions that vest in equal annual increments of
not more than 331/3%. Grants of options to purchase common shares have an exercise price that is equal to the fair market value of common shares on the grant date 110% of fair market value for incentive stock options granted to 10%
shareholders and are subject to vesting periods ranging from three to five years. Regardless of the vesting period, all options must be exercised within ten years of the grant date five years for incentive stock options granted to 10%
shareholders. Generally, vesting is accelerated in the event of a change in control as defined in the 1994 Plan and the 2003 Plan. A

None 285,000 As of December31, 2006, there was $1,103,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related
to non-vested restricted share awards outstanding. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 269 years. The total fair value of shares vested during 2006 was $315,000. A summary of the Companys total share-based compensation expense benefit for 2006 is as follows:  Vesting of stock option awards 135,000 Reversal of previously recognized share-based compensation expense related to stock options 38,000 Vesting of restricted share awards 762,000 Forfeiture of restricted share awards 718,000 Reversal of previously recognized share-based compensation expense related to restricted share awards 99,000 Share-based compensation expense 42,000 Income tax expense related to share-based compensation awards 34,000 Total share-based compensation expense, net of tax 8,000 During the second quarter of 2006, the Company reversed previously recognized share-based
compensation expense of $616,000 related to 60,000 restricted share awards for which the Company determined the restrictions were not probable of achievement. The 60,000 restricted share awards were forfeited during the fourth quarter of 2006.
During the third quarter of 2006, the Company reversed previously recognized share-based compensation expense of $99,000 related to 117,500 restricted share awards for which the Company determined the restrictions were not probable of achievement.
During the third quarter of 2006, the Company reversed previously recognized share-based compensation expense of $38,000 related to the
modification of an existing stock option award agreement. Share-based compensation expense reflects the fair value of the modified award. Executive
Deferred Compensation The Company sponsors an Amended and Restated Executive Deferred Compensation Plan for directors and certain
executives. Under this plan, participants may elect to defer a portion of their compensation up to 20% of total base and bonus for employees and 100% of director fees. On or around December31 of each year, the Company provides a matching
75 Table of Contents
contribution of 25% of the amount deferred in a given year by a participant, provided that the Companys matching contribution will not exceed $2,500
per participant in any year. The Companys matching contribution vests in 20% increments over a five-year period, subject to accelerated vesting upon a change in control as defined in the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. The Companys
matching contribution becomes 100% vested as of the date on which the sum of participant age and years of service with the Company equals 65. Under the plan, participant and Company matching contributions are used to acquire actual common shares of
Company stock in the open market. These common shares are held and voted by the trustee pursuant to a Rabbi Trust Agreement. The Company
recognized compensation expense related to the Amended and Restated Executive Deferred Compensation Plan of $18,000, $71,000 and $184,000 for the years ending December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The deferred compensation liability
related to the Amended and Restated Executive Deferred Compensation Plan was $744,000 and $949,000 as of December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is reflected as a component of shareholders equity. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan Effective
January1, 2003, the Company established a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan the SERP that provides retirement benefits to eligible employees. A participant qualifies for the retirement benefits under the SERP
if the participant terminates employment, other than because of death, after: 1participating in the SERP for at least 6 years, 2the Companys net worth first exceeds $100,000,000 or a higher amount as specified in his or her
participation agreement, or 3a change in control as defined in the SERP occurs, and if the participants termination: a occurred after the participants retirement age generally, age 55, b was for good reason as defined in
the SERP, regardless of the participant having reached retirement age, or c was without cause as defined in the SERP, regardless of the participant having reached retirement age. The amount of the benefit is determined on account balances
established for each participant to which the Company makes a discretionary annual credit. In June 2004, the Company amended the SERP to
clarify that 1at distribution, a participant may elect to receive the value of his or her account either in cash or by receipt of any insurance policy purchased by the Company as a source of the participants Retirement Plan benefit,
and 2a participant will be fully and immediately vested in his or her account in the event that the SERP is terminated. Upon a
participant satisfying the qualification requirements, the Company is required to make a lump sum distribution to the participant equal to the value of the participants account. If for any reason the above criteria are not met, any accrued
benefits will be recognized as income at that time. The Company expensed $511,000, $140,000 and $185,000 related to the SERP for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As of December31, 2006 and 2005, $1,936,000
and $1,425,000, respectively, were accrued under the SERP. The Company purchased cost recovery life insurance on the lives of the
participants in the SERP. The Company is the sole owner and beneficiary of such policies. The amount of the 
76 Table of Contents
coverage is designed to provide sufficient revenues to cover all costs of the SERP if assumptions made as to policy earnings are realized. As of
December31, 2006 and 2005, the cash surrender value of these policies was $2,832,000 and $2,450,000, respectively.  11.
Commitments and Contingencies: The Company is
often required to obtain performance bonds and irrevocable letters of credit related to our obligations to various municipalities and other individuals with respect to the performance and completion of certain land development activities and as
collateral for contingent land purchase commitments. As of December31, 2006, the Company had $40,408,000 and $6,760,000 of outstanding performance bonds and irrevocable letters of credit, respectively. The expiration dates of irrevocable
letters of credit coincide with the expected completion dates of the related projects. If the obligations related to a project are ongoing, annual extensions of the irrevocable letters of credit are typically granted. Performance bonds do not have
stated expiration dates. The Company is released from performance bonds when the contractual performance is completed. In the event any of the performance bonds or irrevocable letters of credit are called, the Company would be obligated to reimburse
the issuer of the performance bond or irrevocable letter of credit. However, the Company does not believe that any currently outstanding performance bond or irrevocable letter of credit will be called. On February21, 2006, a purported class action lawsuit captioned Stuart, et. al. v. Dominion Homes Financial Services, Inc., et. al., Case
No. C206137 was filed in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, against Dominion Homes Financial Services, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, and National City Mortgage Co. The complaint includes statutory claims,
claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraudulent representations and material omissions in connection with the financing of plaintiffs condominium homes located in the Village at Polaris Park VPP, where the
Company was unable to obtain final HUD approval for FHA-insured mortgages. The plaintiffs purport to bring the claim on behalf of homeowners in VPP who were allegedly promised FHA mortgages through and from the defendants. The complaint seeks
damages, including actual damages, statutory damages, punitive damages, and attorneys fees and costs, for, among other things, the alleged loss of certain FHA-insured mortgage features, including loan assumability. Plaintiffs also seek
statutory damages for the defendants alleged failure to notify plaintiffs of the status of their mortgages. On February21,
2006, a purported class action lawsuit captioned Rece, et. al. v. Dominion Homes, Inc., et. al., Case No06CVH202335 was filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Franklin County, Ohio against the Company, DHFS, named and unnamed appraisers
who have worked with the Company, and unnamed charitable organizations that have provided the Companys customers with down payment assistance funds in the last several years. Plaintiffs purport to bring the claim on behalf of purchasers of the
Companys homes from 1999 to the present who received such funds and allege, among other things, that the defendants misrepresented the value of the plaintiffs homes and obtained an improper benefit by artificially inflating the sales
price of homes to purchasers receiving down payment assistance funds. The complaint also alleges that the defendants engaged in predatory lending practices against the plaintiffs and other consumers by extending them credit without regard to the
actual value of their homes, knowing that the result would be higher default and foreclosure rates in its communities. The complaint seeks injunctive or declaratory relief, compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorneys fees and costs.
77 Table of Contents
On May2, 2006, the Company and DHFS filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to
plaintiffs claim for breach of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act OCSPA on the grounds that this claim was barred by the two-year applicable statute of limitations. On June12, 2006, the Court granted this motion with
respect to plaintiffs claims for money damages under the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, but denied the motion with respect to plaintiffs claim for rescission under the OCSPA. On July28, 2006, the Company and DHFS filed a motion
for summary judgment as to plaintiffs predatory lending claims under statutory and common law. On October4, 2006, the Court granted this motion. On December1, 2006, Defendant Valuation Resources, Inc., the valuation company that
provided appraisals of the Plaintiffs homes for the Company, filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to Plaintiffs claims for fraud, misrepresentation, conspiracy, and OCSPA. On February7, 2007, the Court granted this
motion in its entirety. In addition, on December28, 2006, the Court granted the Companys and DHFSs motions for summary judgment regarding Plaintiffs individual claims and class allegations relating to the OCSPA.
Plaintiffs remaining claims at this time include fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment. On February23,
2006, a similar purported class action lawsuit captioned Rudawsky, et. al. v. Borrer, et. al., Case No. C206144 was filed in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, against the Company, our Chairman, Chief
Executive Officer and President, certain affiliates and current and former officers of the Company, and The Nehemiah Corporation of America by plaintiff homeowners, who purchased homes from the Company using Nehemiah down payment assistance funds.
The complaint alleges, among other things, that plaintiffs suffered financial injuries as a result of the defendants participation in fraudulent conduct related to the Nehemiah down payment assistance program in violation of federal statutes
and Ohio law. The complaint further alleges that defendants fraudulently misrepresented and concealed the cost and operation of the Nehemiah program from plaintiffs. Plaintiffs purport to bring the claim on behalf of customers of the Company who
purchased a home from 1999 to present using down payment assistance from Nehemiah. The complaint seeks monetary damages and attorneys fees and costs. All of the above lawsuits are in the discovery phase. No determination has been made that any of these cases can be maintained as a class action. The Company believes each of these lawsuits is without merit and
intends to vigorously defend against all of the claims and allegations in the complaints. Due to the uncertainty as to the outcome of the foregoing matters, management cannot make an estimate of exposure, if any, at this time. In addition to the foregoing actions, during 2006, the Companys mortgage operations were subjected to review by HUD. On July18, 2006, the
Company received a letter from HUD stating that HUD accepted DHFSs revised Quality Control Plan and closed that matter. In addition, HUD accepted the information supplied by DHFS with respect to all remaining open items under review and
indicated that a further response by DHFS on these findings was not required. On July19, 2006, the Company received a letter from HUD indicating that they had completed their review of the Companys Kentucky operations and closed the
review with no issues raised.

The Company is involved in various other legal proceedings, most of which arise in the ordinary course of
business and some of which are covered by insurance. In the opinion of the Companys management, none of the claims relating to such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the
Company.  12.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and
Procedures With the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we have
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Report
Disclosure Controls. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Companys Disclosure Controls were
effective for the purpose of ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company under the Exchange Act is 1recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified within the Securities and Exchange
Commissions rules and forms; and 2accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure in our periodic Exchange Act reports. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
See Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Part II, Item8 of this Report
entitled Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Although this Report is not required, given that the Company is a non-accelerated SEC filer as of December31, 2006, it is being voluntarily furnished by management. 
Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee, has addressed the material weakness related to the Companys restatement of its quarterly consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended March31, 2006 and
for the six month period ended June30, 2006 as identified in Item4 of the Companys Form 10-Q for the period ended September30, 2006, and has concluded that this material weakness in internal control over financial reporting
was remediated in the fourth quarter of 2006. The material weakness related to the Companys incorrect application of GAAP in accounting for the recognition of the gain on sale of ownership interests in Centennial Home Mortgage, LLC at the time
of sale, rather than recording the gain as an indefinite deferral. As part of its remediation plan related to the previously reported
material weakness, during the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company implemented additional control procedures for all unique or complex financial transactions that included ienhanced communication processes between the accounting department
and key operations personnel involved in any such transaction, iipreparation of detailed written documentation regarding the accounting analysis 
80 Table of Contents
and conclusions reached regarding the transaction, including documentation of all accounting principles and guidance considered and outside sources
consulted, and iiiappropriate discussion of the review, analysis and conclusions reached regarding the accounting for such transactions with the Audit Committee. The Company applied these additional control procedures for multiple unique or
complex transactions that arose during the fourth quarter, including ithe liquidation of the Companys interest rate swap agreements, iithe restructuring of the Companys existing credit facility and issuance of detachable
warrants in connection therewith, and iiithe Companys establishment of a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets and, as a result, has determined through the operation and testing of these remediated controls that they were
effective at December31,2006. Management has concluded that the actions taken above have remediated the previously reported material
weakness in the Companys internal control over financial reporting.  Item9B.
