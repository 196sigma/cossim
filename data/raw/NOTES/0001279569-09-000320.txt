REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Vitran
Corporation Inc.
We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vitran Corporation
Inc. the Company as of December31, 2008 and 2007, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2008.Our audit also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index under PartIV,
a2.These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company management.Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public

Statement 159 was adopted January 1, 2008, as required by the
statement.The requirements of SFAS Statement 159 did not have an
effect on the Company consolidated financial statements.

Significant
accounting policies continued:
c
New
accounting pronouncements
continued:
SFAS
Statement 157, Fair Value Measurements, defines fair values, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and requires enhanced disclosures
about fair value measurements.This statement applies when other
accounting pronouncements require or permit fair value
measurements.SFAS Statement 157 was adopted on January 1, 2008 as
required by the statement as described in note11.
SFAS
Statement 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, requires enhanced

financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed
and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; ii recognizes and measures
the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain
purchase; and iii determines what information to disclose to enable users of
the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the
business combination.SFAS Statement 141R applies prospectively to
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1,
2009.Statement 141R will be adopted for any business acquisitions
after January 1, 2009, as required by the statement.
d
Foreign
currency translation:
A
majority of the Company shareholders, customers and industry analysts are
located in the United States.Accordingly, the Company has adopted
the United States dollar as its reporting currency.
The
United States dollar is the functional currency of the Company operations in
the United States.The Canadian dollar is the functional currency of
the Company Canadian operations.
Each
operation translates foreign currency-denominated transactions into its
functional currency using the rate of exchange in effect at the date of the
transaction.
35
1.
Significant
accounting policies continued:
d
Foreign
currency translation continued:
Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into the
functional currency of the operation using the year-end rate of exchange giving
rise to a gain or loss that is recognized in income during the current
period.
For
reporting purposes, the Canadian operations are translated into United States
dollars using the current rate method.Under this method, all assets
and liabilities are translated at the year-end rate of exchange and all revenue
and expense items are translated at the average rate of exchange for the
year.The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a separate
component of shareholders' equity.United States dollar debt of $811
million 2007 - $722 million is designated as a hedge of the investment in the
United States dollar functional operation, such that related transaction gains
and losses are recorded in the separate component of shareholders'
equity.
In
respect of other transactions denominated in currencies other than the Canadian
dollar, the monetary assets and liabilities of the Company are translated at the
year-end rates.Revenue and expenses are translated at rates of
exchange prevailing on the transaction dates.All of the exchange
gains or losses resulting from these other transactions are recognized in
income.
e
Revenue
recognition:
The
Company LTL and truckload business units and freight brokerage operations
recognize revenue upon the delivery of the related freight and direct shipment
costs as incurred.Revenue for the logistics operations is recognized
as the management services are provided.
Within
the LTL business unit, revenue adjustments are estimated at the end of each
quarterly reporting period.These adjustments result from several
factors, including weight and freight classification verifications, shipper bill
of lading errors, pricing discounts and other miscellaneous revenue
adjustments.The revenue adjustments are recorded as a reduction in
revenue from operations and accrued for as part of the allowance for doubtful
accounts.Allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as a
contra-account to Accounts Receivable.
Historical
experience, trends and current information are used to update and evaluate the
estimate.As at December 31, 2008 revenue adjustments as a percentage
of revenue was not material.
f
Accounts
receivable:
Accounts
receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts of
$38million at December 31, 2008 2007 - $25 million.
36
g
Cash
and cash equivalents:
Cash
and cash equivalents include cash on account and short-term investments with
maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and are stated at
cost, which approximates market value.
h
Inventory:
Inventory
consists of tires and spare parts and is valued at the lower of average cost and
replacement cost.
i
Property
and equipment:
Property
and equipment are recorded at cost.Depreciation of property and
equipment is provided on a straight-line basis from the date assets are put in
service over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Buildings
30
- 315 years
Leasehold
interests and improvements
Over
term of lease
Vehicles:
Trailers and
containers
12
years
Trucks
8
years
Machinery
and equipment
5
- 10 years
Tires
purchased as part of a vehicle are capitalized as a cost to the
vehicle.Replacement tires are expensed when placed in
service.
j
Assets
held for sale:
The
Company has certain assets that are classified as assets held for
sale.These assets are carried on the balance sheet at the lower of
the carrying amount or estimated fair value, less cost to sell.Once
an asset is classified held for sale, there is no further depreciation taken on
the asset.At December 31, 2008, the net book value of assets held
for sale was approximately $46 million.This amount is included in
property and equipment on the balance sheet.
k
Goodwill
and intangible assets:
SFAS
statement 142 requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed
for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently if indicators of
impairment exist, using fair value measurement techniques.The
goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units
goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to measure the amount of
impairment loss, if any.The implied fair value of
goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business
combination.Determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is
judgemental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and
assumptions.As at September 30, 2008, the Company completed its
annual goodwill impairment test and concluded there was no
impairment.
37
1.
Significant
accounting policies continued:
One
of the indicators of impairment is a sustained decline in the Companys share
price whereby the market capitalization of the Company is less than its book
value for an extended period of time.At December 31, 2008, before
recording goodwill impairment charges, the carrying value of Vitrans net assets
were $1871 million compared to the market capitalization of all of the
Companys outstanding shares which was $845 million.The market
valuation of the Company declined during the fourth quarter as Vitrans share
price on the Nasdaq stock market decreased from $1347 at September 30, 2008 to
$626 at December 31, 2008. These factors and the depressed macroeconomic
environment indicated a triggering event had occurred requiring the Company, at
a reporting unit level, to test for the impairment of goodwill at December 31,
2008.Using the income and market approach for estimating the fair
value of each reporting unit, management concluded that the goodwill in its LTL
segment was impaired and there was no impairment of goodwill in its other
reporting units.
SFAS
Statement 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs
used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 1 measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3
measurement.The fair value used to value the Companys
goodwill is a Level 3.
Under
SFAS Statement 142 the determination of the amount of goodwill impairment
requires comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting units
goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. The impairment analysis
concluded that the LTL segments goodwill was impaired requiring a pre-tax
non-cash charge of $1074 million.
Intangible
assets consist of not-to-compete covenants and customer relationships and are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected lives ranging from
threeto eight years.
l
Income
taxes:
The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income
taxes.Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the deferred tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases.Significant judgment
is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full
or in part.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled.The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the year that includes the date
of enactment.FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes FIN 48 requires that uncertain tax positions are evaluated
in a two-step process, whereby i the Company determines whether it is more
likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical
merits of the position and ii for those tax positions that meet the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company would recognize the
largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being
realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax
authority.

Share-based
compensation:
Under
the Company stock option plan, options to purchase common shares of the
Company may be granted to key employees, officers and directors of the Company
by the Board of Directors or by the Company Compensation
Committee.There are 856,200 options outstanding under the
plan.The term of each option is 10years and the vesting period
is five years.The exercise price for options is the trading price of
the common shares of the Company on The Toronto Stock Exchange on the day of the
grant.
On
January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payments, using
the modified prospective transition method.In accordance with the
modified prospective transition method, the consolidated financial statements
have not been restated to reflect the impact of SFAS 123R.
Under
SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective method, compensation expense is
recognized for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as
of, January 1, 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance
with the original provisions of SFAS 123 and compensation expense is recognized
for all share-based payments granted on or after January 1, 2006, based on the
grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS123R.
The
Company recorded an income of $01 million related to the cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle as of January 1, 2006.In accordance
with SFAS123, the Company recognized compensation expense assuming all
awards will vest and reversed recognized compensation expense for forfeited
awards only when the awards were actually forfeited.SFAS 123R
requires an estimate of forfeitures when recognizing share-based compensation
expense.Note9b provides supplemental disclosure for the
Company stock options.

Advertising
costs:
Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred.Advertising costs amounted to $462 in
2008 2007 - $784; 2006 - $595.
o
Impairment
of long-lived assets:
An
impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be
held and used exceeds the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected from its use
and disposal, and is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of an
asset exceeds its fair value.A long-lived asset should be tested
when events or circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be
recoverable.During 2008 and 2007, the Company has not identified any
indicators that would require testing for an impairment.

p
Derivative
instruments:
Derivative
instruments are used to hedge the Company exposure to changes in interest
rates.All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices and are recorded in either
current or non-current assets or liabilities based on their
maturity.Changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded in
income or other comprehensive income, based on whether the instrument is
designated as a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge
transaction.Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in
other comprehensive income are reclassified to income in the period the hedged
item affects income.If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to
exist, any associated amounts reported in other comprehensive income are
reclassified into income at that time.Any ineffectiveness is
recognized in income in the current period.
q
Claims
and insurance accruals:
Claims
and insurance accruals reflect the estimated total cost of claims, including
amounts for claims incurred but not reported, for cargo loss and damage, bodily
injury and property damage, workers' compensation, long-term disability and
group health.In Canada and the United States, the Company has
self-insurance retention amounts per incident for auto liability, casualty and
cargo claims.In the United States, the Company has self-insurance
retention amounts per incident for workers' compensation and employee
medical.In establishing these accruals, management evaluates and
monitors each claim individually, and uses factors such as historical
experience, known trends and third party estimates to determine the appropriate
reserves for potential liability.

Deferred
share units:
The
Company maintains a deferred share unit DSU plan for all
directors.Under this plan, all directors receive units at the end of
each quarter based on the market price of common shares equivalent to Cdn.
$2,50000.The Company records compensation expense and the
corresponding liability each period initially for Cdn. $2,50000 and
subsequently based on changes in the market price of common shares.
In
addition to the directors' DSU plan, the Company adopted a DSU plan for senior
executives.Under this plan, eligible senior executives receive units
at the end of each quarter based on the market price of common shares equivalent
to the senior executive entitlement.The entitlement amount varies
based on the senior executive position in the Company and the years of
eligible service.The maximum entitlement amount varies between
$2,50000 and $20,00000 per annum. The Company records compensation expense and
the corresponding liability each period based on the market price of common
shares.
t
Use
of estimates:
The
preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
year.Significant estimates are used in determining, but not limited
to, the allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred tax assets, claims and
insurance accruals, share-based compensation, fair value measurements,
intangible asset values and the fair value of reporting units for purposes of
goodwill impairment tests.Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

At
December 31, 2008, the Company had approximately $431 million of net operating
loss carryforwards available to reduce future years' taxable income for which a
deferred tax asset has been recognized.The net operating loss was
generated in 2007 and 2008 and will expire in 2027 and 2028, respectively, if
not utilized.
The
Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007.At
December 31, 2008, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately
$16 million, of which an estimated $14 million if recognized would have an
impact on the effective tax rate.
The
Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits
in the tax provision.The Company had approximately $03 million
accrued for interest and penalties.
The
Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in U.S. and Canadian
federal jurisdictions, and various states, provinces and foreign
jurisdictions.The Internal Revenue Service and Canada Revenue Agency
had in 2007 commenced examinations of the 2003, 2004 and 2005 income tax
returns.The Internal Revenue Service has since completed its
examination of the 2004 and 2005 tax years.The Canada Revenue Agency
has also completed its examination of the 2003 and 2004 tax years; however, it
has commenced examination of the 2006 and 2007 tax years.The
examinations are expected to be completed by 2009.These audits may
impact the Company unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months; however,
the estimated financial outcome is indeterminable at this
time.Overall, the years 2005 to 2007 remain open to examination by
tax authorities.

Risk
management activities:
The
Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing variable
rate debt.The Company has entered into variable-to-fixed interest
rate swaps on variable rate term debt and revolving debt.The swaps
are accounted for as cash flow hedges.The effective portions of
changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income and are recognized into earnings in the same period
in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects
earnings.Ineffective portions of changes in fair value are
recognized into earnings as they occur.At December 31, 2008, the
notional amount of the swaps was $649 million, with the average pay rate being
459% and the average receive rate being 172%.The swaps mature at
various dates up to December 31, 2011.

Risk
management activities continued:
Effective
January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS Statement 157, which provides a
framework for measuring fair value under GAAP.As defined in SFAS
Statement157, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date exit price.The Company
utilizes market data or assumptions that the Company believes market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions
about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation
technique.These inputs can be readily observable, market
corroborated or generally unobservable.
The
Company primarily applies the income approach for recurring fair value
measurements and endeavours to utilize the best available
information.Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques
that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs.The Company is able to classify fair value balances based on
the observability of those inputs.
SFAS
Statement 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs
used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 1 measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3
measurement.
Assets
and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include the
following as of December 31, 2008:
