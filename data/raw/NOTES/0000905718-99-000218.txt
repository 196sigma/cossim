Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows For The

Notes to Consolidated Financial            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To Consolidated Delivery & Logistics, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Consolidated
Delivery & Logistics, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1998. These consolidated financial statements and
the schedule referred to below are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Consolidated
Delivery & Logistics, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.
Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in the index to
financial statement schedules is the responsibility of the Company management
and is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and is not part of the basic financial statements. This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.                ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP Roseland, New Jersey

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1   ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS Consolidated Delivery & Logistics, Inc. was founded in June 1994. In November
1995, simultaneously with the closing of the it initial public offering the
Offering separate wholly owned subsidiaries of Consolidated Delivery &
Logistics, Inc. merged the Merger with each of the eleven acquired
businesses. Consideration for the acquisition of these businesses consisted of a
combination of cash and common stock of Consolidated Delivery & Logistics, Inc.,
par value $0001 per share. The assets and liabilities of the acquired
businesses at September 30, 1995 were recorded at their historical amounts.
Consolidated Delivery & Logistics, Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company or
CDL provides an extensive network of same-day ground and air delivery
services to a wide range of commercial, industrial and retail customers. CDL
ground delivery operations currently are concentrated on the East Coast, with a
strategic presence in the Midwest and on the West Coast. CDL air delivery
services are provided throughout the United States and to major cities around
the world.
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates in Preparation of the Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents CDL considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost,
which approximates market value. Included in cash and cash equivalents is cash
restricted for a national marketing and advertising program for CDL sales
agency agreements see Note 13.
Equipment and Leasehold Improvements Equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost. Depreciation is
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Leasehold improvements and assets subject to capital leases are
amortized over the shorter of the terms of the leases or lives of the assets.
Deferred Financing Costs The costs incurred for obtaining financing, including all related legal and
accounting fees are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets and are amortized over the life of the related financing from two
to four years. Intangible Assets Intangible  assets consist of goodwill,  customer lists, and non-compete
agreements. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of assets of businesses acquired and is amortized on a straight-line basis
over twenty-five years to forty years. Customer lists and non-compete agreements
are amortized over the estimated period to be benefited, generally from three to
five years.
Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when the shipment is completed, or when services are
rendered to customers, and expenses are recognized as incurred. Certain
customers pay in advance, giving rise to deferred revenue.
Income Taxes CDL accounts for income taxes utilizing the liability approach. Deferred income
taxes are provided for differences in the recognition of assets and liabilities
for tax and financial reporting purposes. Temporary differences result primarily
from accelerated depreciation and amortization for tax purposes, various
accruals and reserves being deductible for tax purposes in future periods and
certain acquired businesses reporting on the cash basis for income tax purposes
prior to the Merger.
Long-Lived Assets CDL reviews its long-lived assets and certain related intangibles for impairment
whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be fully recoverable. The measurement of impairment losses to be
recognized is based on the difference between the fair values and the carrying
amounts of the assets. Impairment would be recognized in operating results if a
diminution in value occurred. The Company does not believe that any such changes
have occurred.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments Due to the short maturities of CDL cash, receivables and payables, the
carrying value of these financial instruments approximates their fair values.
The fair value of CDL debt is estimated based on the current rates offered to
CDL for debt with similar remaining maturities. CDL believes that the carrying
value of its debt estimates the fair value of such debt instruments.
Stock Based Compensation Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS 123 requires that an entity account for employee stock
compensation under a fair value based method. However, SFAS 123 also allows an
entity to continue to measure compensation cost for employee stock-based
compensation plans using the intrinsic value based method of accounting
prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,
Opinion 25. CDL has elected to continue to account for employee stock-based
compensation under Opinion 25 and provide the required pro forma disclosures as
if the fair value based method of accounting under SFAS 123 had been applied
see Note 14. Income Loss Per Share CDL follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per
Share to calculate its earnings per share EPS. Basic earnings per share
represents net income loss divided by the weighted average shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share represents net income loss divided by weighted
average shares outstanding adjusted for the incremental dilution of common stock
equivalents.
A reconciliation of weighted average common shares outstanding to weighted
average common shares outstanding assuming dilution follows                            1998        1997         1996

Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 98-1,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use. The statement is intended to eliminate the diversity in practice
in accounting for internal-use software costs and improve financial reporting.
The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998.
The Company has determined that the effect of this statement on the Company
consolidated financial position and results of operations is immaterial. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years' consolidated
financial statements in order to conform to the 1998 presentation.
3   BUSINESS COMBINATIONS In July 1998, the Company acquired all of the assets and certain liabilities of
Metro Courier Network, Inc. Metro, a provider of ground delivery services in
Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire. The purchase price was approximately
$44 million, consisting of $26 million in cash and a $18 million convertible
note the Note plus certain contingent payments. The excess purchase price
over fair value of the underlying assets of $44 million was allocated to
goodwill and other intangible assets. The Note bears interest at the rate of 7%
per annum, with interest payable quarterly, is due July 2001 and is subordinate
to all indebtedness due or that may become due to the Company senior lender,
First Union Commercial Corporation or its affiliates. The Note is convertible in
its entirety at the option of the holder at any time through July 1, 2001 into
fully paid shares of the Company common stock at a conversion price of $7 per
share over a ninety-day period. In addition, the purchase agreement also
provided for a contingent earn-out of up to $15 million which has been amended
by an agreement dated January 7, 1999, which cancelled this contingent
obligation. The agreement required a purchase price adjustment of $180,000 which
will result in an adjustment to increase the excess of purchase price over fair
value of the net assets for this amount.
In August 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of the
capital stock of KBD Services, Inc. KBD, a provider of ground delivery
services in North and South Carolina. The purchase price was approximately $41
million consisting of $21 million in cash, a $15 million 7% subordinated
convertible note the KBD Note and a $500,000, 7% contingent subordinated
convertible note the Contingent Note. The excess purchase price over fair
value of the underlying assets of $35 million was allocated to goodwill. The
KBD Note is due August 5, 2003 with interest payable quarterly commencing
October 1, 1998 and is convertible in its entirety at the option of the holder
at any time through July 1, 2003 into fully paid shares of the Company common
stock if the market price equals or exceeds $6 per share over a thirty day
period. The Contingent Note is subject to reduction or discharge if KBD
earnings before interest and taxes are less than $700,000 for the year ending
July 31, 1999 and is due with interest on the finally determined principal on
November 1, 1999. The holder or the Company may convert the Contingent Note in
its entirety into fully paid shares of the Company common stock at a
conversion price of $6 per share after September 16, 1999 and through October
20, 1999. The KBD Note and the Contingent Note are subordinate to all
indebtedness due or that may become due to the Company senior lender, First
Union Commercial Corporation or its affiliates.
In September 1998, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain
liabilities of Eveready Express Corp. Eveready, a provider of ground
delivery services in the New York City market. The purchase price for the assets
and certain non-compete agreements was $975,000, with $415,000 in cash and a
$560,000 subordinated contingent note the Eveready Contingent Note. The
entire purchase price was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. The
Eveready Contingent Note bears interest at the rate of 6% per annum, with semi-annual principal payments of $50,000 plus accrued interest commencing March
1999 and the remaining balance of principal and interest due September 2000. The
final determination of the purchase price and the Eveready Contingent Note will
be based upon the percentage of collected revenues earned by Eveready during the
one-year period following the closing.  The Eveready Contingent Note is
subordinate to all indebtedness due or that may become due to the Company
senior lender, First Union Commercial Corporation or its affiliates.
In December 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of the
capital stock of First Choice Courier and Distribution Systems, Inc., Regional
Express II, Inc., Regional Express III, Inc., and Manteca Enterprises, Inc.
collectively First Choice Companies. The purchase price was approximately
$50 million consisting of $29 million in cash including direct acquisition
costs, 206,185 shares of the Company common stock at $3438 per share and
$14 million in 7% subordinated convertible notes the Notes. The excess
purchase price over fair value of the underlying assets of $50 million was
allocated to goodwill. The Notes are due December 8, 2001 with interest payable
quarterly commencing February 28, 1999. At the option of either the holder or
CDL, under certain circumstances 50% of the principal amount of the Notes are
convertible into fully paid shares of CDL common stock at a conversion price of
$7 per share. The notes are subordinate to all existing or future senior debt of
CDL. In addition, a contingent earn-out in the aggregate amount of up to
$800,000 is payable based on the achievement of certain financial goals during
the three-year period following the closing.
Any payments of the earnouts discussed above will increase the goodwill recorded
for the acquisition of the applicable company. The amortization of any
additional goodwill and the conversion of any of the convertible notes and
contingent convertible notes payable into common stock will negatively affect
the Company future earnings per share.
The above transactions have been accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting. Accordingly, the allocation of the cost of the acquired assets and
liabilities has been made on the basis of the estimated fair value. The
consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business
from their respective dates of acquisition.
The following summarized  unaudited pro forma financial  information in
thousands, except per share data assumes that the Metro, KBD and First Choice
acquisitions were consummated on January 1, 1998 and 1997. This information is
not necessarily indicative of the results the Company would have obtained had
these events actually occurred on such dates or of the Company actual or
future results.                              For the Year         For the Year

Diluted net income per share                $33             $16 During 1996, the Company acquired certain businesses in transactions accounted
for as purchases. The total consideration paid in these transactions is
contingent upon future activity and is estimated to aggregate $33 million,
which consists of $22 million in cash, 75,312 shares of Common Stock at $8 per
share and 90,909 shares of Common Stock at $550 per share. The Company also
assumed approximately $185,000 of debt due to the former owners of one of the
acquired businesses and their relatives. Of this amount $31 million has been
assigned to the excess of purchase price over net assets of businesses acquired
goodwill and other intangible assets. The purchase price was subsequently
reduced by  approximately  $259,000  and $357,000  during 1998 and 1997,
respectively, due to actual revenue not reaching projected revenue as stipulated
in the purchase agreements. Accordingly, goodwill and seller-financed debt were
reduced by this amount to reflect the reduction in the purchase price. Final
determinations of the individual acquisition costs will be made by April 2000.
The results of the acquired businesses have been reflected in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations since their respective acquisition dates.
The results of operations of the acquired businesses prior to their acquisitions
are not material to the Company consolidated statements of operations.
4   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On December 31, 1997, the Company entered into an agreement providing for the
sale of certain assets of its fulfillment and direct mail business. The purchase
price for the assets was $850,000 and is comprised of $125,000 in cash with the
remainder in the form of a promissory note the Note Receivable. The Note
Receivable bears interest at the rate of 6% per annum, with interest only in
monthly installments during 1998.  Commencing February 1, 1999 the Note
Receivable will be paid in equal monthly installments of $14,016 including
principal and interest through January 1, 2004. The Note Receivable is included
in prepaid expenses and other current assets $117,000 at December 31, 1998 and
in security deposits and other assets $608,000 and $725,000 at December 31,
1998 and 1997, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
The Note Receivable is collateralized by a security interest in the purchaser
accounts receivable, equipment and general intangibles. The security interest is
subordinate to the interest of the purchaser majority shareholder.
Accordingly, the financial position, operating results and the gain on the
disposition of the Company direct mail business have been segregated from continuing operations and reclassified as a discontinued
operation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

borrowings on such lines of credit were approximately $136 million at December
31, 1998 and $74 million at December 31, 1997.
In November 1998, CDL and First Union Commercial Corporation First Union
modified an agreement entered into in July 1997, establishing a revolving credit
facility the First Union Agreement. The First Union Agreement provides for
an increase in the original credit facility from $15 million to $225 million,
provides CDL with an equipment acquisition term loan facility of up to $25
million and modifies other terms and conditions. Credit availability is based on
eligible amounts of accounts receivable, as defined, up to a maximum amount of
$225 million and is secured by substantially all of the assets, including
certain cash balances, accounts receivable, equipment and leasehold improvements
and general intangibles of the Company and its subsidiaries. The First Union
Agreement provides for both fixed and variable rate loans. Interest rates on
fixed rate borrowings are based on LIBOR which was 507% at December 31, 1998,
plus 15% to 2%. Variable rate borrowings are based on First Union prime
lending rate which was 775% at December 31, 1998, minus 25% to plus 25%.
Based on eligible accounts receivable at December 31, 1998, $25 million of the
credit facility and $25 million of the equipment acquisition term loan facility
were available for future borrowings. Under the terms of the First Union Agreement, the Company is required to
maintain certain financial ratios and comply with other financial conditions.
The First Union Agreement also prohibits the Company from incurring certain
additional indebtedness, limits certain investments, advances or loans and
restricts substantial asset sales, capital expenditures and cash dividends. At
December 31, 1998, the Company was in compliance with all loan covenants.
Borrowings under the line of credit facility averaged approximately $78 million
with an average interest rate of 91% for the year ended December 31, 1998.
Maximum borrowings were $136 million for the same period.

12   REPORTABLE SEGMENTS Effective December 31, 1998, CDL implemented Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information, SFAS 131. SFAS 131 requires a company to disclose reportable
segments based on the way management organizes its segments for making operating
decisions and assessing performance. CDL has two reportable segments: Air and
Ground. Separate management of each segment is required because each business
unit is subject to different cost and delivery parameters. Segment information
for 1998, 1997 and 1996 is as follows in thousands.                                Air      Ground      Total

freight, next flight out and international shipments whereby package movement is
by air generally on scheduled airline flights. CDL ground delivery services are
provided to customers by a CDL driver in a vehicle either on a rush basis or on
a regularly scheduled route basis. Air revenue is generally measured by package
while ground delivery revenue is generally measured by the number of stops
involved.
Intersegment revenue results from the provision of ground service for the
pick-up or delivery of packages for delivery to airports or from airports to
customers. The Air Division also provides delivery by air of time-critical
material for ultimate distribution by ground-based drivers.
Management evaluates the performance of each segment based on its overall
contribution to the Company net income after factoring in the allocation of
interest as well as an intersegment  charge for Corporate  general and
administrative expenses. 13   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Operating Leases The Company leases its office and warehouse facilities under noncancellable
operating leases, which expire at various times through January 2007. The approximate minimum rental commitments of the Company, under existing agreements
as of December 31, 1998, are as follows in thousands      1999                          $4,274
2000                           3,323
2001                           2,427

2003                            955
Thereafter                        1,488 Rent expense related to operating leases amounted to approximately $127
million, $131 million and $137 million for the years ended December 31, 1998,
1997 and 1996, respectively.
Litigation In February 1996, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company Liberty Mutual filed an
action against Securities Courier Corporation Securities, a subsidiary of
the Company, Mr. Vincent Brana and certain other parties in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging, among other
things, that Securities Courier had fraudulently obtained automobile liability
insurance from Liberty Mutual in the late 1980s and early 1990s at below market
rates. This suit, which claims common law fraud, fraudulent inducement, unjust
enrichment and violations of the civil provisions of the Federal RICO statute,
among other things, seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive
damages from the defendants, as well as attorneys' fees and other expenses.
Under the terms of its acquisition of Securities, the Company has certain rights
to indemnification from Mr. Brana. In connection with the indemnification, Mr.
Brana has entered into a Settlement Agreement and executed a Promissory Note in
the amount of up to $500,000 or such greater amount as may be due together with
interest calculated at a rate equivalent to the rate charged the Company by its
senior lender and due on December 1, 2000. The Promissory Note is further
secured by 100,000 shares of CDL common stock. Discovery is currently pending
and as a result the Company is unable to make a determination as to the merits
of the claim. The Company does not believe that an adverse determination in this
matter would result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
position or results of operations of the Company.
The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time, parties to litigation
arising in the normal course of their business, most of which involves claims
for personal injury and property damage incurred in connection with their
operations. Management believes that none of these actions, including the above
action, will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results
of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Sales Agency Agreements The Company has entered into sales agency  agreements with  independent
contractors with varying terms to perform courier services on behalf of the
Company. The independent contractors provide marketing and sales services and the Company provides the resources to perform courier services. In connection
with these transactions the Company retains from the independent contractors a
fee for services rendered of approximately 10% of revenues. The profit on these
sales net of the Company fees for its services is remitted back to the
independent contractors as payment for marketing and sales services rendered.
Sales agency charges totaled $42 million, $47 million and $38 million in
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
Earn-Outs Certain of the companies acquired by CDL are eligible to earn additional
amounts, consisting of a combination of cash and notes payable, as adjustments
to the purchase prices paid for those companies. At December 31, 1998, the
Company recorded an accrual for the estimated earn-outs for KBD $500,000
contingent note payable, Everready $560,000 contingent note payable, and the
First Choice Companies $687,000 payable in cash and included in other
liabilities in the accompanying financial statements.
14   STOCK OPTION PLANS The Company has two stock option plans under which employees and independent
directors may be granted options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock at
or above the fair market value at the date of grant. Options generally vest in
one to four years and expire in 10 years.
Employee Stock compensation Program In September 1995, the Board of Directors adopted, and the stockholders of the
Company approved the Company Employee Stock Compensation  Program the
Employee Stock Compensation Program. The Employee Stock Compensation Program
authorizes the granting of incentive stock options, non-qualified supplementary
options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and stock bonus awards to
key employees of the Company, including those employees serving as officers or
directors of the Company. The Company initially reserved 1,400,000 shares of
Common Stock for issuance in connection with the Employee Stock Compensation
Program. In June 1998, the Board of Directors adopted and the stockholders of
the Company approved an additional 500,000 shares for issuance under the
Employee Stock Compensation Program. The Employee Stock Compensation Program is
administered by a committee of the Board of Directors the Administrators
made up of directors who are disinterested persons. Options and awards granted
under the Employee Stock Compensation Program will have an exercise or payment
price as established by the Administrators provided that the exercise price of
incentive stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Unless otherwise specified by the
Administrators, options and awards will vest in four equal installments on the
first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant.
1995 Stock Option Plan for Independent Directors In September 1995, the Board of Directors adopted, and the stockholders of the
Company approved, the Company 1995 Stock Option Plan for Independent Directors
the  Director  Plan.  The Director Plan  authorizes the granting of
non-qualified stock options to non-employee directors of the Company. The
Company has reserved 100,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance in connection
with the Director Plan. The Director Plan is administered by a committee of the
Board of Directors the Committee, none of whom will be eligible to
participate in the Director Plan. The Director Plan provided for an initial
grant of an option to purchase 1,500 shares of Common Stock upon election as a
director of the Company, a second option to purchase 1,000 shares of Common
Stock upon the one-year anniversary of such director election and subsequent
annual options for 500 shares of Common Stock upon the anniversary of each year
of service as a director. In June 1998, the stockholders of the Company approved
amendments to the Director Plan. The amendments replaced the annual stock option
grants of the original plan with quarterly grants of 1,250 shares of stock
options on the first trading day of each fiscal quarter commencing on October 1,
1997. In August 1998 and February 1999, the committee approved further
amendments to the Plan. These amendments, subject to shareholder approval at the
annual meeting, replaced the time period to exercise vested options after a
participating director has served as a director for a period of three
consecutive years or more. The Director Plan was amended to provide that in the
event any holder, who has served as a director for three or more consecutive
years, shall cease to be a director for any reason, including removal with or
without cause or death or disability, all options to the extent exercisable at
the termination of the director service shall remain exercisable by the
holder or his lawful heirs, executors or administrators until the expiration of
the ten-year period following the date such options were granted. Information regarding the Company stock option plans is summarized below                                     Weighted

- -               The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123 and has chosen to continue to
account for stock-based  compensation  using the intrinsic value method.
Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for its stock-based
compensation plans. Pro forma information regarding net income loss and
earnings loss per share is required and has been determined as if the Company
had accounted for its stock options under the fair value method. The fair value
for these options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following assumptions for 1998, 1997 and 1996                                       1998        1997        1996

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value
estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options
is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The Company pro
