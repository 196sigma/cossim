REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Tumbleweed Communications Corp.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tumbleweed
Communications Corp. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2000.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tumbleweed
Communications Corp. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1 ORGANIZATION
Tumbleweed Communications Corp. Tumbleweed or the Company, a Delaware
corporation initially incorporated in California in June 1993, is a leading
provider of mission-critical messaging solutions that enable organizations to
manage and secure online business communications and processes. Customers may
use Tumbleweed solutions to centrally control and monitor the corporate
communications stream to comply with policies and government regulations,
communicate securely with business partners, suppliers, and customers, and to

offers a foundation for the automated legacy data extraction, preparation, and
secure two-way communication of sensitive or confidential business information,
such as electronic statements and customer service inquiries. Tumbleweed
solutions are centrally controlled by IT managers while remaining transparent to
end-users who do not need to deploy new software or modify behavior to comply
with corporate security and communications policies.
On August 2, 1999, the Company reincorporated in the state of Delaware. The
Certificate of Incorporation of the Delaware successor corporation authorizes
100 million shares of common stock and 10 million shares of preferred stock at
$0001 par value per share. The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been retroactively restated to give effect to the reincorporation.
The Company maintains its headquarters in Redwood City, California. During
1999, the Company incorporated subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Germany,
France, and Japan. During 2000, the Company incorporated subsidiaries in
Australia, the Netherlands, Sweden, Hong Kong, and Switzerland.
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND CONSOLIDATION POLICY
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries, Worldtalk Communications Corp.
Worldtalk, and Interface Systems, Inc. Interface; the Company wholly
owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom, which includes the United Kingdom
wholly owned subsidiaries in France, Germany, Australia, the Netherlands,
Switzerland, Sweden and Hong Kong; and the Company majority-owned subsidiary
in Japan, Tumbleweed Communications KK TKK. The results of operations for
TKK have been included in the Company consolidated statements of operations
except for the period from September 1, 1999 to March 31, 2000, when it was an
investment accounted for under the equity method. The results of operations for
Interface have been included commencing September 1, 2000, the effective date of
its acquisition.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.
CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with remaining
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
The Company generally has classified its investment securities as
available-for-sale and accounts for them at estimated fair value. Realized and
unrealized gains and losses were not significant for 2000, 1999, and 1998. The
cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
asset, generally 3 to 5 years for computers, furniture, and equipment; 33 years
for buildings and improvements; and the shorter of the estimated useful life of
the asset or the remaining lease term for leasehold improvements. Equipment
under capital lease is amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life
of the asset or the lease term.
OTHER INVESTMENTS
During 2000, the Company made investments in two non-public companies of
$977,000 and $30 million. The investments are accounted for using the cost
method and are included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet as of
December 31, 2000. One of the investee companies provided services to Tumbleweed
in the amount of approximately $542,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000.
GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill and intangible assets relating to purchase business combinations
are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to five
years.
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE
Development costs incurred in the research and development of new software
products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred
until technological feasibility in the form of a working model has been
established. To date, capitalized costs for the Company software development
have not been material.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash equivalents and
accounts receivable. The Company cash equivalents generally consist of money
market funds with qualified financial institutions. To reduce credit risk with
accounts receivable, the Company performs ongoing evaluations of its customers'
financial conditions and maintains allowances for credit losses, when necessary.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position SOP 97-2, SOFTWARE
REVENUE RECOGNITION and SOP 98-9, SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION WITH RESPECT TO
CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS, which generally requires revenue recognized from software
arrangements to be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the
relative fair values of the elements, such as software products, consulting,
training, installation, or post-contract customer support. Fair values are based
upon vendor specific objective evidence. If such evidence of fair value for each
undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist, all revenue from

TUMBLEWEED COMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000, 1999
AND 1998 CONTINUED
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does
exist, or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered.
The Company customer contracts are generally multiple-element
arrangements; that is, they involve the Company providing a combination of
products and services to a customer. Revenue is allocated to the various
elements based on the relative fair values of the elements. Revenue allocated to
the various elements is recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria
are met for that element or group of elements.
License revenue consists of initial license fees and the sale of
distribution rights. License revenue typically is recognized upon shipment of
the software. Revenue from the sale of distribution rights is recognized upon
the execution of a distribution agreement. Service fee revenue consists of
consulting fees and support and maintenance fees. Consulting fees related to
installation are recognized upon acceptance of the installation while all other
consulting fees are recognized based on percentage of completion. Support and
maintenance fees are paid for ongoing customer support as well as for the right
to receive future upgrades to the Company products during the term of the
maintenance agreement. Revenue from support and maintenance is recognized
ratably over the period the support is provided. Transaction fees are based on
the volume of transactions by the Company customers, and the related revenue
is recognized based on payment schedules and transaction reports from the
Company customers. A number of the Company contracts include minimum
transaction volume requirements. In these cases, the minimum guaranteed revenue
is recognized when fees are due and payable during those months where
transaction volume does not exceed the designated minimums.
The Company provides limited warranty rights to its customers, which are
accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 5, ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES. Estimated warranty obligations are
provided by charges to operations in the period in which the related revenue is
recognized. To date, the estimated warranty obligations have not been considered
significant.
ADVERTISING
The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Total advertising
expense was $450,000, $399,000, and $565,000 for 2000, 1999, and 1998,
respectively.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
basis and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax
assets to an amount whose realization is more likely than not. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation arrangements for
employees using the intrinsic-value method pursuant to Accounting Principles
Board Opinion APB No. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES. As such,
compensation expense is recorded for fixed plan stock options on the date of
grant when the fair value of the underlying common stock exceeds the exercise
price for stock options or the purchase price for issuance or sales of common
stock. Expense associated with stock-based compensation is being amortized on an
accelerated basis over the vesting period of the individual award consistent
with the method described in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
Interpretation No. 28. Options granted to consultants and other non-employees
are considered compensatory and are accounted for at fair value pursuant to SFAS
No. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. The Company discloses the pro
forma effects of using the fair value method of accounting for all stock-based
compensation arrangements in accordance with SFAS No. 123.
NET LOSS PER SHARE
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss for the period
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss for the period
by the weighted average number of common and potential common shares outstanding
during the period if their effect is dilutive. The following potential common
shares have been excluded from the determination of diluted net loss per share
for all periods because the effect of such shares would have been anti-dilutive

Company foreign currency translation policy. The tax effects of translation
adjustments were not significant.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The fair value of the Company cash, cash equivalents, marketable
securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and equipment line approximate
their carrying values due to the short maturity or variable-rate structure of
those instruments.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The functional currency for each foreign subsidiary is its respective local
currency. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities related to these operations
are translated at the current exchange rates at the end of each period. The
resulting cumulative translation adjustments are recorded directly to the
accumulated other comprehensive income loss account in stockholders' equity.
Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect during
the period. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in
results of operations. These amounts were not significant in 2000, 1999, and
1998. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, no foreign currency translation exposures
were hedged.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company reviews its long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible
assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets
held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to
future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If
such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
RECLASSIFICATION
Certain reclassifications, none of which affected net income, have been made
to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 establishes methods of
accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related
to those instruments as well as other hedging activities. SFAS No133, as
amended by SFAS No. 137, is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years
beginning after June 15                    50

2000. To date, Tumbleweed has not entered into any derivative financial
instruments or hedging activities.
In December 1999, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101.
The SAB summarized certain of the SEC Staff views in applying generally
accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements.
SAB No. 101, as amended by SAB No. 101B, was adopted by Tumbleweed during the
quarter ended December 31, 2000. There was no material change to the Company
accounting for revenue as a result of the adoption of SAB Nos. 101 and 101B.
In March 2000, FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 44 FIN 44. FIN
44 clarifies a the definition of employee for purposes of applying APB Opinion
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, b the criteria for determining
whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan, c the accounting
consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock
option or award, and d the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation
awards in a business combination. FIN 44 is effective July 1, 2000, but certain
conclusions in this interpretation cover specific events that occur after either
December 15, 1998, or January 12, 2000. To the extent that this interpretation
covers events occurring during the period after December 15, 1998, or
January 12, 2000, but before the effective date of July 1, 2000, the effects of
applying this interpretation are recognized on a prospective basis from July 1,
2000. The application of FIN 44 did not have a material impact on Tumbleweed
financial position or results of operations.
3 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
WORLDTALK COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION
On January 31, 2000, the Company completed its acquisition of Worldtalk.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, each Worldtalk share of common stock
has been converted into 026 of a share of the Company common stock. A total
of 3,798,398 shares of the Company common stock was exchanged for 14,609,374
shares of Worldtalk common stock. The business combination was accounted for as
a pooling of interests and, accordingly, the Company historical financial
statements have been restated to include the accounts and results of operations
of Worldtalk.
INTERFACE SYSTEMS, INC.
On September 1, 2000, Tumbleweed acquired Interface, which developed and
sold software-based tool and solutions to integrate legacy systems with Internet
technology, distribute mainframe documents, and provide host connectivity. The
acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and
accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition
date. Since September 1, 2000, Interface results of operations have been
included in the Company Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value
of the intangible assets was determined based upon a valuation using a
combination of methods, including a cost approach for the assembled workforce,
and an income approach for the core technology.
The purchase price of approximately $771 million consisted of an exchange
of 1,249,210 shares of the Company common stock with a fair value of
approximately $642 million, assumed stock options with a fair value of
approximately $79 million, cash paid of $20 million, and other acquisition
related

In February 1999, the Company issued 3,914,989 shares of Series C preferred
stock at a price of $358 to Hikari Tsushin Hikari, a Japanese company,
resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $140 million. In
August 1999, in connection with the initial public offering, Hikari purchased
400,000 shares of common stock at $1200 per share, resulting in gross proceeds
to the Company of approximately $48 million. As of December 31, 2000 and 1999,
Hikari owned approximately 0% and 20% of the Company outstanding common stock,
respectively.

5 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS CONTINUED
On March 31, 1999, Tumbleweed KK TKK, a wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary
of the Company until August 31, 1999 when it became an equity investee, entered
into a one-year License and Distribution Agreement with Hikari. A summary of the
terms of this agreement is as follows   - TKK granted Hikari a perpetual license to use the Company product in
consideration of a one-time, non-refundable fee of Y30,000,000 which
approximated $251,000 as of March 31, 1999.
- Hikari was granted distribution rights to sell the Company products to
third parties in consideration of a one-time, non-refundable fee of
Y20,000,000 which approximated $167,000 as of March 31, 1999.
- Beginning on April 1, 1999, Hikari began making quarterly, non-refundable
prepaid transaction fees of Y23,625,000 which approximated $231,000 as of
December 31, 1999. The quarterly transaction fees are based on quarterly
minimum volume commitments, and will be recognized as revenue in the
quarter that the amounts are due and payable. The Company recognized
$310,000 and $331,000 in transaction fees from Hikari during 2000 and
1999, respectively.
On July 1, 1999, the Company entered into a Technology License Agreement
with TKK. A summary of the terms of this agreement is as follows   - The Company granted TKK a five year, non-exclusive license to use
Tumbleweed IME products in connection with the marketing and sub-licensing
of Tumbleweed IME products in Japan.
- Beginning on July 1, 1999, and as consideration for the license grant, TKK
is obligated to pay the Company a royalty based on license and transaction
fees revenue achieved by TKK. The royalty rate begins at 60% of TKK net
license revenue in 1999, declining to 55% in 2000 and 50% in 2001 and
thereafter. The Company management believes that these terms approximate
arms-length rates for such sublicensing activities.
- During the term of the agreement, the Company will provide maintenance and
support services to TKK. The Company receives an annual fee of $100,000
for the services.
On August 31, 1999, TKK sold 200 shares of its common stock, representing a
50% ownership interest in TKK, to Hikari for Y350,000,000 which approximated
$32 million as of August 31, 1999. Following Hikari investment, Hikari and
the Company had equal board representation in TKK. As a result of the equity
transaction and the change in board constituency, the Company no longer believed
it had control of TKK. Consequently, beginning September 1, 1999, the Company
began accounting for its investment in TKK on the equity method of accounting
rather than the consolidation method. Because TKK sold shares to Hikari, the
Company share of the book value of TKK net assets exceeded the carrying
amount of the investment by $149 million. As a result the Company recorded

value of the underlying common stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock
options at the date of grant. The Company has recorded deferred compensation
expense of approximately $40 million, $73 million, $17 million, for the
difference at the grant date between the exercise price and the fair value of
the common stock underlying the options granted in the years ended December 31,
2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. These amounts are being amortized on an
accelerated basis over the vesting period, generally four years, consistent with
the method described in FASB Interpretation No. 28. Amortization of deferred
compensation of approximately $54 million, $35 million, and $715,000 was
recognized in the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.
Had compensation cost for the Company stock-based compensation plan been

completed resulting in the issuance of 19,107 shares of the Company common stock
and eliminating the outstanding warrant balance.
In connection with the February 1999 Series C financing, the Company
financial advisor earned the right to receive a warrant to acquire 58,725 shares
of Series C convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of $358. The value
of the warrant was included as an issuance cost of the Series C financing. The
warrant was exercised at the time of the IPO in August 1999.
In connection with the May 1999 Series C financing, the Company issued a
warrant to acquire 16,778 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock at an
exercise price of $358. The value of the warrant was included as an issuance

In July 1999, in exchange for marketing and publicity assistance from a
customer, the Company issued a warrant to acquire 100,000 shares of its common

at an exercise price of $20 per share; 25,000 shares at an exercise price of $30
per share; and 25,000 shares at an exercise price of $40 per share. Using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model, the total fair value of the warrant was
estimated to be $127,000, based on the following assumptions: no dividends;
contractual term of three years; risk-free interest rate of 48%; and expected
volatility of 60%. The fair value of the warrant was charged to sales and
marketing expense in the third quarter of 1999. In June 1999, the Company
entered into a license agreement and a consulting agreement with the customer
for approximately $355,000 in aggregate. The first tranch of 50,000 shares for

RESTRUCTURING
In January 2001, the Board of Directors approved a restructuring program.
This restructuring program focuses the Company efforts towards concentrating
on its strongest opportunities, reducing operating expenses, and improving the
Company allocation of resources. This involved closing international locations
in Paris, France; Chatsworth, Australia; and Stockholm Sweden. The restructuring
program also realigned the professional services organization, and included a
targeted staff reduction of approximately 20%. Total charges incurred as a
result of the restructuring are anticipated to be approximately $9-10 million in
the first quarter of 2001, which includes severance and related charges
associated with the reduction in force and charges related to vacating leased
facilities domestically and abroad.
In addition to the restructuring, the Company announced its intent to revise
its pricing model to include upgrades as part of the license and transaction
bundles, resulting in ratable revenue recognition over the term of the license
agreement.
On March 4, 2001, the Board of Directors unanimously approved an amendment
to the 2000 NSO Incentive Stock Plan to increase the number of shares of common
stock reserved for issuance under the plan from 1,181,000 to 4,181,000.
