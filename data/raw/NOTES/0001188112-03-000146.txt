Schedule II - Valuation and Qualifying     42                    25 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Aware, Inc. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Aware,
Inc. and its subsidiary at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction
with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements
and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted
our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.  NATURE OF BUSINESS
We are a leader in the development and marketing of intellectual property
for broadband communications. Our principal offering to date has been
Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line ADSL technology for the
telecommunications industry. ADSL enables telephone companies to use their
existing copper telephone lines to offer broadband services. We have
adopted an intellectual property business model in which we neither
manufacture nor sell integrated circuits incorporating our technology. We
license our broadband technology on a nonexclusive and worldwide basis to
semiconductor companies that manufacture and sell products that incorporate
our technology. Our licensees sell integrated circuits to equipment
companies who incorporate those integrated circuits into their products. We
also offer ADSL hardware products and image compression software products. 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION - The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Aware, Inc. and its subsidiary. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of
demand deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, and discount notes
in highly liquid short-term instruments with original maturities of three
months or less from the date of purchase and are stated at cost, which
approximates market.
INVESTMENTS - At December 31, 2002 and 2001, we categorized all securities
as available-for-sale, since we may liquidate these investments
currently. In calculating realized gains and losses, cost is determined
using specific identification. Unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported in a
separate component of stockholders' equity. At December 31, 2002 and 2001,
unrealized gains and losses were not material.
The amortized cost of securities, which approximates fair value, consists
of the following at December 31, 2002 and 2001 in thousands     Short-term Investments           2002       2001

U.S. agency securities.     12,786        -
$13,816        -
ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS - Accounts are charged to the allowance for
doubtful accounts as they are deemed uncollectible based on a periodic
review of the accounts. Bad debt expense was $707,000, $25,000, and
$325,000 for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.
INVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with
cost being determined by the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
31                  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT - Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is provided using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Upon retirement or sale, the costs of the assets disposed of and the
related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any
resulting gain or loss is included in the determination of income or loss.
The estimated useful lives of assets used by us are     Building and    30 years
Furniture and fixtures and office equipment.    5 years
Computer & manufacturing equipment.    3 years
Purchased     3 years   IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS - We review long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that
the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. Each impairment
test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the
recorded value of the asset. If an impairment is indicated, the asset is
written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis.
The cash flow estimates used to determine the impairment, if any, reflect
our best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at that
time. We believe that no significant impairment of our long-lived assets
has occurred as of December 31, 2002.
REVENUE RECOGNITION. Effective January 1, 2000, we adopted Securities and
Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition
in Financial Statements SAB 101. Accordingly, our general revenue
recognition policy is to recognize revenue when there is persuasive
evidence of an arrangement, the sales price is fixed or determinable,
collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured, and delivery
has occurred or services have been rendered.
We derive our revenue from three sources i product revenue, which
includes revenue from the sale of ADSL equipment products and compression
software products, ii contract revenue, which includes license and
engineering service fees that we receive under customer agreements, and
iii royalties that we receive under customer contracts. In addition to
the general revenue recognition principles prescribed by SAB 101, our
specific revenue recognition policies for each revenue source are more
fully described below.
PRODUCT SALES. Product sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of:
i hardware products, and ii compression software.
o  Hardware products, including ADSL transceiver modules and test
and development systems are standalone products that are sold
independently of our technology licensing business. The terms of
sales generally do not contain provisions that obligate us to
provide additional products or services after shipment.
Additionally, we do not grant return rights other than normal
warranty rights of return. We recognize revenue: i upon
shipment when products are shipped FOB shipping point, and ii
upon delivery at the customer location when products are
shipped FOB destination.
o  Compression software consists of standard off-the-shelf software
products that are sold to OEM customers that integrate our
software into their equipment-based products. The terms of sale
generally do not contain provisions that obligate us to provide
additional products or services after shipment, other than
technical telephone support for a brief period of time post sale.
The cost of providing technical support is inconsequential
because of the limited scope of the support. Additionally, we do
not grant return rights other than normal warranty rights of
return, and we generally do not customize software for customers.
Occasionally, we sell maintenance contracts that entitle
customers to product updates.
We recognize compression software revenue by applying the
principles set forth in SAB 101 and American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants AICPA Statement of Position No.
97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. Accordingly, we recognize
revenue for software licenses: i upon shipment when products
are shipped FOB shipping point, and ii upon delivery at the
customer
32                  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
location when products are shipped FOB destination. We recognize
revenue for maintenance contracts ratably over the related
contract period.
CONTRACT REVENUE. We enter into nonexclusive technology licensing
agreements with semiconductor licensees that contain terms and conditions
that have historically varied by licensee. Such agreements generally
require us to provide: i intellectual property, which consists primarily
of integrated circuit designs; ii engineering services; and iii the
right to incorporate our intellectual property components and patented
technology into our customers' products. Generally our licensing agreements
include one or more of the following elements of financial consideration to
us: i technology license fees; ii engineering service fees, and iii
royalty payments. We classify license and engineering service fees received
under licensing agreements as contract revenue.
Technology license fees and engineering service fees are paid during
product development and royalties are paid once customers begin shipping
products that incorporate our technology. License fees are typically
payable on an upfront basis or in lump sums at various points during a
development project. Engineering services fees are typically paid on a more
uniform basis throughout the project to reflect the level of engineering
services being performed. In addition, customers may engage us to provide
on-going engineering services or support after a project has been
completed.
Revenue recognition for contract revenue is based on whether a licensing
agreement contains a single element of either license fees or engineering
service fees, or whether a licensing agreement contains multiple elements
of both license fees and engineering service fees. Our revenue recognition
policy for each type of licensing agreement is described as follows      SINGLE ELEMENT LICENSING AGREEMENTS. To the extent that the single
element contained in a licensing agreement is for technology only,
then technology license fees are recognized as revenue when technology
transfers have been effected and no contingent factors are present. To
the extent that the single element contained in a licensing agreement
is for engineering services only, then engineering services are
recognized as revenue when the defined milestones are completed.
Engineering milestones have historically been formulated to correlate
with the estimated level of effort and related costs.
MULTIPLE ELEMENT LICENSING AGREEMENTS. Contract revenue under multiple
element agreements is recognized by recording total license and
engineering fees for the entire contract on a straight-line basis over
the estimated contract performance period, subject to the limitation
that cumulative revenue through the end of any period may not exceed
cumulative contract payments through that same period. Based on our
multiple element licensing agreements, we believe that the
straight-line method represents the appropriate systematic method for
revenue recognition.
ROYALTY REVENUE. Royalty revenue is generally recognized in the quarter in
which a report is received from a licensee detailing the shipments of
products incorporating our intellectual property components i.e., in the
quarter following the sales of the licensed product by the licensee. The
terms of our licensing agreements generally require licensees to give
notification to us and to pay royalties within 45 to 60 days of the end of
the quarter during which sales of licensed products take place.
CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE - Effective January 1, 2000 we changed our
method of revenue recognition in accordance with Securities and Exchange
Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements. Previously, we recognized contract revenue under
multiple element agreements upon completion of contract milestones or upon
transfer of intellectual property. Under the accounting method we adopted
retroactive to January 1, 2000, we now recognize contract revenue under
multiple element agreements by recording total license and engineering fees
for the entire contract on a straight-line basis over the estimated
contract performance period, subject to the limitation that cumulative
revenue through the end of any period may not exceed cumulative contract
payments through that same period. The cumulative effect of the change on
prior years resulted in a charge to income of $16 million for the year
ended December 31, 2000. For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, we
recognized $09 million and $07 million in revenue, respectively, that was
included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1, 2000.

AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
INCOME TAXES - We compute deferred income taxes based on the differences
between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities
using enacted rates in effect in the years in which the differences are
expected to reverse. We must establish a valuation allowance to offset
temporary deductible differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax
credits when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will
not be realized.
CAPITALIZATION OF SOFTWARE COSTS - We capitalize certain internally
generated software development costs after technological feasibility of the
product has been established. No software costs were capitalized for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, because such costs incurred
subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility, but prior to
commercial availability, were immaterial.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK - At December 31, 2002 and 2001, we had cash
and investments, in excess of federally insured deposit limits of
approximately $470 million and $572 million, respectively.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to net accounts receivable
consists of $06 million, $04 million, and $02 million with three
customers at December 31, 2002 and $07 million, $03 million, $02
million, and $01 million with four customers at December 31, 2001.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION - We grant stock options to our employees and
directors. Such grants are for a fixed number of shares with an exercise
price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. As
permitted by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, we
account for stock option grants in accordance with Accounting Principles
Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
and FASB Interpretation No. 44 FIN 44, Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation. Accordingly, we have adopted
the provisions of SFAS No. 123 through disclosure only.
At December 31, 2002, we have four stock-based employee compensation plans,
which are described more fully in Note 6. No stock-based employee
compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under
those plans had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. The following table
illustrates the pro forma effect on net income loss and earnings per
share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.
123 and SFAS No. 148 to stock-based employee compensation in thousands,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
COMPUTATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE - Basic earnings per share is computed by
dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed
by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding plus additional common shares that
would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been
issued. For the purposes of this calculation, stock options are considered
common stock equivalents in periods in which they have a dilutive effect.
Stock options that are antidilutive are excluded from the calculation.
USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of our financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include revenue
recognition, reserves for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and
obsolete inventory, useful lives of fixed assets, valuation allowance for
deferred income tax assets, and accrued liabilities. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - The carrying amounts of cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of their short-term
nature.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS - Comprehensive income loss is defined as the
change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions
and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, including
foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on
marketable securities. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000, comprehensive income loss was not materially different from net
income loss.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No.
146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
SFAS 146. This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting
for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supercedes EITF
Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs
Incurred in a Restructuring EITF 94-3. SFAS 146 requires that a
liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be
recognized when the liability is incurred. EITF 94-3 allowed for an exit
cost liability to be recognized at the date of an entity commitment to an
exit plan. SFAS 146 also requires that liabilities recorded in connection
with exit plans be initially measured at fair value. The provisions of SFAS
146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after
December 31, 2002, with early adoption encouraged. We do not expect the
adoption of SFAS 146 will have a material impact on our financial position
or results of operations.
In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure - An Amendment of SFAS No. 123.
SFAS 148 amends SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation to
provide alternative methods of transition for those companies who
voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the
disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in
both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the
method used on reported results. The transition and annual disclosure
provisions of SFAS 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December
15, 2002. We have not adopted the fair value method of accounting for
stock-based compensation, and will continue to apply APB 25 for our
stock-based compensation plans. We have adopted the disclosure requirements
of SFAS 148 in this Form 10-K, which is included in the Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies footnote of our consolidated financial
statements.
In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 FIN 45,
Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. This
interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in
its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under
certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor
is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for
the fair value of the obligation undertaken
35                  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
in issuing the guarantee. This interpretation does not prescribe a specific
approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor recognized liability
over the term of the related guarantee. This interpretation also
incorporates, without change, the guidance in FASB Interpretation No. 34,
Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, which is
being superseded. The disclosure requirements of this interpretation are
effective for interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2002.
Recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 become effective for
guarantees issued or modified on or after January 1, 2003. We are currently
assessing the impact of adopting the recognition and initial measurement
provisions of this new interpretation.
In November 2002, the EITF issued No. 00-21, Accounting for Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF Issue No. 00-21 addresses
certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which
it will perform multiple revenue-generating activities. EITF Issue No.
00-21 establishes three principles: revenue should be recognized separately
for separate units of accounting, revenue for a separate unit of accounting
should be recognized only when the arrangement consideration is reliably
measurable and the earnings process is substantially complete, and
consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting in
an arrangement based on their relative fair values. EITF Issue No. 00-21 is
effective for all revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods
beginning after June 15, 2003, with early adoption permitted. We are
currently determining the impact, if any, EITF Issue No. 00-21 will have on
our financial position and results of operations.
SEGMENTS - We organize ourselves as one segment reporting to the chief
operating decision-maker. We have sales outside of the United States, which
are described in Note 8. All long-lived assets are maintained in the United
States. 3.  INVENTORIES

We have evaluated the positive and negative evidence affecting the
realizability of our deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2002, based on
the weight of the available evidence, we determined that it is more likely
than not that all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, and
fully reserved our deferred tax assets. We will continue to evaluate, on a
quarterly basis, the positive and negative evidence affecting the
realizability of our deferred tax assets.
At December 31, 2002, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $482 million, which begin to expire in 2007, and federal
research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $79
million, which begin to expire in 2003. At December 31, 2002, we also had
available state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $483
million, which begin to expire in 2003, and state research and development
and investment tax credit carryforwards of approximately $40 million,
which begin to expire in 2003.
Of the total net operating loss and research and development tax credit
carryforwards for which a valuation allowance was recorded, approximately
$245 million is attributable to the exercise of stock options and the tax
benefit will be credited to additional paid-in capital, if realized in the
future. 6.  EQUITY AND STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS
At December 31, 2002, we have four stock-based compensation plans, which
are described below.
FIXED STOCK OPTION PLANS - We have three fixed option plans. Under the 1990
Incentive and Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan 1990 Plan, we may grant
incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options to our employees and
directors for up to 2,873,002 shares of common stock. Under the 1996 Stock
Option Plan 1996 Plan, we may grant incentive stock options or
nonqualified stock options to our employees and directors for up to
6,100,000 shares of common stock. Under the 2001 Nonqualified Stock Plan
2001 Plan, we may grant nonqualified stock options to our employees and
directors for up to 8,000,000 shares of
37                  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
common stock. Under all three plans, options are granted at an exercise
price as determined by the Board of Directors; have a maximum term of ten
years; and generally vest over three to five years. As of December 31,
2002, there were 4,573,925 shares available for grant under the 2001 Plan,
678,740 shares available for grant under the 1996 Plan, and no shares
available under the 1990 Plan.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN - In June 1996, we adopted an Employee Stock
Purchase Plan the ESPP Plan under which eligible employees may purchase
common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value
of the common stock at the beginning or end of each six-month offering
period. Participation in the ESPP Plan is limited to 6% of an employee
compensation, may be terminated at any time by the employee and
automatically ends on termination of employment. A total of 100,000 shares
of common stock have been reserved for issuance. As of December 31, 2002
there were 20,303 shares available for future issuance under the ESPP Plan.
We issued 30,694, 27,733 and 7,808 common shares under the ESPP Plan in
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN - In October 2001, our board of directors adopted a
stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one share
purchase right a Right for each outstanding share of our common stock
to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 15, 2001.
Each share of common stock issued after that date also will carry with it
one Right, subject to certain exceptions. Each Right, when it
38                  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
becomes exercisable, will entitle the record holder to purchase from us one
ten-thousandth of a share of series A preferred stock at an exercise price
of $4000 subject to adjustment.
The Rights become exercisable upon the earliest of the following dates: i
the date on which we first publicly announce that a person or group has
become an acquiring person, or ii the date, if any, that our board of
directors may designate following the commencement of, or first public
disclosure of an intent to commence, a tender or exchange offer which could
result in the potential buyer becoming a beneficial owner of 15% or more of
our outstanding common stock. Under these circumstances, holders of Rights
will be entitled to purchase, for the exercise price, the preferred stock
equivalent of common stock having a market value of two times the exercise
price. The Rights expire on October 2, 2011, and may be redeemed by us for
$001 per Right.
EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXCHANGE PROGRAM - On March 3, 2003, we commenced an
offer to exchange outstanding stock options with eligible employees. Under
the terms of the program, eligible employees have the right to tender for
cancellation all stock options that they hold with an exercise price above
$300 per share. Employees electing to participate must tender all such
outstanding stock options held by them by the end of the day on April 1,
2003. In return, employees will receive replacement stock options that will
be granted between October 2, 2003 and November 13, 2003. Employees will
receive replacement options based on a formula that allows them to purchase
one share of common stock for every two option shares surrendered by them.
Replacement grants will be priced at the current market value of our stock
on the replacement grant date. 7.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
LEASE COMMITMENTS - We own our principal office and research facility in
Bedford, Massachusetts, which we have occupied since November 1997. We
conduct a portion of our activities in leased facilities in Lafayette,
California under a non-cancellable operating lease that expires in 2004.

Rental expense was approximately $44,000, $36,000 and $105,000 in 2002,

LITIGATION - There are no material pending legal proceedings to which we
are a party or to which any of our properties are subject which, either
individually or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.
GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS - We enter into licensing
agreements in the ordinary course of business that requires us: ito
perform under the terms of the contracts, ii to protect the
confidentiality of our customers' intellectual property, and iii to
indemnify customers, including indemnification against third party claims
alleging infringement of intellectual property rights. We also have
agreements with each of our directors and executive officers to indemnify
such directors or executive officers, to the extent legally permissable,
against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action
in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being
or having been a director or officer of Aware.
Given the nature of the above obligations and agreements, we are unable to
make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount that we could be
required to pay. Historically, we have not made any significant payments on
the above guarantees and indemnifications and no amount has been accrued in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these
guarantees and indemnifications.

equivalents of 226,303 and 285,427, respectively, were not included in the
per share calculation for diluted EPS, because we had a net loss and the
effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. For the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, options to purchase 4,770,052, 3,488,215
and 1,508,194 shares of common stock at average weighted prices of $2354,
$3195 and $4753 per share, respectively, were outstanding, but were not
included in the computation of diluted EPS because the options' exercise
prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares and
thus would be anti-dilutive.
