To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of Sun Hydraulics Corporation
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity and
comprehensive income, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Sun Hydraulics Corporation and its
subsidiaries at January 1, 2000 and December 31, 1998, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, which require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for the opinion expressed above. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

4.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the
preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements is set forth
below PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and
operations of Sun Hydraulics and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in
consolidation.
MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
52 WEEK FISCAL YEAR
Commencing in 1999, the Company implemented a fiscal year which ends
on the Saturday nearest to the end of the month of December. Each quarter
consists of two 4-week periods and one 5-week period.                    42
43
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, cost being
determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Expenditures for
repairs and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or
extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance are
expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight line method
over the following useful lives                             Years
Software and computer equipment     3 - 5
Machinery and equipment         4 - 12
Furniture and fixtures         4 - 10
Leasehold and land improvements     5 - 15
Buildings                  40 CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS
Capitalized software costs are accounted for under Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use SOP 98-1
and are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Software is capitalized
upon the successful testing of the system. Depreciation is charged to income
over the estimated useful life of the software. The amount recorded under SOP
98-1 during 1999, was $528, and was capitalized upon completion.
VALUATION ASSESSMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Management periodically evaluates long-lived assets for potential
impairment and will reserve for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully
recoverable. As of January 1, 2000, management does not believe that an

45 INCOME TAXES
The Company follows the income tax policy provided by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This
Statement provides for a liability approach under which deferred income taxes
are provided for based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the

assets, equity, net income, or total cash flows.
5.    FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the
instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties,
other than in a forced sale or liquidation. The following methods and
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial
instruments.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other
liabilities approximate fair value due to the nature of their short maturities.
The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair value, as the
interest rates on the debt approximate rates currently available to the Company
for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.
The fair value of the notes payable to related parties is estimated
based on the current rates offered to the Company for similar debt. The
estimated fair value of the Company related party notes payable is
approximately $495, and $1,133 at January 1, 2000, and December 31, 1998,
respectively.                    45

A 10-year mortgage loan of $6,187 was obtained, at a fixed interest
rate of 825%, for construction of the Manatee County facility. Terms on the
construction note were interest-only on the balance drawn down through the

2000, $4,725 was outstanding under this mortgage loan.
In May 1996, the Company obtained a mortgage loan of approximately
$2,400, denominated in German marks, for the new facility in Erkelenz, Germany.
This loan had a term of 12 years with variable interest of 647%. During 1999,
the Company renegotiated this loan with a mortgage note, bearing fixed interest
at 605%, with monthly payments of approximately $24, and a maturity date of
September 30, 2008. At January 1, 2000, $1,352 was outstanding under this

approximately $300, a ten year 51% fixed interest rate loan for approximately
$100, and a ten year 35% fixed interest rate loan for approximately $800. At
January 1, 2000, the outstanding balances on these facilities were $237, $0,
and $696, respectively.

common                    51
52
share on the date of the grant not less than 110% of the fair value in the
case of holders of more than 10% of the Company voting stock. Nonqualified

Directors. The maximum term of an option may not exceed 10 years, and options
become exercisable at such times and in such installments as determined by the
Board of Directors.

The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No.
123. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the stock option
plans other than for nonqualified stock options. Had compensation costs for the
stock option plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant date
for awards in 1998 and 1997 consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the
Company net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro
forma amounts indicated below                          For the year ended

disclosures since the estimated fair value of stock options is amortized to
expense over the vesting period and additional options may be granted in future
years. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 1998 and 1997: cumulative
volatility of 4309%, and 3956% for 1998 and 1997, respectively; dividend
yields of 168%, and 168%, for 1998 and 1997, respectively; risk-free interest
rate of 557%, and 572%, for 1998 and 1997, respectively; and expected term of
659 years, and 604 years for 1998 and 1997, respectively. 14.   EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE
The Company calculates its earnings per share EPS using Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share SFAS 128.
Basic EPS is calculated as net income divided by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding.
Diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method under which
net income is divided by the weighted average number of common and common
equivalent shares outstanding during the year. Common stock equivalents consist
of options.                    53

foreign operations in addition to mandatory benefits included in local country
payroll tax statutes. These supplemental pension benefits amounted to
approximately $124, $93, and $81, during 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
16.    SEGMENT REPORTING
In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Accounting Standards No.
131, Disclosures about Segments of Enterprise and Related Information SFAS
131. SFAS 131 supercedes SFAS 14, Financial Reporting for Segments of a
Business Enterprise, replacing the industry segment approach with the
management approach of determining reportable segments of an organization.
The management approach designates the internal organization that is used by
management for making operation decisions and addressing performance as the
source of determining the Company reportable segments. Management bases its
financial decisions by the geographical location of its operations.
The individual subsidiaries comprising the Company operate
predominantly in a single industry as manufacturers and distributors of
hydraulic components. The subsidiaries are multinational with operations in the
United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Korea. In computing earnings
from operations for the foreign subsidiaries, no allocations of general
corporate expenses, interest or income taxes have been made.
Identifiable assets of the foreign subsidiaries are those assets
related to the operation of those companies. United States assets consist of
all other operating assets of the Company.

17.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is not a party to any legal proceedings other than routine
litigation incidental to its business. In the opinion of management, the amount
of ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect
the financial position of the Company.
In 1996, the Company was awarded a grant of 711 Deustche Marks
approximately $424, by the German government, which helped to offset the cost
of the German facility. This grant required that the German operation employ 26
people by June 30, 1998. The Company did not meet this headcount requirement
and was granted an extension. If the Company fails to meet the terms of the
grant, approximately 50% of the grant will be repaid. This amount has been
recorded as a deferred grant. The repayment would affect cash and would have no
effect on net income.
The Company received a business interruption insurance claim of $1,821
$1,661, net of expenses, from its insurance carrier in 1998 and is recorded
in miscellaneous income. The claim was related to a fire in the Manatee County
facility which occurred while the plant was under construction. The Company
believes that this fire delayed the opening of the new plant which in turn
delayed the rearrangement of the cartridge operation and the creation of the
cellular production for high volume models.                    56
