information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within
the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rulesand
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management
recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance

believes that they meet, reasonable assurance standards, subject to the
