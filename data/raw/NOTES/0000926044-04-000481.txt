Item 8 Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data and Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies. We recognize revenues on a majority
of contracts relating to the construction and sale of thin film deposition equipment using
the percentage-of-completion method in accordance with the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants AICPA Statement of Position SOP No. 81-1,
Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type
Contracts. Pursuant to SOP 81-1, revenues are measured by the percentage of the
total costs incurred and applied to date in relation to the estimated total costs to be
incurred for each contract. Our management considers costs incurred and applied to be the
best available measure of progress on these contracts. Contract costs include all direct
material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance.
General, administrative, selling and research and development costs are charged to expense
as incurred. Changes in performance, contract conditions and estimated profitability,
including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements,
may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the
revisions are determined. We generally offer warranty coverage
for equipment sold for a one-year period after final installation is complete. We estimate
the anticipated costs to be incurred during the warranty period and accrue a reserve as a
percentage of revenue as revenue is recognized. In addition, specific reserves are
provided for known and anticipated problems. These reserves are evaluated periodically
based on actual experience and anticipated activity and are adjusted if necessary. We maintain an allowance for doubtful
accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make
required payments. We determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly evaluating
individual customer receivables and considering a customers financial condition,
credit history, and current economic conditions. If the financial condition of our
customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required. In consolidation, the financial
results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using the current
rate method. Assets and liabilities are translated at the period-end spot exchange rate,
revenues and expenses at average exchange rates and equity transactions at historical
exchange rates. Exchange differences arising on translation are recorded as a component of
other cumulative comprehensive income loss. We write down our inventory for
estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost
of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and
market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by
management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. We estimate our actual current tax
exposure together with the temporary differences that have resulted from the differing
treatment of items dictated by U.S. GAAP versus U.S. tax laws. These temporary differences
result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we assess the
likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. If
we believe that the recovery were less likely, we establish a valuation allowance against
the deferred tax asset and charge the amount as an income tax expense in the period in
which such a determination is made. Page 31 of 63 Liquidity and Capital
Resources We have funded our operations with
cash balances, cash generated from operations, proceeds from public offerings of our
common stock and bank borrowings. Cash used in operating activities was $47 million for
fiscal 2002, $43million for fiscal 2003 and $93million for fiscal 2004. As
of June26,2004, we had cash and marketable securities of approximately
$1527million consisting of cash and cash equivalents of approximately
$160million, restricted cash of approximately $21million, and marketable
securities of $1346million. Total working capital was $1893million. We have established a post closing
escrow account in accordance with the purchase and sale agreement with Helix Technology.
At June 26, 2004, we have $35 million remaining in the escrow account. Capital expenditures were
$09million for fiscal 2002, $14million for fiscal 2003, and
$94million for fiscal 2004. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately
$55million in fiscal 2005. Our capital
expenditures have consisted primarily of purchases and manufacturing of process equipment
related to product development. The increase in capital expenditures in 2004 is related to
the investment in larger size display lab equipment for the development of hardware and
process technologies for the FPD market and alpha and beta systems related to the
development of our TRITON system for TFT array. Cash used for investing activities
was $506million, $95million and $1047million in fiscal 2002, 2003 and
2004, respectively. During fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004, we had net purchases of marketable
securities of $402million, $81million and $823million, respectively.
During fiscal year 2004, we completed the acquisition of Helix for approximately
$130million cash and stock valued at $21million. Cash generated from financing
activities was $608million, $30million, and $1002million for fiscal
2002, fiscal 2003, and fiscal 2004, respectively. The fiscal 2004 increase is primarily due to the
cash raised of $940 million from the public offering of stock for 3,450,000 shares of
common stock at $2875 per share, which closed in October of 2003. We believe that our working capital
and operating needs will continue to be met by cash on hand, and cash from operations. Our
operating capital requirements depend on a number of factors, including the amount and
timing of orders we receive, the timing of payments received from customers, and capital
requirements associated with new product introductions. If we require additional capital,
we may consider various alternatives such as an additional bank financing or the public or
private sale of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that we will be able
to raise such funds on satisfactory terms if and when such funds are needed. Contractual Obligations

There were no currency forward
contracts outstanding as of June26,2004. Page 32 of 63 Operating leases primarily include
leases for offices, factories and office equipment throughout our operations. The bank
guaranty represents progress payments made to the Company, primarily from customers in
China, deposited in a restricted account until the contract terms are fulfilled
andthe guarantys required by the German government for custom duties on
imports received into Germany. Our other commercial commitments consist of software
licenses and third party service contracts. Recent Accounting
Standards In January 2003, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Interpretation 46 FIN 46, Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 requires an investor with a majority of the
variable interests in a variable interest entity to consolidate the entity and also
requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain
disclosures. A variable interest entity is an entity in which the equity investors do not
have a controlling interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance
the entitys activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support
from the other parties. FIN 46 was effective for variable interest entities created after
January 31, 2003 and for older entities in the first reporting period beginning after June
15, 2003. We do not have any variable interest entities, and
have not created any variable interest entities. ITEM 7A: Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market Risk Exposure Market risk represents the risk of
loss that may impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows due to
adverse changes in financial market prices. Our exposure to market risk for changes in
interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. We generally place our
investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy are averse to principal loss
and seek to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk
and reinvestment risk. As of June 26, 2004, our investments
consisted primarily of equity securities, corporate, government and municipal bonds, money
market mutual funds and restricted cash of $21million. These investments earned approximately
$21million for fiscal year 2004, at an average interest rate of approximately 17%.
The impact on interest income of a decrease of one percent in the average interest rate
would have resulted in a decline of approximately $11million of interest income for
fiscal year 2004. Foreign Exchange Exposure We are exposed to foreign exchange
risk associated with accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies. At
June 26, 2004, we had approximately $140million of accounts receivable and
approximately $222million of accounts payable denominated in Euros. A one percent
change in exchange rates would result in an approximate $81,000 net impact on pre-tax
income based on the foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable
balances at June 26, 2004. Sales of our products are denominated
primarily in Euros. Historically, we engaged in international currency hedging transactions to
mitigate our foreign exchange exposure related to sales of certain equipment, and the
effects of foreign exchange rate changes on foreign currency transactions. Currency
hedging transactions have not been significant to date. Notwithstanding the above, actual
changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates could adversely affect our operating
results or financial condition. The potential impact depends upon the magnitude of the
rate change. We are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange
rates primarily in our cash balance, foreign currency transactions and the operating
results of our foreign affiliates. International manufacturing
operations are based in Germany and in the future will be expanded to
Taiwan. These operations constitute a significant portion of our revenues
and identifiable assets. These identifiable assets are based in Euros in Germany and
are based in New Taiwan dollars in Taiwan. International operations result in a large volume
of foreign currency commitments and transactions and significant foreign currency net
asset exposures. Page 33 of 63 Our cash position includes amounts
denominated in foreign currencies, primarily Euros. The repatriation of cash balances from
certain of our affiliates could have adverse consequences to the statement of operations
as well as adverse tax consequences. However, those balances are generally available
without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations, with the exception of
approximately $35million which is in a post closing escrow account to be used for
the acquisition of Helix Note 12, and with the exception of $59million of
guarantys related to progress payments primarily from our customers in China and
custom duties for items received in Germany. The $59million guaranty is comprised
of $21million of pledged cash and $38million which is pledged under a line
of credit. Our bank guaranty securing 50% of the China JV debt was released
in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. Page 34 of 63 FORWARD LOOKING

Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Applied Films Corporation: We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Applied Films Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 26,
2004, and June 28, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
June 26, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule included in a2 for the fiscal years ended June 26, 2004, June 28, 2003, and June 29, 2002. These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. In our opinion, the financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Applied Films Corporation and subsidiaries at June 26, 2004 and June
28, 2003, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended June 26, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. s/ ERNST YOUNG

Corporation and SubsidiariesNotes to Consolidated
Financial Statements June 26, 2004 NOTE 1: COMPANY
ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS Applied Films Corporation
Applied Films, the Company, we, or our
is a leading provider of thin film deposition equipment to diverse markets such as the
flat panel display FPD, the architectural and solar glass, and
the consumer products packaging and electronics industries. Our deposition systems are
used to deposit thin films that enhance the characteristics of a base substrate, such as
glass, plastic, paper or foil. These thin films provide conductive, electronic,
reflective, filter, barrier and other properties that are critical elements of our
customers products. Our thin film deposition systems provide our customers with high
yield and throughput, flexible modular configurations, and innovative coating and process
technologies. We have exited the contract coated
glass business over the last six years. Beginning in fiscal 1999, we moved the majority of
our production of coated glass from Longmont to our joint venture in China China JV.
Because of the 50%-50% ownership structure of our China JV, the revenues and expenses of
our China JV are not consolidated and do not appear as revenues and expenses in our
financial statements. Our 50% portion of the China JV net income is reported as
Equity earnings of joint venture in our consolidated statements of operations.
In September2002, we sold our Longmont coatings division, which included certain
assets related to our contract glass coating business, to Optera, Inc. In September 2003,
we sold our coated glass sales business located in Hong Kong to Nippon Sheet Glass Co.,
Ltd. NSG. The financial statements for the prior periods have been restated to reflect
the effect of the sale of those businesses and the results have been included as
discontinued operations. Over the last four years, we have
enhanced our position as a market leading manufacturer of thin film deposition equipment.
In December 2000, we completed the acquisition of the LAC business of Unaxis which
improved our position in FPD and enabled our entry into additional markets. In June2004, we completed the
acquisition of the In-Line Systems division of Helix Technology, Inc. in Taiwan. The
acquisition provides us with an additional 32 people who are familiar with our products,
as well as a facility that will serve as our Asian manufacturing base, where we expect to
manufacture some of our display systems beginning late in fiscal 2005. We believe
manufacturing in Taiwan will allow us to reduce our manufacturing costs, and reduce the
transit time for systems sold to our customers in Asia. The addition of technical
personnel in Asia will enhance our customer service. Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. NOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of
Consolidation  The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. The results of the China JV are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting in the consolidated financial statements and the results appear in Equity
earnings of Joint Venture Note 5. Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Fiscal Year  The Company has adopted a fiscal year
ending on the Saturday nearest June 30, which will result in fiscal years composed of 52
or 53 weeks. Fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002 all include 52 weeks. Page 42 of 63 Cash and Cash
Equivalents  The Company generally considers all
highly liquid investments with an original maturity of less than 90 days to be cash
equivalents. Restricted Cash  At June 26, 2004 and June 28, 2003,
the Company has pledged $21million and $141million, respectively, in cash,
to provide security for bank guarantys to certain customers in China, for their cash
deposits on contracts. The Company also has $38million of guarantys which are
pledged under a line of credit at June26,2004. At June 28, 2003, the Company
had pledged $50million in cash to provide the bank guaranty for 50% of the debt of
the China JV. This guaranty was released in fiscal 2004. Marketable Securities  Through April 20, 2004, the Company
classified all of its short-term investments that do not qualify as cash equivalents as
trading securities. Starting on April 21, 2004, the Company elected to reclassify all of
its short-term investments from trading securities to available-for-sale securities.
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and
losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses and
declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are
included in interest income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific
identification method. Interest and dividends on securities classified as
available-for-sale are included in interest income. Securities held principally for the
purpose of selling them in the near future are classified as trading securities. Since
1997 we have classified our investments as trading securities and in April 2004, in
accordance with SFAS 115, we determined that a more appropriate classification is to
classify our investments as securities available for sale, because the securities are not
held to make a profit from short-term fluctuations in market prices. We commonly hold our
investments to maturity but can sell them at any time as short term cash needs arise. The following is a summary of the
Companys available-for-sale securities as of June 26, 2004 in thousands:

During the period April 21, 2004
through June 26, 2004, marketable equity available-for-sale securities with a fair value
at the date of sale of $279million were sold. The gross realized gains on such
sales totaled $4,000. Through April 20, 2004, the Company recognized $434,000 of
unrealized losses with respect to trading securities. Upon the reclassification of
securities from trading to available-for-sale, in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard SFAS 115, the Company recorded an unrealized loss on marketable
securities of $429,000 net of tax, in other comprehensive income, through the end of
fiscal year 2004. At June 28, 2003, the Companys

Depreciation expense was

ended June 26,2004, June28,2003, and June29,2002,
respectively. Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets  The goodwill and intangible assets
are carried on the balance sheet of the Companys German subsidiary and Tainan,
Taiwan subsidiary. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company completed the
acquisition of the In-Line Systems division of Helix Technology in Tainan, Taiwan. As a
result of the acquisition, the Company has preliminarily recorded approximately $11
million and $10 million of patents and customer lists, respectively. The Company is in
the process of completing a fair value analysis of the assets. Upon completion of this
analysis, these preliminary amounts may change. Increases or decreases in the book value
are due to currency fluctuation between the U.S. dollar, the Euro, and the Taiwan dollar.
The increase in accumulated amortization of intangible assets is due to the current
amortization expense in the current period and currency fluctuation between the U.S.
dollar, the Euro, and the Taiwan dollar. The composition of intangible assets follows in
thousands: Page 44 of 63

The patents are amortized over seven
years and the customer lists are amortized over five years. As a result of adopting SFAS
No. 142, the Company no longer recognizes amortization expense on its goodwill. Annually,
and more frequently if a triggering event occurs, the Company is required to test the
carrying value of goodwill for impairment. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 the
annual impairment test on the goodwill recorded with respect to the LAC acquisition was
completed and it was determined that there was no impairment of the goodwill related to the LAC
acquisition. The aggregate amortization expense
for fiscal years ended June26,2004, June28,2003, and
June29,2002 is $43million, $38million, and $34million,
respectively. The intangible asset balances are reported on the German and Taiwan
subsidiarys balance sheets and will be subject to unrealized foreign exchange
fluctuations between the Euro, the Taiwan dollar and the U.S. dollar. The estimated
aggregate amortization expense for the intangible assets for each of the five succeeding
fiscal years is estimated as follows in thousands:

Impairment of Long
Lived Assets  With the exception of goodwill, the
Company evaluates the carrying value of all long-lived assets whenever events or
circumstances indicate the carrying value of assets may exceed their recoverable amounts.
An impairment loss would be recognized when the undiscounted estimated future cash flows
expected to result from the use of an asset are less than the carrying amount of the
asset. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on fair value of the asset computed
using discounted cash flows if the asset is expected to be held and used. Measurement of
an impairment loss for an asset held for sale would be based on fair market value less
estimated costs to sell. The Company performs an annual
impairment test to ensure that the fair value of the asset exceeds the carrying value of
its China JV on the Companys balance sheet. The annual impairment test that was
completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 determined that there was no impairment
of the investment in the China JV. The Company believes no circumstances
indicating an impairment exists in any of its other long-lived assets. Accrued Expenses:  The significant components of accrued expenses

Accrued losses on contracts are costs
incurred on specific projects in excess of the contracted revenue. Accrued losses on
contracts are recognized when the loss becomes probable and the amount of loss can be
reasonably estimated. Loss provisions are based upon excess costs over the net revenue
from the products contemplated by the specific order. Contract accounting requires
management to make estimates of future costs over the performance period of the contract.
These estimates are subject to change and result in adjustments to cost of goods sold,
which are reflected in the margins on contracts in progress. Page 45 of 63 Accrued compensation represents those
costs associated with employee compensation costs such as salaries, vacation, bonus,
profit sharing, anniversary awards, insurance benefits and taxes. Accrued warranty represents the
estimated warranty costs associated with contracts in progress and completed projects that
have entered into the warranty period. Accrued warranty is calculated as a percentage of
the total project costs. These costs are amortized over the life of the warranty period
for each specific project. Other accruals represent all other
incurred and anticipated costs, not included in the categories above such as insurance,
accounting, legal, and non-payroll related benefits. Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes
in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. SFAS 109 requires
deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recognized for temporary differences between the
tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities, computed at current tax
rates. Also, the Companys deferred income tax assets include certain future tax
benefits. The Company records a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred
income tax assets, which it believes, it will more likely than not fail to realize. The China JV earnings are taxed in
its local jurisdiction and therefore no provision for taxes on earnings has been accrued
in the Companys tax provision during fiscal years 2002, 2003 and 2004. Deferred Gain  During 1997, the Company entered into
a lease transaction with a third party for the Companys manufacturing and
administrative facility in Longmont, Colorado, which included a purchase option early in
the lease period. The Company sold this purchase option to another third party, who
exercised this option and purchased the building. The Company then entered into a new
lease of the facility, which includes a purchase option Note 10. The Company received
$834,000 from the original purchase option, which is deferred and is shown on the balance
sheet in current and long term liabilities as deferred gain and is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease of 15 years. Spare Parts Revenue
Recognition  Spare parts revenues and related
costs are recognized when title to the goods passes to the customer according to the terms
specified in the purchase order. The Companys spare parts are warranted to be free
from material defects caused by workmanship and within its design or customer
specifications and are inspected for workmanship and compliance to specification prior to
shipment. Customers who experience defects in material may return product for credit or
replacement. Applied Films maintains a reserve to cover sales returns for quality defects
from its customers. The provision for estimated sales returns and allowances is recorded
in the period of the sale and is typically in the range of 05% to 10% of sales. Equipment Sales
Revenue Recognition  The percentage of completion method
of accounting is used for products valued at greater than $1 million and a construction
time of greater than six months. In accordance with the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants AICPA Statement of Position SOP 81-1,
Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type
Contracts. Pursuant to SOP 81-1, revenues are measured by the percentage of the
total costs incurred and applied to date in relation to the estimated total costs to be
incurred for each contract. Management considers costs incurred to be the best available
measure of progress on these contracts. Contract costs include all direct material and
labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance. General and
administrative costs are expensed as incurred. Changes in performance, contract conditions
and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and
final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized
in the period in which the revisions are determined. The Company contracts under the percentage of
completion method do not provide for the right of a customer to return the machine once
title has transferred. Page 46 of 63 Revenues in excess of billings
represent revenues recognized under the percentage of completion method prior to billing
the customer for contractual cash payments. Billings in excess of revenue represent
amounts billed pursuant to the contract terms, which occur prior to the Companys
recognition of revenues on the contract for financial reporting purposes. Contracts in progress are as follows in thousands

The Company typically collects 80-85%
of the cash due on the total project by the time the equipment ships from its facility.
The remaining 15-20% balance that is due following the ship date, is billed in accordance
with the contract terms and those subsequent billings are generally collected within 30
days after billing. The Company generally offers warranty
coverage for equipment sales for a period of one year after final installation is
complete. The Company estimates the anticipated costs to be incurred during the warranty
period and accrues a reserve as a percentage of revenue as revenue is recognized. These
reserves are evaluated periodically based on actual experience and anticipated activity
and are adjusted if necessary. Changes in the Companys product
warranty liability were as follows in thousands:

The completed contract method of
accounting is used for standard products that are typically valued at less than $1 million
and have a machine construction time of less than six months. For projects accounted for
using the completed contract method of accounting, we accumulate the project costs in work
in process until we complete the fabrication of the system. Once fabrication of the system
is complete, the customer evaluates the machine at Applied Films manufacturing
facility according to any specific acceptance criteria outlined in the contract. Upon
acceptance, the machine is shipped and installed at the customers facility and title
is transferred to the customer. Applied Films recognizes the revenue, upon transfer of
title. Our contracts under the completed contract method do not provide for the right of a
customer to return the machine once title has transferred. Deferred Gross Profit  During fiscal years 2002, 2001 and
1999, the Company sold certain thin film deposition equipment to the China JV
Note5. Because the Company owns 50% of the China JV, the Company recorded 50% of
the revenue and related cost of the sales and has deferred 50% of the gross profit,
approximately $00, $13 million and $14 million, respectively, which will be recognized
on a straight-line basis over ten years, consistent with the depreciation schedule at the
China JV and the estimated depreciable life of the equipment. The thin film equipment sold
to the China JV in fiscal year 2002 was sold at cost and did not result in gross profit.
The amortization of the gross profit is included with Equity earnings of joint
venture in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The deferred
gross profit recognized in fiscal 2004 was $297,000 and $297,000 for fiscal 2003. The
remaining deferred gross profit was $16million on June26,2004 19million on June28,2003, and $22million on
June29,2002. Research and
Development Expenses  Research and development costs are
expensed as incurred and consist primarily of salaries, supplies, lab expenses, and
depreciation of equipment used in research and development activities. The Company
incurred approximately $168million, $122 million, and $92 million, of research
and development expenses for the fiscal years ended June26,2004,
June28,2003, and June29,2002, respectively, net of reimbursements
for funded research and development received from a German governmental agency. The
Company is reimbursed up to 50% of the costs incurred for specific research and
development projects. The reimbursement terms are contained in an agreement between the
Company and the agency and is paid when the research is completed and accepted by the
agency. The Company received reimbursements of $713,000, $599,000, and $795,000, in the
fiscal years ended June26,2004, June28,2003, and
June29,2002, respectively. Page 47 of 63 Foreign Currency
Transactions  The Company generated 81%, 70%, and
58% of its revenues in fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, from sales to
foreign corporations located outside of Europe, which are primarily in Asia and the United
States. In addition, many of its raw materials are purchased from foreign corporations.
The majority of the Companys sales and purchases are denominated in Euros, with the
remainder denominated in U.S. dollars. For those transactions denominated in currencies
other than the functional currency, the Company records the sale or purchase at the spot
exchange rate in effect on the date of sale. Receivables from such sales or payables for
such purchases are converted to the functional currency using the end of the period spot
exchange rate. Realized gains and losses are charged or credited to income during the
year. Foreign Currency
Translation  The financial results of the
Companys foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using the current-rate
method. Assets and liabilities are translated at the year end spot exchange rate, revenue
and expenses at average exchange rates and equity transactions at historical exchange
rates. Exchange differences arising on translation are recorded as a component of other
cumulative comprehensive income loss. Other Cumulative
Comprehensive Loss  SFAS 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income, establishes a standard for reporting and displaying
comprehensive income and its components within the financial statements. Comprehensive
income includes charges and credits to equity that are not the result of transactions with
shareholders. Other cumulative comprehensive income for the Company represents foreign
currency items associated with the translation of the Companys investment in its
foreign subsidiaries and the China JV, unrealized gain on foreign currency hedge
activities and unrealized losses on available for-sale securities. Comprehensive Income

Common Share  The Company follows SFAS 128,
Earnings per Share which establishes standards for computing and presenting
basic and diluted earnings per share EPS. Under this statement, basic
earnings loss per share is computed by dividing the income or loss available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted
earnings per share is determined by dividing the income or loss available to common
stockholders by the sum of 1 the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
and 2 the dilutive effect of outstanding potentially dilutive securities, including
convertible preferred stock, stock options and warrants determined utilizing the treasury
stock method. Diluted loss per share in 2002 is determined by dividing the loss available
to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares; no weight is given to the
dilutive effect of stock options. Page 49 of 63 A reconciliation between the number
of shares used to calculate basic and diluted income loss per share is as follows in

The diluted share base for fiscal
year 2002 excludes incremental shares of 831,000 relating to assuming exercise of stock
options and 546,000 assuming repurchase of treasury shares. These shares are excluded due to
their antidilutive effect as a result of the Companys loss from continuing
operations during fiscal year 2002. Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards 123  SFAS 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, defines a fair value based method of accounting for
employee stock options or similar equity instruments. However, SFAS 123 allows the
continued measurement of compensation cost in the financial statements for such plans
using the intrinsic value based method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, provided
that pro forma disclosures are made of net income or loss, assuming the fair value based
method of SFAS 123 had been applied. The Company has elected to account for its
stock-based compensation plans for employees and directors under APB 25. Accordingly, for purposes of the pro
forma disclosures presented below, the Company has computed the fair values of all options
granted during fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002 using the Black-Scholes pricing model and the
following weighted average assumptions:

Page 50 of 63 To estimate expected lives of options
for this valuation, it was assumed options will be exercised at varying schedules after
becoming fully vested. All options are initially assumed to vest. Cumulative compensation
cost recognized in pro forma net income or loss with respect to options that are forfeited
prior to vesting is adjusted as a reduction of pro forma compensation expense in the
period of forfeiture. Fair value computations are highly sensitive to the volatility
factor assumed; the greater the volatility, the higher the computed fair value of the
options granted. The total fair value of options
granted was computed to be approximately $71million, $26million, and
$58million, for the years ended June26,2004, June28,2003,
and June29,2002, respectively. The amounts are amortized ratably over the
vesting period of the options. Pro forma stock-based compensation, net of the effect of
forfeitures, was $23million, $22million, and $22million, for the
fiscal years ended June26,2004, June28,2003, and
June29,2002, respectively. The Company has elected to account
for its employee stock plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.

Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities  In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 133
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the
balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. SFAS 133
requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in
earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Special accounting for
qualifying hedges allows a derivatives gains and losses to offset related results on
the hedged item in the income statement, and requires that a company must formally
document, designate, and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge
accounting. The Company has entered into foreign
currency forward contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on firm sale
commitments denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts qualify as fair value
hedges pursuant to SFAS 133. Accordingly, the fair value of the derivative instruments is
recorded on the balance sheet and is offset by changes in the fair value of the related
firm commitments. The ineffective portion of the derivative instruments are recorded
currently in income. There were no hedged transactions at June26,2004 or
June29,2002, however, at June28,2003, the unrealized gain on
hedged transactions was $480,000. Page 51 of 63 Recent Accounting
Standards  In January 2003, FASB issued
Interpretation 46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN
46 requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests in a variable interest
entity to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable
interest investors to provide certain disclosures. A variable interest entity is an entity
in which the equity investors do not have a controlling interest or the equity investment
at risk is insufficient to finance the entitys activities without receiving
additional subordinated financial support from the other parties. FIN 46 was effective for
variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and for older entities in the
first reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. We have not created any variable
interest entities. NOTE 3: SALE OF THE HONG
KONG COATINGS DIVISION DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Effective
September26,2003, the Company sold its coated glass business located in Hong
Kong to NSG for approximately $14million. The assets sold include the right to
direct 50% of the China JV production, customer lists of the business, the coated glass
inventory and any outstanding purchase orders of the coated glass business located in Hong
Kong. Proceeds from the sale of the
business were $747,000 in cash and $600,000 in a promissory note. The note accrues
interest at 5% per annum, is due on September26,2004, and does not have a
prepayment penalty. The Company recorded a $783,000 gain, net of taxes of $415,000 as a
result of this transaction. The Company accounted for the sale of
the Hong Kong coated glass business as a discontinuance of the business. As a result,
certain financial information has been restated to give effect to the classification of
the Hong Kong coated glass business as a discontinued operation. The net revenues of the
discontinued operation were $933,000, $61million and $73million for the
fiscal years ended June 26, 2004, June 28, 2003 and June 29, 2002, respectively. NOTE 4: LONG-TERM DEBT In fiscal year 1998, the Company
entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement the Agreement with a
domestic bank providing for a revolving credit facility Credit Facility with
a maximum availability of $115million. This Agreement expired on
September17,2002, and the Company did not renew the Credit Agreement. Interest expense was $138,000 for the
fiscal year ended June29,2002. NOTE 5: INVESTMENT IN
JOINT VENTURE In June 1998, the Company formed a
50/50 China JV with NSG in China to manufacture, process, sell and export certain types of
thin film coated glass. Each party contributed $32million in cash to the China JV
as equity. During fiscal 2002, 2001 and 1999, the Company sold new and refurbished
equipment to the China JV for use in the process of thin film coating of glass. The sales
prices were approximately $12million, $56million and $51million,
respectively. Because the Company owns 50% of the China JV, the Company recorded 50% of
the revenue and related cost of the sales and has deferred 50% of the gross profit of each
sale, approximately $0, $13million and $14million, respectively, which will
be recognized on a straight-line basis over ten years, consistent with the depreciation
schedule at the China JV and the estimated depreciable life of the equipment. The
amortization of the deferred gross profit is included with Equity earnings of joint
venture in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The China JV began operations during
the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999. The Company records 50% of income or loss from
operations of the China JV after eliminating the impact of inter-entity transactions. The
functional currency for the China JV is the local Chinese Yuan Renminbi. The
Companys investment in the China JV is translated into U.S. dollars using the
period-end exchange rate. The earnings recorded by the Company from the China JV are
translated at average rates prevailing during the period, which have remained fixed by the
Chinese government for a number of years. The cumulative translation gain or loss, if any,
is recorded as Other cumulative comprehensive income loss in the
Companys consolidated financial statements. During the third quarter of fiscal
2004, the China JV entered into an unsecured credit facility that did not require bank
guaranty from either of the parent companies. Subsequently, the Companys guaranty of
50% of the debt of the China JV was released. As of June 28, 2003, the Company had
provided a letter of credit under its commercial loan facility to guarantee approximately
$50 million of the debt of the China JV. Page 52 of 63 In addition, during fiscal years
2004, 2003, and 2002, the Company received cash royalty payments from the China JV
totaling $399,000, $404,000, and $220,000, respectively. The Company recorded sales to the
China JV of $544,000, $783,000 and $459,000 in fiscal years ended June26, 2004,
June28, 2003 and June 29, 2002, respectively. Summarized statement of operations

As of June26,2004, the
Company does not have accounts payable to the Joint Venture. At June28,2003,
the Company had accounts payable to the China JV of approximately $578,000. As of June 26,
2004 and June 28, 2003, the Company had receivables from the China JV of approximately
$273,000, including royalty receivables of $156,000 and $238,000, respectively. NOTE 6: WARRANTS AND
STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS In January 2001, the Company issued
warrants to purchase 75,949 shares of common stock at $2233 per share and
warrants to purchase 17,468 shares at $2009 per share in connection with a Series A
convertable preferred stock offering. The Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock was converted into 506,328 shares of common stock in December 2001. The warrants are
immediately exercisable, and may be exercised any time over a five and three year period,
respectively. The Company determined the fair value of these warrants to be approximately
$733,623 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following weighted average
assumptions:    
Risk-free interest rate

The estimated fair value of these
warrants was recorded in stockholders equity with an offset to the amount attributed
to the Series A convertible preferred stock. These securities also contain certain
registration rights with respect to the underlying shares of common stock. On October17,2003, the
holder of a warrant to purchase 17,468 shares of common stock at a price of $2009 per
share exercised the warrant through a cashless option permitted under the terms of the
warrant. As a result, on October17,2003, the Company issued 5,865 shares in
satisfaction of the warrant and received no payment for the shares. Page 53 of 63 Stock Options  In May 1993, the board of directors
approved the Companys 1993 Stock Option Plan the 1993 Plan covering
276,500 shares of common stock. The exercise price of these options was determined by the
board of directors. The options granted in fiscal years 1994 and 1995 vested over a four
year period and, under its original terms, were not exercisable until after an initial
public offering of common stock was completed by the Company. Accordingly, the Company
accounted for the 1993 Plan as a variable plan until June30,1995, at which
time the board of directors declared that the options then outstanding were exercisable,
subject to their vesting terms. The Company recorded approximately $597,000 of deferred
compensation related to all options, which was equal to the excess of the estimated fair
market value of the common stock as of July1,1995 over the exercise price. As
of July3,1999, all of the compensation has been expensed. In April 1997, the Company adopted
the 1997 Stock Option Plan the 1997 Plan covering 272,500 shares of common
stock, as amended. The exercise price of options granted under the 1997 Plan is determined
by the board of directors based upon estimated fair market value. The options granted are
to vest ratably over four years. In October 1999, the shareholders of the Company approved
an increase of 100,000 shares to the 1997 Plan, increasing the shares available for
granting to 372,500 shares. In October 2000, the shareholders of the Company approved an
increase of 650,000 shares to the 1997 Stock Option Plan, increasing the shares available
to 1,022,500 shares. Options vest 25% one year after the grant date of the option, and 25%
every year after for three years, and expire no later than ten years after the grant date
of the option. On October 22, 2003, the Company
adopted the Long Term Incentive Plan covering 12 million shares of common stock. The Plan
provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
performance shares and other stock-based awards. The exercise price of options granted
under the Long Term Incentive Plan is determined by the board of directors based upon
estimated fair market value. Options vest 25% one year after the grant date of the option,
and 25% every year after for three years and expire no later than ten years after the
grant date of the option. Stock Appreciation Rights SARs
The board of directors may approve the grant of SARS that are related to options
only. A SAR may be granted only at the time of grant of the related option. The SAR
granted will be exercisable only to the extent that a related option is exercisable. The
value of the SAR will be determine by multiplying the difference between the fair market
value of a share of common stock on the date of exercise over the option price by the
number of shares of common stock with respect to which the SAR is exercised. The SAR
exercise may be in cash, in shares of common stock or in some combination of cash and
stock. Restricted Stock Restricted
stock may be issued either alone or in addition to other awards granted under the Plan.
The board of directors will determine the eligible person, the number of shares to be
awarded, the price, the time that each award will be subject to forfeiture, the vesting
schedule and rights to acceleration. The awards can be different per individual receiving
the award. Each restricted stock award must be accepted within 30 days after the award
date by executing an award agreement and paying the price designated. The recipient of the
restricted stock will not be permitted to sell, transfer, pledge, or assign shares awarded
for a certain period of time as determined by the board of directors. Performance Shares Performance
shares may be awarded either alone or in addition to other awards granted under the Plan.
The board of directors shall determine the eligible persons, the time at which performance
shares shall be awarded, the number of performance shares to be awarded and during which
receipt of the performance shares will be deferred. The board of directors may condition
the grant of performance shares upon the achievement of specific business objectives,
measurements of individual, business unit, Company or Subsidiary performance, or such
other factors or criteria as determined. The awards can be different per individual
receiving the award. The recipient of the performance shares will not be permitted to
sell, transfer, pledge, or assign shares awarded for a certain period of time as
determined by the board of directors. Other Stock-Based Awards Other
Stock-Based Awards of common stock may be granted either alone or in addition to other
awards under the Plan. The board of directors will determine whom, the time of such award,
the number of shares to be awarded and all other conditions of the awards. The awards can
be different per individual receiving the award. Outside Directors
Options  In July 2001, the Company amended the
Outside Director Stock Option Plan to cover an aggregate of 124,000 shares of common
stock. The exercise price of the options under this plan is determined based upon the
estimated fair market value. Options under this plan vest 100% one year after the grant
date of the option and expire ten years after the grant date of the option. Page 54 of 63 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan  On September5,1997, the
Board of Directors adopted, and the stockholders subsequently approved, the Applied Films
Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan Purchase Plan as amended in October
2000. The Purchase Plan was amended April17,2002 to institute two six-month
Option Periods each year commencing on the first business day of May and November,
respectively. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase shares of common
stock through payroll deductions. Shares are purchased at 85% of the fair market value of
the lower of the common stock on the date of the beginning of the period or the
Purchase Date. Purchases are priced on the last business day of
April and October, respectively, for the purchases of as many full shares, but not less
than one 1 full share, as may be purchased with the funds in his or her Purchase
Account. Up to 100,000 shares of common stock may be sold under the Purchase Plan. Shares
sold under the Purchase Plan may be newly issued shares or shares acquired by the Company
in the open market. Unless terminated earlier by the Board of Directors, the Purchase Plan
will terminate on September5,2007. The Purchase Plan is intended to qualify as
an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, and will be administered in accordance with the limitations set forth
in Section 423 and the rules and regulations thereunder. During fiscal years 2004, 2003, and
2002, the Company issued shares to employees of 8,457, 14,042, and 8,799, under this plan,
respectively, at a purchase price ranging from $281 to $3850 per share. A total 51,259
shares have been issued under the plan since inception. A summary of the Companys Stock

Page 55 of 63 NOTE 7: INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes
through recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income
tax consequences of events, which have been included in the financial statements or tax
returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to
reverse. Provision has not been made for additional foreign taxes on undistributed
earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and the China JV where such earnings will continue to
be reinvested. Income loss from continuing operations before

As of June 26, 2004, the Company had
net operating losses available to offset future taxable income of approximately
$102million in the United States which expire through 2025 and $366million
in Germany which have an indefinite life. The valuation allowance increased by
approximately $13 million in fiscal 2004 and increased by approximately
$72million in fiscal 2003. As of June 26, 2004, approximately $13million of
the valuation allowance is related to the benefits of stock option deductions, which will
be credited to paid-in-capital when realized. The current year unrealized benefit
generated is approximately $652,000. NOTE 8: EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
PLANS Profit Sharing Plan  In August 1992, the Board of
Directors adopted a profit sharing plan for all non-bonus eligible employees. The amount to be
contributed to the profit sharing pool, subject to the approval of the Companys
board of directors, is generally 15% of operating income excluding any amortization of
intangibles related to acquisitions. With the exception of our employees in Germany, whose
compensation is governed by a company tariff agreement, profit sharing is paid pro rata based on the
total employee base to
employees in cash, quarterly, based on a combination of their length of service with the
Company and their pay level. The Company expensed approximately $327,000, $75,000, and
$77,000, in fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, related to this plan. Pension Plan  Applied Films GmbH Co. KG maintains a noncontributory
defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of Applied Films GmbH Co. KG. Benefits are
based primarily on compensation during a specified period before retirement of a specified
amount for each year of service. The assumed pension liability of $133million is
reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June26,2004,
and is subject to adjustment based upon an assessment of the actuarial value of the
obligation. This plan has no assets as of June26,2004. Page 57 of 63 The following table sets forth the
benefit obligation, the funded status of the pension plan, amounts recognized on the

NOTE 9: SIGNIFICANT
CUSTOMERS During fiscal years 2004, 2003, and
2002, approximately 81%, 70%, and 58%, respectively, of the Companys net revenues
were exported to customers outside of Europe where the Company manufactures its systems.
The Companys ten largest customers accounted for, in the aggregate, approximately
65%, 53%, and 62%, of the Companys net revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively. Revenues from our two largest customers in fiscal 2004, LG International and
AFG Industries, Inc., represented 13% and 12% respectively, of our net revenues for that
year. Revenues from these customers for fiscal 2004, consisted of thin film deposition
equipment and spare parts. The loss of, or a significant reduction in purchases by, one or
more of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the Companys
operating results. Page 58 of 63 The following table represents the

The Companys sales are
typically denominated in Euros. As a result, the Company recognized approximately
$1,340,000, $823,000, and $15,000, of foreign currency exchange rate gain loss on
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the fiscal years ended
June26,2004, June28,2003, and June29,2002,
respectively. The Company has $140million and $84million of its accounts
receivable denominated in Euros, and $222million and $99million of its
accounts payable denominated in Euros as of June26,2004 and June28,
2003, respectively. NOTE 10: LEASES The Company is obligated under
certain non-cancelable operating leases for office, manufacturing and warehouse
facilities, and various equipment. Beginning in April 2002, the Company entered into an
eight-year lease for the Companys manufacturing and administrative location in
Germany. Under this lease, payments are fixed for the entire term of the lease and there
is an option to renew the term for an additional five years. The Company entered into a
lease for the Companys manufacturing and administrative location in Longmont,
Colorado, which commenced on January30,1998; payments were fixed until the
first day of the second lease year, at which time payments increase annually one and
one-half percent plus one-half of the increase in the Consumer Price Index per annum.
Lease payments for the Longmont location have been normalized over the term of the lease.
The initial lease term is 15 years, with two additional five year options to extend. Both
of these facility leases are accounted for as operating leases. In connection with the sale of the
Longmont Coating Division, the Company and Optera, Inc. entered into a sublease pursuant
to which Optera, Inc. is subleasing approximately 40,900 square feet at the Companys
Longmont, Colorado facility, which contains approximately 126,000 square feet. The term of
the sublease began on September24,2002 and will terminate on
March31,2005. Optera, Inc. has the option to renew the sublease for additional
periods of one year each commencing at the expiration of the initial term and continuing
until the expiration or termination of the Companys lease for the Longmont, Colorado
facility. The subtenant also holds a right of first refusal with respect to the assignment
or subleasing of, and holds an option to lease, certain additional space in the Longmont,
Colorado facility. Basic rent under the sublease for the initial term is $252,000
annually. Page 59 of 63 The future minimum payments under the
operating leases are as follows in thousands:    Fiscal Year

was $67million, $66million, and $57million, for fiscal years ended
June26,2004, June28,2003, and June29,2002. During
fiscal 2004, rent expense is net of sublease income of $252,000. NOTE 11: FAIR VALUE OF
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial instruments consist of cash
and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and
notes receivable. Carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and
accounts payable approximate fair value. Investments are reported at fair value.
Management believes differences between fair values and carrying values of notes
receivable would not be materially different because interest rates approximate market
rates for material items. NOTE 12: HELIX
ACQUISITION The Company completed the acquisition
of the In-Line Systems division of Helix Technology, Inc., Taiwan the In-line
Division on June2,2004. The In-line Division produces equipment for the FPD
industry and other industries. The acquisition will allow the Company to expand its
operations to include manufacturing in Asia. The aggregate consideration and costs paid by
the Company was $151 million consisting of $125 million of cash and 80,826 shares of
Applied Films Corporation common stock valued at $2659 per share total value of $215
million, based upon the average of the closing market prices for the three days before and
after, and the day of the close of the transaction, June 2,2004, and $497,000 in
transaction costs. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting. The accounts of this acquisition have
been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements from the acquisition
date. The purchase price was allocated based upon the estimated fair value of the
identifiable assets acquired. The excess of the purchase price over fair value of net
identifiable assets was allocated to goodwill. The $151 million purchase price was
allocated as follows in thousands:    Inventory

Total allocation of purchase price

The Company is currently undergoing
an independent third party valuation of the assets acquired and the purchase price
allocation. The valuation should be completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2005.
Intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over periods of five to
seven years. The in-process research and development charge represents the intangible
value of in-process research and development projects that had not yet reached technical
feasibility. The related technology had no alternative use and requires substantial
additional development by the Company. In-process research and development was charged to
operations during fiscal year 2004. At June 26, 2004, $35 million of the
purchase price is being held in an escrow account pending final settlement and
reconciliation of acquired assets in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement.
The final payment is anticipated to be made by the end of the second quarter of fiscal
year 2005. Page 60 of 63 NOTE 13: QUARTERLY
