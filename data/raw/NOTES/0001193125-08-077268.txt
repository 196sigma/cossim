Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Orange 21 Inc. and Subsidiaries Carlsbad, California We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Orange 21 Inc. a Delaware corporation and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended. We have also audited the financial statement schedule listed at a. These consolidated financial statements and schedule are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Orange 21 Inc.
and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also,
in our opinion, the schedule presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. As discussed in Note 2 of the consolidated
financial statements, the Company restated its 2006 consolidated financial statements. /s/ Mayer Hoffman McCann P.C. San Diego, California April 8, 2008

ORANGE 21 INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1.
Organization and Significant Accounting Policies Description
of Business Orange 21 Inc. the Company was originally formed as a California corporation in 1992. On November29,
2004, upon reincorporation in the State of Delaware, the Company changed its name from SpyOptic, Inc. to Orange21 Inc. and the Board of Directors of the Company approved a 16 to 1 reverse stock split and authorized 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock. All financial data and share data in these consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to this split. The
Company designs, develops, manufactures and distributes high quality and high performance products for the action sports, motor sports and youth lifestyle markets. The Companys current products include sunglasses, snowsport and motocross
goggles and branded accessories. Spy Optic, S.r.l., a wholly owned subsidiary, was incorporated in Italy in July2001. Spy Optic, S.r.l. manages the distribution, sales, customer service and administration for the Companys business
outside of North America. Spy Optic, Inc., a California corporation, was formed on December20, 2004 as a wholly owned subsidiary. In January 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of its primary manufacturer LEM S.r.l. LEM
Note 18. Basis of Presentation The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Significant estimates used in preparing these consolidated financial statements include those assumed in computing allowance for doubtful
accounts receivable, reserve for obsolete inventory, reserve for sales returns, the testing of goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those
estimates. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.The Companys investments, which generally have maturities between three and
twelve months at time of acquisition, are considered short-term and classified as available for sale.Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of corporate obligations such as commercial paper and corporate bonds, but
may also include government agency notes, certificates of deposit, bank time deposits and institutional money market funds.

Less than one year Due in one to five years Due after five years 500 Total  500 At December31, 2006, short-term investments consisted of auction rate securities of
$500,000, which had no unrealized gains or losses at December31, 2006. Auction rate securities, for which the interest rate resets approximately every 7 to 28 days, have been allocated within the contractual maturities table based upon the set
maturity date of the security. During the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company did not record any realized gains or losses on its short-term investments. At December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had no investments that
have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period of 12 months. Restricted Cash At December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had $0 and $728,000, respectively of restricted cash which was held in an escrow account as required in
accordance with the purchase agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired LEM, its manufacturing subsidiary. The escrow account relates to the earn-out provision of the purchase agreement. The escrow account was required to be maintained at a
minimum level of 300,000 Euros through June30, 2007 and was released in October 2007 in conjunction with the final payment. At December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company also had $0 and $10 million, respectively, on deposit to be used as
collateral to secure the line of credit facility. See Note 7. Accounts Receivable, Reserve for Refunds and Returns and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Throughout the year, the Company performs credit evaluations of its customers, and adjusts credit limits based on payment history and
the customers current creditworthiness. The Company continuously monitors its collections and maintains a reserve for estimated credits. The Company reserves for estimated future refunds and returns at the time of shipment based upon
historical data and adjusts reserves as considered necessary. The Company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for anticipated bad debts and refunds. Provisions are made based upon a review of
all significant outstanding invoices and overall quality and age of those invoices not specifically reviewed. In determining the provision for invoices not specifically reviewed, the Company analyzes collection experience, customer credit-worthiness
and current economic trends. If the data used to calculate these allowances does not reflect future ability to collect outstanding receivables, an adjustment in the reserve for refunds may be required. Historically, the Companys losses have
been consistent with estimates, but there can be no assurance that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has experienced in the past. Unforeseen, material financial difficulties experienced by its customers could have an
adverse impact on profits. 
45 Table of Contents
Inventories Inventories consist primarily of raw materials and finished products, including sunglasses, goggles, apparel and accessories, product components such as replacement lenses and purchasing and quality control costs. Inventory items are
carried on the books at the lower of cost or market using the weighted average cost method for LEM and first in first out method for our distribution business. Periodic physical counts of inventory items are conducted to help verify the balance of
inventory. A reserve is maintained for obsolete or slow moving inventory. Products are reserved at certain percentages based on their probability of selling, which is estimated based on current and estimated future customer demands and market
conditions. Long-Lived Assets Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets two to thirty three years using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed on the
straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Gains and losses from the sale or retirement of property and equipment
are charged to operations in the period realized or incurred. Intangible assets consist of trademarks, patents and a customer related
intangible that are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 5 to 83 years. Amortization expense was approximately $141,000 and $50,000 for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Amortization expense related to
intangible assets at December31, 2007 in each of the next five years and beyond is expected to be incurred as follows:  Thousands

Thereafter 25 493 In accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets SFAS No144, the Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable. Under
SFAS No144, the Company estimates the future undiscounted cash flows derived from an asset to assess whether or not a potential impairment exists when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long-lived asset may differ. If
the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss will be recognized, measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. The Company uses its best judgment based on the
most current facts and circumstances surrounding its business when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test, the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of a potentially impaired
asset. Changes in assumptions used could have a significant impact on the Companys assessment of recoverability. Numerous factors, including changes in the Companys business, industry segment or the global economy could significantly
impact managements decision to retain, dispose of or idle certain of its long-lived assets. For the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded impairment charges of approximately $147,000 and $88,000, respectively. See
Note 5, Property and Equipment, for information regarding asset impairment charges recognized by the Company. At December31, 2007 and 2006, no impairment of the intangible assets had occurred and the amortization periods remain appropriate.
46 Table of Contents
Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized but instead is measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that a likely impairment exists. The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two-step
impairment test. The first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of
any impairment loss. The fair value of each reporting unit was determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach, the fair value of a reporting unit is calculated based on the present value of
estimated future cash flows. The present value of estimated future cash flows uses our estimates of profit for the reporting units, driven by assumed market growth rates and assumed market segment share, and estimated costs as well as appropriate
discount rates. These estimates are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying business. Under the market approach, fair value is estimated based on market multiples of earnings for comparable companies and similar
transactions. The Company performed its annual test of goodwill as of October1, 2007, which did not indicate any impairment and thus
the second step was not performed. Determining fair value under the first step of the goodwill impairment test is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions could have a
significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the extent of such charge. Point-of-Purchase Displays 
During June2007, the Companyexpensedapproximately $20 millionthebalance net of accumulated depreciationof
point-of-purchase displays in the U.S. to sales and marketing expense,as a result of transferring ownership of these displays to customers. In addition, in the U.S.,future point-of-purchase displays are no longer capitalized since the
displays are owned by the customers. The costof these displays is currently being charged to sales and marketing expense. Revenue Recognition
The Companys revenue is primarily generated through sales of sunglasses, goggles and apparel, net of returns and discounts.
Revenue is recognized in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Staff Accounting BulletinNo104 SAB104, Revenue Recognition. Under SAB104, revenue from product sales is recognized
when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. These criteria are usually met upon delivery to the Companys carrier, which is also
when the risk of ownership and title passes to the Companys customers. Generally, the Company extends credit to its customers after
performing credit evaluations and does not require collateral. The Companys payment terms generally range from net-30 to net-90, depending on the country or whether it sells directly to retailers in the country or to a distributor. The
Companys distributors are typically set up as prepay accounts; however credit may be extended to certain distributors, usually upon receipt of a letter of credit. Generally, the Companys sales agreements with its customers, including
distributors, do not provide for any rights of return or price protection. However, the Company does approve returns on a case-by-case basis in its sole discretion. The Company records an allowance for estimated returns when revenues are recorded.
The allowance is calculated using historical evidence of actual returns. Historically, actual returns have been within the Companys expectations. If future returns are higher than the Companys estimates, the Companys earnings would
be adversely affected. Advertising The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Total advertising expense was approximately $612,000 and $647,000 for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
47 Table of Contents
Product Warranty The Company warrants its products for one year. The standard warranty requires the Company to replace any product or portion thereof that is deemed a manufacturers defect. The Companys product warranty
accrual reflects managements best estimate of probable liability under its product warranties, and is included in accrued expenses. Management determines the warranty accrual based on historical information. Changes in product warranty accrual for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows:  YearEndedDecember31 2007 2006 Thousands Balance at January1  16 Charged to expense 289 156 Amounts charged to reserve 289 172 Balance at December31   Research and Development The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. We capitalize product molds and tooling and depreciate these costs over the useful life of the asset. Shipping and Handling The Company records shipping
and handling costs charged to customers as revenue and other shipping and handling costs to cost of sales as incurred. Financial Instruments
The Companys financial instruments consist primarily of cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
capital leases and notes payable. These financial instruments are stated at their respective carrying values, which approximate their fair values. Foreign Currency The functional currencies of the Companys wholly owned subsidiaries, Spy Optic S.r.l. and LEM are
their respective local currency. Accordingly, the Company is exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currencies. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of
exchange on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period. Gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive
income loss. Derivatives and Hedging The Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to forecasted product purchases denominated in foreign currencies and transactions of its foreign subsidiaries. As part of
its overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company has used foreign exchange contracts in the form of forward contracts. The Company uses forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges primarily to protect against the foreign exchange risks inherent in its forecasted
purchase of products at prices denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the Company records the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative in
accumulated other comprehensive 
48 Table of Contents
income as a separate component of stockholders equity and subsequently reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the period during which the hedged
transaction is recognized in earnings. The Company reports the effective portion of cash flow hedges in the same financial statement line as the changes in the value of the hedged item. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, the notional amounts of
the Companys foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges were approximately $0 and $5,023,000, respectively. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, a net gain of approximately $11,000 and $355,000, respectively, related to
derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. It is expected that $11,000 will be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months along with the earnings effects of the related
forecasted transactions. Net gains on cash flow hedges included in OCI are as follows:  YearEndedDecember31 2007 2006 Thousands Beginning balance 355 288 Change in net gains 21 623 Net gains losses reclassified into earnings 365 20 Accumulated other comprehensive income 11 355 During the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company did not discontinue any cash
flow hedges for which it was probable that a forecasted transaction would not occur. For foreign currency contracts designated as cash
flow hedges, hedge effectiveness is measured using the spot rate. Changes in the spot-forward differential are excluded from the test of hedge effectiveness and are recorded currently in earnings in the foreign currency transaction gain. The Company
measures effectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the hedged item. Other
derivatives designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS No133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedges SFAS No133 consist primarily of forward contracts the Company uses to hedge foreign currency
balance sheet exposures and interest rate swaps. For derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS No133, the Company recognizes changes in fair value in earnings in the period of change. The Company recognizes the
gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge balance sheet exposures in the foreign currency transaction gain. As
of December31, 2007 and 2006, the notional amounts of the Companys foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments were approximately $0 and $647,000, respectively. As part of the acquisition of LEM in January 2006, the Company acquired an interest rate swap with a notional amount of 10million Euros as of
December31, 2006. The interest rate swap was closed in February 2007 at a loss of approximately 10,000 Euro or $13,000. Foreign
currency derivatives are used only to meet the Companys objectives of minimizing variability in the Companys operating results arising from foreign exchange rate movements which may include derivatives that do not meet the criteria for
hedge accounting. The Company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative purposes. Earnings Loss Per Share Basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing net income or loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings loss per share is calculated by including the additional shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants and 
49 Table of Contents
upon vesting of restricted stock, using the treasury stock method. The following table lists the potentially dilutive equity instruments, each convertible

1,062 Income Taxes In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of
deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future
taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical operating results and projections for the taxable income for the future, management has determined that it is more likely than not that the
deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance, will be realized. Accordingly, we have recorded a valuation allowance for our U.S. operations at December31, 2007 and 2006 of $3,164,000 and $0, respectively. At December31, 2007 and
2006, we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our wholly owned subsidiaries, Spy Optic, S.r.l and LEM.

Royalties The Company has several royalty agreements with third parties which represent agreements that the Company has with several athletes to use them in endorsing or advertising several of its products. Comprehensive Income Loss Comprehensive income
loss represents the results of operations adjusted to reflect all items recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income loss. Total comprehensive loss for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 was $70

received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in
exchange for the awardthe requisite service period. No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. The grant-date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments
is estimated using option-pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Number 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No109 FIN 48. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial
statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on the derecognition, classification, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions.
There has been no material effect on the Companys financial statements as a result of the adoption of FIN 48 as of December31, 2007. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS No. 157, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by
providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. This statement is effective for the Company beginning January1, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS
No157 will have on its financial statements. 
51 Table of Contents
In February2007, the FASB released SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. This Statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective
is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. The
Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of this pronouncement will have on the financial statements. In December 2007, the
FASB issued SFAS No141 Revised, Business Combinations SFASNo141 R, replacing SFASNo. 141, Business Combinations SFASNo. 141. SFASNo. 141 Rretains
the fundamental requirements of SFASNo. 141, broadens its scope by applying the acquisition method to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses, and requires, among other things,
that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date, that liabilities related to contingent consideration be recognized at the acquisition date and remeasured at fair value in each subsequent reporting
period, that acquisition-related costs be expensed as incurred, and that income be recognized if the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred. SFASNo. 141 Ris to be applied
prospectively in financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. We do not expect that the adoption of SFASNo. 141 Rwill have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 2.
Restatement The Company has restated its
consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December31, 2006, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No108 Considering the Effect of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
Financial Statements SAB 108, to correct errors in such consolidated financial statements that would have a material effect on the financial statements for 2007 if not corrected. The restatement adjustments also include the
correction of errors in previous periods which were not initially corrected in their respective years based on materiality. The impact of the restatements on periods prior to January1, 2006 is reflected as an increase of $192,000 to beginning
accumulated deficit, a decrease of $236,000 to inventory and an increase to deferred tax assets of $44,000. The net impact to fiscal year 2006 is a $67,000 increase to net income loss, a decrease of $178,000 to net inventories, an increase of
$57,000 to deferred tax assets and an increase of $4,000 to accrued liabilities.

Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $2,809,000 and $3,949,000 for the years ended
December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December31, 2006 includes approximately $701,000 or $009 per basic and diluted share in depreciation expense as a result of a change in estimated useful lives to two years for
our retail point-of-purchase displays. The effect of this change on depreciation expense for the years ended December31, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 would have been an increase of $626,000, a decrease of $386,000, a decrease of $565,000 and a

Financing Arrangements Credit Facilities 
At December31, 2006, the Company had financing arrangements with Comerica Bank consisting of a line of credit facility with a $50
million limit, a foreign exchange facility and letter of credit accommodations. These arrangements were secured by all of the Companys assets, excluding its intellectual property, and a $10 million collateral cash deposit with Comerica, and
were subject to certain covenants, including several liquidity, debt coverage and minimum equity ratios. The $50 million available line of credit was reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit sub limit of $41 million and 10% of
outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts $09 million sub limit. Borrowings were limited to cover any outstanding letters of credit issued to San Paolo IMI on behalf of LEM 30 million Euros or $39 million at December31, 2006.
The Companys foreign exchange facility allowed for the purchase of currency contracts which were used primarily to hedge foreign
currency exposure. The amount of allowable purchases of such contracts was $90 million. At December31, 2006, net foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding amounted to $57 million, which reduced the amount available under the line of
credit by $570,000. As a result, at December31, 2006, the unused line of credit was approximately $05 million with Comerica Bank. At December31, 2006, the Company was not in compliance with two financial covenants under the financing arrangement with Comerica related to maintaining a minimum tangible net worth and not incurring more than two consecutive
quarterly net losses. On February22, 2007, the Company amended its financing 
57 Table of Contents
arrangements with Comerica, which decreased its letter of credit sub limit to $18 million, decreased its foreign exchange facility limit from $90 million
to $72 million and extended the expiration date to May15, 2007. On February26, 2007, Spy Optic, Inc. entered into a Loan and
Security Agreement Loan Agreement with BFI Business Finance BFI with a maximum borrowing capacity of $50 million, which was subsequently modified on December7, 2007 and February12, 2008 to extend the maximum
borrowing capacity to $80 million and affect certain other changes. Actual borrowing availability under the Loan Agreement is based on eligible trade receivable and inventory levels of Spy Optic Inc. Loans extended pursuant to the Loan Agreement
will bear interest at a rate per annum equal tothe prime rate as reported in the Western Edition of the Wall Street Journal from time to time plus 25% with a minimum monthly interest charge of $2,000. The Company granted BFI a security
interest in all of Spy Optic, Inc.s assets as security for its obligations under the Agreement, except for its copyrights, patents, trademarks, servicemarks and related applications. Additionally, the obligations under the Loan Agreement are
guaranteed by Orange 21 Inc. The Loan Agreement imposes certain covenants on Spy Optic, Inc., including, but not limited to, covenants
requiring the Company to provide certain periodic reports to BFI, inform BFI of certain changes in the business, refrain from incurring additional debt in excess of $100,000 andrefrain from paying dividends. Spy Optic, Inc. also established a
bank account in BFIs name into which collections on accounts receivable and other collateral are deposited the Collateral Account. Pursuant to the deposit control account agreement between Spy Optic, Inc. and BFI with respect to
the Collateral Account, BFI is entitled to sweep all amounts deposited into the Collateral Account and apply the funds to outstanding obligations under the Loan Agreement; provided that BFI is required to distribute to Spy Optic, Inc. any amounts
remaining after payment of all amounts due under the Loan Agreement. To secure its obligations under the guaranty, Orange 21 Inc. granted BFI a blanket security interest in all of its assets, except for its stock in Spy Optic, Inc., which it has
covenanted not to pledge to any other person or entity. The Company was in compliance with the covenants at December31, 2007. The
Company received a loan in the amount of $650,000 upon the execution of the Loan Agreement. These proceeds were used to fully collateralize Comerica Bank for the letter of credit issued by Comerica on behalf of Orange 21 Inc. and LEM to San Paolo
IMI in the amount of 12million Euros. The letter of credit with Comerica expired in May 2007. The collateral of 12million Euros was transferred to an interest bearing account with San Paolo IMI in Italy to serve as collateral for the
LEM San Paolo IMI line of credit. During September 2007 San Paolo released the collateral requirement in conjunction with the reduction of the San Paolo IMI line of credit. At December31, 2007, there were outstanding borrowings of $45 million under the Loan Agreement, bearing an interest rate of 1062% and
availability under this line of $35 million subject to eligible accounts receivable and inventory levels. At December31, 2006, the
Company also had a 22million Euros line of credit in Italy with San Paolo IMI for LEM. During October 2007 the line of credit was reduced to 14million Euros. Borrowing availability is based on eligible accounts receivable and export
orders received at LEM. At December31, 2007, there was approximately 05million Euros available under this line of credit. At December31, 2007 and 2006, outstanding amounts under this line of credit amounted to $13 million and
$30 million, respectively. The interest rate at December31, 2007 was 588%.

Share-Based Compensation In December 2004, the
Board of Directors of the Company adopted, and the stockholders of the Company approved, the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan the Plan. The Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees only, and restricted stock, stock
units, nonqualified options or SARS to employees, consultants and outside directors. The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee who determines the vesting period, exercise price and other details for each award. In April 2007, in
connection with a determination by the Board of Directors to reduce the annual cash compensation paid to the non-employee directors of the Company, the Board of Directors approved an amendment and restatement of the Plan that: 1increases the
number of shares of the Companys Common Stock underlying the non-qualified stock options that are automatically granted to the Companys non-employee directors upon their appointment to the Board of Directors and on an annual basis
thereafter and 2modifies the vesting schedule for the automatic option grants made to non-employee directors upon their initial appointment to the Board of Directors. The amendment and restatement of the Plan was approved by the
Companys stockholders at the annual meeting held on June12, 2007. Prior to the adoption of the Plan, the Company had
periodically granted nonqualified common stock options to certain employees and officers of the Company. These stock options generally vest ratably over a five-year period and expire ratably five years after each vesting date. Generally, the
exercise price of all stock options granted equaled the fair value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant, which resulted in no compensation expense when the stock options were issued. Stock Option Activity  Shares Weighted-AverageExercisePrice

37,500 501 Adoption of SFAS No123R On January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No123R Share-Based Payments SFAS No123R, which
requires the Company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations over the
period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awardthe requisite service period. No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. The
grant-date fair value of employee share options and 
61 Table of Contents
similar instruments is estimated using option-pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments. SFAS No123R eliminates
the use of APB Opinion 25 and the option for pro forma disclosure in accordance with SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No123. SFAS No123R permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of the two following methods: 1a modified
prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on both athe requirements of SFAS No123R for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and bthe
requirements of SFAS No123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No123R that remain unvested on the effective date; and 2a modified retrospective method which includes the
requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits companies to restate prior periods based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures, either afor all
prior periods presented or bprior interim periods of the year of adoption. The Company adopted SFAS No123R using the modified-prospective method and therefore prior periods are not restated. SFAS No123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a cash flow from financing
activities, rather than a cash flow from operating activities as required under previous guidance. This requirement may reduce operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. The adoption of SFAS No123R
did not have a material impact on the Companys cash flows during the year ended December31, 2006. The Company recognized the
following share-based compensation expense during the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 in accordance with SFAS No123R:  Year EndedDecember31 2007 2006 Stock options General and administrative expense 327 103 Stock 51 Restricted stock General and administrative expense 130 36 Selling and marketing 11 16 Research and development 7 6 Total 475 212 Income tax benefit 162 72 Stock-based compensation expense, net of taxes 313 140 Effect of stock-based compensation on net loss per share Basic 004 002 Diluted 004 002

Determining Fair Value under SFAS No123R Valuation and Amortization Method.Consistent with the valuation method used for the disclosure only provisions of SFAS
No123, we are using the Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation model single option approach to calculate the fair value of stock option grants. For options with graded vesting, the option grant is treated as a single award and compensation
cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the entire award. Expected Term.The
expected term of options granted represents the period of time that the option is expected to be outstanding. We estimate the expected term of the option grants based on historical exercise patterns that we believe to be representative of future
behavior as well as other various factors. Expected Volatility.We estimate our volatility using our
historical share price performance over the expected life of the options, which management believes is materially indicative of expectations about expected future volatility. Risk-Free Interest Rate.We use risk-free interest rates in the Black-Scholes option valuation model that are based on U.S.
Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options. Dividend
Rate.We have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, we use an expected dividend yield of zero. Forfeitures.SFAS No123R requires companies to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those
estimates in subsequent reporting periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to
vest. For purposes of calculating pro forma information under SFAS No123 for periods prior to the date of adoption of SFAS No123R, we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No123R
related to forfeitures was not material to our financial statements. The following weighted average assumptions were used to estimate the
fair value of options granted during the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006:  YearendedDecember31 2007 2006 Expected volatility

The reconciliation of computed expected income taxes to effective income tax expense by
applying the federal statutory rate of 34% is as follows:  Year Ending December31 2007 2006 AsRestated Thousands Computed expected tax expense 2,076 3,145 State taxes, net of federal benefit 355 540 Foreign tax expense 251 437 Foreign subsidiary income loss 353 794 Meals and entertainment 28 37 U.S. valuation allowances 3,164 Other, net 87 75 1,452 2,342 The change in the valuation allowance for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 was an
increase of $3,578,000 and $2,115,000, respectively. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities,
projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical operating results and projections for the taxable income for the future, management has determined that it is more likely than
not that the deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance will be realized. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for its U.S. operations at December31, 2007 and 2006 of $3,164,000 and $0, respectively. The Company
has recorded a $1,642,000 and $1,107,000 valuation allowance for its wholly owned subsidiary, Spy Optic, S.r.l. at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company has recorded a $1,519,000 and $1,640,000 valuation allowance for its wholly
owned subsidiary, LEM at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  12.
Employee Benefit Plans In 1998, the Company

Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Under the provisions of the Plan, eligible participants may contribute up to 15% of their annual compensation, not to exceed the maximum legal deferral. The Company is not required to contribute to the Plan
and made no contributions to the Plan during the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006.  13.

Acquisitions On January16, 2006, the
Company completed the acquisition of its primary manufacturer LEM. The total purchase price for LEM was 35million Euros or $42 million in cash, plus a two year earn-out based on LEMs future sales. Under the terms of the earn-out, the
Company was obligated to make quarterly payments based on unit sales, up to a maximum of 14million Euros, through December31, 2007. The maximum amount of additional consideration was earned and paid out as of December31, 2007.
Accordingly, the entire amount has been included in the purchase price allocation. The acquisition of LEM has allowed the Company to control its primary manufacturer and ensure a continued source of supply for the Companys products.
The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting; and, accordingly, the purchased assets and liabilities assumed
were recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition based on internal valuations and third party appraisals. The purchase price allocation for this acquisition resulted in an excess of the purchase price over net tangible
assets acquired of approximately $82 million, of which $02 million was allocated to customer relationships, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 7 years. The remaining $80 million was allocated to
goodwill. An estimate of the fair value of the intangible asset acquired was made using the income approach and the residual earnings method. Significant assumptions used in the residual earnings method included an income tax rate of 3725%, a
target EBIT margin of 13% and a long-term growth rate of 30%. Goodwill arises from the Company being able to control its primary manufacturer. The following table summarizes the total purchase price, estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  Thousands

Other liabilities 1,684 Net assets acquired 6,095 Goodwill at December31, 2007 and 2006 was $97 million and $87 million, respectively. The
change in goodwill represents a difference in foreign exchange spot rates used in translation of LEMs, our Italian subsidiary, books during consolidation in accordance with FAS No52. If the results of LEM from January1, 2006 through January15, 2006 had been included in the Companys results for the year ended
December31, 2006, the amounts would not have had a significant difference to consolidated net sales, net loss or net loss per share.

25 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements
As discussed in Notes 2 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
our management and Audit Committee determined that it was appropriate to restate: iour consolidated financial statements for the year ended December31, 2006 as contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2006;
iithe unaudited quarterly financial data for each of the first three quarters in the fiscal year ended December31, 2007; and iiithe unaudited quarterly financial data for all quarters in the fiscal year ended December31,
2006 as more fully described in Notes 2 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. In reaching this conclusion and in connection with the restatement process, our management and Audit Committee has also determined
that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December31, 2007, as more fully described in this section under Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
and Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and
procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and
iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable
probability that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO
and Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007. In making this assessment, management used the following criteria established
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Commission of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.Based on this evaluation and on the criteria, management has concluded that as of December31,
2007, there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. Description of Material Weaknesses as
of December31, 2007 Management identified the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2007: 
86 Table of Contents An appropriate review of the open purchase orders and goods/services received but not invoiced was not being performed timely or thoroughly at our Italian-based
subsidiary, Spy S.r.l.  A proper search for unrecorded liabilities was not being conducted at our Italian-based subsidiary, Spy S.r.l.  A calculation to determine appropriate inventory costs had not been performed on an accurate or timely basis in both the U.S. and at our Italian-based subsidiary,
Spy S.r.l. The above weaknesses resulted in the restatement of the Companys previously issued financial statements
as presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and adjustments to our fiscal 2007 quarterly unaudited financial statements. This annual
report does not include an attestation report of the Companys registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.Managements report was not subject to attestation by the Companys registered
public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only managements report in this annual report. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have made significant control improvements through multiple initiatives in preparation for the adoption of Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.In addition, in order to remediate our material weaknesses
listed above, we have improved our controls and procedures in our Italian-based subsidiary, Spy S.r.l. as follows:  An analysis and review of certain accrued liabilities, including a review of open purchase orders on a monthly basis to identify goods and services received, but
not invoiced.  A monthly review of the reasonableness of related expense accounts in conjunction with a search for unrecorded liabilities to ensure expenses have been recorded
properly on a timely basis.  We have also improved our controls and processes in both the U.S. and Italy regarding capitalization of inventory costs. We have remediated these material weaknesses subsequent to the fiscal year end. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is irecorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely
manner and iiaccumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO as appropriate, to permit timely decisions regarding our disclosure. These controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving
our objectives.Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December31, 2007, in light of the
material weakness noted above, our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act were not effective at that reasonable assurance level in timely making known to
them material information relating 
87 Table of Contents
to the Company required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses described above, the Company performed additional analyses and other post-closing procedures to ensure the
Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly represent in all material
respects the Companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented.
