$250    $0 a PP arranged for the issuance of a total of $250
million of Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable
Preferred Securities of subsidiary trusts holding solely company
debentures by PP Capital Trust and PP Capital
Trust II, two Delaware statutory business trusts.
These Preferred Securities are supported by a
corresponding amount of junior subordinated deferrable
interest debentures issued by PP to the trusts.
PP owns all of the common securities, representing
the remaining undivided beneficial ownership
interest in the assets of the trusts. The proceeds
derived from the issuance of the Preferred Securities
and the common securities were used by PP Capital
Trust and PP Capital Trust II to acquire $103 million
and $155 million principal amount of Junior Subordinated
Deferrable Interest Debentures, respectively.
PP has guaranteed all of the trusts' obligations
under the Preferred Securities. The proceeds of the sale
of these Preferred Securities were loaned by PP to
PP Resources for the tender offer for PP preferred stock.
b The Preferred Securities are subject to mandatory
redemption, in whole or in part, upon the repayment of the
Subordinated Debentures at maturity or their earlier
redemption. At the option of the Company, the Subordinated
Debentures are redeemable on and after the dates shown
above in whole at any time or in part from time to
time. The amount of Preferred Securities subject to
such mandatory redemption will be equal to the amount of
related Subordinated Debentures maturing or being redeemed.
The redemption price is $25 per security plus
an amount equal to accumulated and unpaid distributions
to the date of redemption. See accompanying Notes to Financial Statements. CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT AT DECEMBER 31,

the 7 1/2% series due in 2003.
d Any registered owner of these bonds has the
right to require PP to redeem such owner
bonds on October 1, 1999 at a price of 100%
of the principal amount.
e In 1997, PP Capital Funding issued two
tranches of Medium-Term Notes. The proceeds
derived from the issuance of these notes were
used to pay down loans made under PP
Resources' revolving credit agreement.
f In 1997, the Indiana County Industrial Development
Authority issued $62 million of Pollution
Control Revenue Bonds. Of this amount, $9 million
relates to PP share of the financing

are explained in the glossary.
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Business and Consolidation As of December 31, 1997, PP Resources was the parent holding 
company of PP, PP Global, PP Spectrum and PP Capital Funding. PP financial condition and results of operations are currently 
the principal factors affecting PP Resources' financial condition and 
results of operations. PP is an operating electric utility serving 
customers in central eastern Pennsylvania. All nonutility operating 
transactions are included in Other Income and Deductions on the 
Consolidated Statements of Income. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PP 
Resources and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. All significant 
intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Less than 50% owned affiliates are accounted for using the equity 
method. These affiliates consist principally of Safe Harbor Water Power 
Corporation and investments held by PP Global.
Reclassification Certain amounts from prior years' financial statements have been 
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Management Estimates These financial statements have been prepared using information 
available including certain information which represents management 
best estimates of existing conditions. Actual results could differ from 
these estimates.
Accounting Records The accounting records for PP, the principal subsidiary of PP 
Resources, are maintained in accordance with the Uniform System of 
Accounts prescribed by the FERC and adopted by the PUC.
Regulation PP prepares its financial statements in accordance with the 
provisions of SFAS 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of 
Regulation. SFAS 71 requires a rate-regulated entity to reflect the 
effects of regulatory decisions in its financial statements. In 
accordance with SFAS 71, PP has deferred certain costs pursuant to the 
rate actions of the PUC and the FERC and is recovering or expects to 
recover such costs in electric rates charged to customers. These 
deferred costs or regulatory assets are enumerated and discussed in 
Note 9. To the extent that PP concludes that recovery of a regulatory 
asset is no longer probable due to regulatory treatment, the effects of 
competition or other factors, the amount would have to be written off 
against income. PP will discontinue application of SFAS 71 for the 
generation portion of its business upon the issuance of the PUC 
restructuring order. See Note 3 for additional information.
Utility Plant Additions to utility plant and replacement of units of property are 
capitalized at cost. The cost of funds used to finance construction 
projects or AFUDC is capitalized as part of construction cost. The cost of units of property retired or replaced is charged to 
accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs of 
property and the cost of replacing items determined to be less than an 
entire unit of property are charged to operating expense. Major classes of electric utility plant in service and their 
respective balances are millions of dollars                1997      1996
Production        $6,305     $6,303
Transmission        392      386
Distribution       2,891     2,774
General           328      303
Other            68       58
$9,984     $9,824 For financial statement purposes, depreciation is being provided 
over the estimated useful lives of property using a straight-line method 
for all property except for certain property at the Susquehanna steam 
station. The other portion of the Susquehanna property is depreciated at 
an annual rate of $173 million from October 1995 through December 1998, 
after which depreciation is scheduled to decline by $71 million annually. 
Provisions for depreciation, as a percent of average depreciable 
property, approximated 38% in 1997 and 1996 and 37% in 1995.
Nuclear Decommissioning and Fuel Disposal An annual provision for PP share of the future cost to 
decommission the Susquehanna station, equal to the amount allowed for 
ratemaking purposes, is charged to operating expense. Such amounts are 
invested in external trust funds which can be used only for future 
decommissioning costs. See Notes 4 and 7. The DOE is responsible for the permanent storage and disposal of 
spent nuclear fuel removed from nuclear reactors. PP pays the DOE a 
fee for future disposal services and recovers such costs in customer 
rates. PP has joined other utilities in a federal lawsuit to suspend 
payments to the DOE and to place the fees in escrow unless that 
department begins accepting nuclear fuel as agreed to in its contract 
with the utilities. Financial Investments Securities subject to the requirements of SFAS 115 Accounting for 
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities are carried at fair 
value, determined at the balance sheet date. Net unrealized gains on 
available-for-sale securities are included in common equity. Net 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in income. 
Net unrealized gains and losses on securities that are not available for 
unrestricted use due to regulatory or legal reasons are reflected in the 
related asset and liability accounts. Realized gains and losses on the 
sale of securities are recognized utilizing the specific cost 
identification method. Investments in financial limited partnerships are 
accounted for under the equity method of accounting and venture capital 
investments are recorded at cost. See Note 8.
Premium on Reacquired Long-Term Debt Premiums paid and expenses incurred by PP to redeem long-term debt 
are deferred and amortized over the life of the new debt issue or the 
remaining life of the retired debt when the redemption is not financed by 
a new issue.
Capital Leases Leased property of PP capitalized on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet is recorded at the present value of future lease payments and is 
amortized so that the total of interest on the lease obligation and 
amortization of the leased property equals the rental expense allowed for 
ratemaking purposes. Future lease payments for nuclear fuel are based on 
the quantity of electricity produced at the Susquehanna Station. The 
maximum amount of nuclear fuel available for lease under current 
arrangements is $200 million. In April 1997, capital leases for vehicles, personal computers, and 
other property were reclassified as operating leases. This 
reclassification resulted from a revised agreement between PP and its 
leasing companies. The new leases did not meet any of the classification 
criteria to be deemed capital leases according to FASB No. 13.
Revenues Electric revenues are recorded based on the amounts of electricity 
delivered to customers through the end of each calendar month. This 
includes amounts customers will be billed for electricity delivered from 
the time meters were last read to the end of the month. During 1997, 
PP ECR and STAS were zero. The SBRCA ended in June 1997. Approximately 97% of operating revenues were derived from electric 
energy sales, with 33% coming from residential customers, 27% from 
commercial customers, 19% from industrial customers, 20% from wholesale 
sales and 1% from others.
Income Taxes PP Resources and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal 
income tax return. Income taxes are allocated to operating expenses and 
other income and deductions on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The provision for PP deferred income taxes is based upon the 
ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by the PUC and FERC. 
The difference in the provision for deferred income taxes and the amount 
that otherwise would be recorded under generally accepted accounting 
principles is deferred and included in taxes recoverable through future 
rates on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 6. Investment tax credits were deferred when utilized and are amortized 
over the average lives of the related property.
Pension Plan and Other Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits PP has a noncontributory pension plan covering substantially all 
employees. Subsidiary companies of PP formerly engaged in coal mining 
have a noncontributory pension plan for substantially all non-bargaining, 
full-time employees. Funding is based upon actuarially determined 
computations that take into account the amount deductible for income tax 
purposes and the minimum contribution required under the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. PP Global has a non-qualified retirement plan for its corporate 
officers. For information on other postretirement and postemployment benefits, 
see Note 13.
Cash Equivalents All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original 
maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. 2. PUC Restructuring Proceeding In December 1996, Pennsylvania enacted the Customer Choice Act to 
restructure its electric utility industry in order to create retail 
access to a competitive market for the generation of electricity. The 
Act includes the following major provisions: 1 all electric utilities 
in Pennsylvania are required to file a restructuring plan with the PUC to 
implement direct access to a competitive market for electric generation; 
2 retail customer choice will be phased in over three years, beginning 
as early as January 1, 1999; 3 electric distribution companies will be 
the suppliers of last resort, and the PUC will ensure that adequate 
generation reserves exist to maintain reliable electric service; 4 
retail rates generally will be capped for at least four-and-a-half years 
for transmission and distribution charges and for as long as nine years 
for generation charges; 5 utilities are permitted to recover PUC-
approved transition or stranded costs through a non-bypassable 
Competitive Transition Charge CTC; and 6 transition bonds may be 
issued to refinance the stranded costs, with a transition charge on 
customers bills to repay the bonds. Under the Customer Choice Act, the PUC is authorized to determine 
the amount of PP stranded costs to be recovered through a CTC to be 
paid by all PUC-jurisdictional customers who receive transmission and 
distribution service from PP Stranded costs are defined in the 
Customer Choice Act as generation-related costs. which would have been 
recoverable under a regulated environment but which may not be 
recoverable in a competitive generation market and which the PUC 
determines will remain following mitigation by the electric utility. In accordance with the Customer Choice Act, PP filed its 
restructuring plan with the PUC on April 1, 1997. PP restructuring 
plan includes a claim of $45 billion on a net present value basis as of 
January 1, 1999 for stranded costs. Pursuant to the Customer Choice 
Act, this claim is comprised of the following categories 1.	Net plant investments and costs attributable to existing 
generation plants and facilities, costs of power purchases, disposal 
costs of spent nuclear fuel, retirement costs attributable to 
existing generating plants and employee-related transition costs 2.	Prudently incurred costs related to the cancellation, 
buyout, buydown or renegotiation of NUG contracts; and 3.	Regulatory assets and other deferred charges typically 
recoverable under current regulatory practice and cost obligations 
under PUC-approved contracts with NUGs. The following are the components of PP stranded cost claim as 
presented in the evidentiary record of the proceeding                      Amount

a Includes deferred income taxes related to generation assets. In determining the appropriate amount of stranded cost recovery, the 
Customer Choice Act requires the PUC to consider the extent to which an 
electric utility has taken steps to mitigate stranded costs by 
appropriate means that are reasonable under the circumstances. 
Mitigation efforts undertaken over time prior to the enactment of the 
Customer Choice Act are to be considered of equal importance by the PUC 
in determining an electric utility stranded costs as actions taken 
after the passage of the Customer Choice Act. In its restructuring plan, 
PP described its extensive efforts to mitigate its stranded costs, 
resulting in a reduction in its stranded cost claim of over $1 billion. Numerous parties have intervened in PP restructuring proceeding. 
These parties are recommending stranded cost recovery by PP ranging 
from $695 million to $32 billion. In this regard, the PUC OTS 
recommends that PP be permitted to recover $32 billion of its stranded 
costs; the PP Industrial Customer Alliance recommends recovery of $695 
million; and the OCA recommends recovery of $11 billion. Under 
Pennsylvania law, the OCA and the OTS have advocacy roles in proceedings 
before the PUC. Testimony filed by the OCA and OTS carries no more 
weight than testimony filed by any other party in the proceeding. Evidentiary hearings in this matter were held in late-August. The 
PUC has revised the procedural schedule several times to permit continued 
settlement discussions among the parties. In February 1998, the parties 
filed their Main Briefs in the proceeding. Under the current schedule, 
the PUC final order is due by June 4, 1998. PP cannot predict the 
ultimate outcome of this proceeding. The ultimate impact of the Customer Choice Act on PP financial 
health will depend on numerous factors, including 1.	The PUC final order in the restructuring proceeding, 
including the amount of stranded cost recovery approved by the PUC and 
the PUC disposition of other issues raised; 2.	The effect of the rate cap imposed under the provisions of the 
Customer Choice Act 3.	The actual market price of electricity over the transition 
period; 4.	Future sales levels; and 5.	The extent to which the regulatory framework established by the 
Customer Choice Act will continue to be applied. Under the Customer Choice Act, PP rates to PUC-jurisdictional 
customers are capped at the level in effect on January 1, 1997 through 
mid-2001 for transmission and distribution services and through the year 
2005 for generation services to customers who do not choose an 
alternative supplier. Applying the CTC proposed in its restructuring 
plan which is restricted by the rate cap through the year 2005, it is 
estimated that PP would collect approximately $4 billion on a net 
present value basis as of January 1, 1999 of its stranded costs. The 
remaining $500 million would be reflected as lower cash flow to PP 
after the transition period than would have occurred with continued 
regulated rates. In this regard, it should be noted that PP stranded cost claim 
included in the restructuring plan is based on a projection of future 
market prices and assumes a significant portion of PP stranded costs 
will be recovered by way of increased market prices for electricity. 
This increase may or may not occur. To the extent that the market price 
of electricity does not increase as projected, or other projections do 
not actually occur, PP could experience a lower recovery of stranded 
costs. If the PUC final order in the restructuring proceeding were to 
permit full recovery of PP stranded costs, including full recovery of 
all regulatory assets and above-market NUG costs over the transition 
period, PP estimates that its net income over the transition period 
would be reduced by about 5% from amounts that were previously projected 
under historic cost-based regulation. However, the PUC final order -- either as a result of a settlement 
or a fully-litigated proceeding -- may result in changes to components or 
assumptions in PP restructuring plan that could have an adverse 
effect on the amount of the CTC, the amount of stranded costs that are 
recoverable through the CTC or the overall amount of revenues to be 
collected from customers. As a result of these uncertainties, PP 
cannot determine whether and to what extent it may be subject to a write-
off or a reduction in revenues and earnings with respect to the 
restructuring proceeding. Based on the substantial amounts involved in 
the restructuring proceeding, should PP incur such a write-off or 
reduction in revenues and earnings, either one could be material in 
amount. Accordingly, PP Resources is unable to predict the ultimate 
effect of the Customer Choice Act or the PUC final order in the 
restructuring proceeding on its financial position, its results of 
operation, future PP rate levels, the need or ability to issue 
securities to meet future capital requirements or the ability to maintain 
the common stock dividend at the current level. The Customer Choice Act permits the issuance of transition bonds 
securitized by customer revenues from an Intangible Transition Charge 
ITC to finance the payment of stranded costs. PP is considering 
whether to seek to securitize some portion of its stranded cost claim, 
which would require the approval of the PUC in a qualified rate order. Certain parties have brought actions in the Pennsylvania 
Commonwealth Court challenging the constitutionality of the Customer 
Choice Act. PP has intervened in these proceedings in support of the 
Customer Choice Act. 3. Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation The FASB Emerging Issues Task Force EITF has addressed the 
appropriateness of the continued application of SFAS 71 by utilities in 
states that have enacted restructuring legislation similar to the 
Customer Choice Act. The EITF issued its statement 97-4 Deregulation of 
the Pricing of Electricity -- Issues Related to the Application of FASB 
Statements 71 and 101, which concluded that utilities should discontinue 
application of SFAS 71 for the generation portion of their business when 
a deregulation plan is in place and its terms are known. For PP, this 
will be upon the issuance of the PUC restructuring order expected to be 
no later than mid-1998. One of the EITF key conclusions is that 
utilities should continue to carry some or all of their regulatory assets 
and liabilities that originated in the generation portion of the business 
if the regulatory cash flows to realize and settle them will be derived 
from the regulated portion of the business e.g., transmission and 
distribution. In addition, costs or obligations of the generation 
portion of the business that are incurred after application of SFAS 71 
ceases and that are covered by the regulated cash flows for the portion 
of the business that remains regulated on a cost of service basis would 
also meet the criteria to be considered regulatory assets or liabilities.
PUC Proceedings The Customer Choice Act establishes a definitive process for 
transition to market-based pricing for electric generation. This 
transition effectively includes cost-of-service based ratemaking during 
the transition period, subject to a rate cap. Rates will include a non-
bypassable CTC, which is designed to give utilities the opportunity to 
recover their stranded costs during the transition period. Given the current regulatory environment, PP electric 
transmission and distribution businesses are expected to remain regulated 
on a cost-of-service basis and, as a result, the provisions of SFAS 71 
should continue to apply to those businesses. The impact of the 
discontinuance of application of SFAS 71 to the generation portion of 
PP business will depend to a large degree on the outcome of the 
restructuring proceeding currently pending before the PUC. See Financial 
Note 2 for a discussion of the potential financial impacts of that 
proceeding.
FERC Proceedings Under FERC Order 888, 16 small utilities which have power supply 
agreements with PP signed before July 11, 1994, requested and were 
provided with PP current estimate of its stranded costs applicable to 
these customers if they were to terminate their agreements in 1999. PP 
has now executed settlement agreements with these customers, which will 
be filed with the FERC for approval. These settlement agreements provide 
for continued power supply by PP through January 2004. If FERC 
approves the agreements as filed, PP would be required to write off a 
portion of its stranded costs applicable to these customers. The amount 
of this write-off is currently estimated at approximately $28 million 
after-tax, or 17 cents per share of common stock. FERC action on this 
matter is not expected until the second quarter of 1998. 4. Rate Matters
Base Rate Filing with the PUC In 1995, the PUC issued a final order with respect to the base rate 
case filed by PP in December 1994. The PUC Decision increased PUC 
jurisdictional rates by about $85 million annually, or 38%. The PUC 
Decision permitted the levelization of depreciation expense for the 
Susquehanna station, recovery of retiree health care costs and costs of 
the 1994 voluntary early retirement program and revised costs to 
decommission Susquehanna SES. The order also permitted recovery of 
deferred operating and capital costs, net of energy savings, for 
Susquehanna Unit 2 but disallowed similar costs for Unit 1. The PUC also 
rejected PP request to include in the ECR the cost of capacity billed 
to other utilities after the contractual arrangements with these 
utilities expire.  The OCA appealed three issues from the PUC Decision to the 
Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court. In May 1997, the Commonwealth Court 
issued its decision on the OCA appeal. Two of the issues, recovery of 
SFAS 106 deferrals and the carrying charges and operating expenses for 
Susquehanna Unit 2 from commercial operation until the plant was 
recognized in rates, were decided in PP favor. The third issue was 
the recovery of Pennsylvania Gross Receipts Tax GRT on uncollectible 
revenues. PP had requested an allowance for GRT on the full amount of 
revenue approved by the PUC, while the OCA had proposed a $745,000 
annualized adjustment to disallow GRT on revenues that PP will not be 
able to collect. The PUC had rejected the OCA proposed adjustment. 
The Commonwealth Court reversed the PUC Decision and remanded that issue 
to the PUC for adjustment of the allowance.
FERC - Major Utility Rates In January 1996, PP filed a request with the FERC to incorporate a 
change in the method of calculating depreciation under its contracts with 
four major electric utility customers Atlantic, BG, JCP, and UGI. 
PP also sought to increase the charges to those customers for nuclear 
decommissioning costs. A settlement of this case was approved by the 
FERC in June 1997, under terms which have no material effect on PP 5. Sales to Other Electric Utilities PP provides Atlantic with 125,000 kilowatts of capacity summer 
rating and related energy from its wholly owned coal-fired stations. 
Sales to Atlantic will expire in March 1998. PP provided JCP with 567,000 kilowatts of capacity and related 
energy from all of its generating units during 1997. This amount will 
decline by 189,000 kilowatts per year until the end of the agreement on 
December 31, 1999. PP expects to be able to resell the capacity and 
energy at market prices. PP provides BG with 129,000 kilowatts or 66 percent of its 
share of capacity and related energy from the Susquehanna station. Sales 
to BG will continue through May 2001. In June 1997, PP began a sale of capacity and energy to JCP 
pursuant to an agreement which provides that JCP will purchase 150,000 
kilowatts of capacity and energy for 12 months, increasing to 200,000 
kilowatts in June 1998, and then to 300,000 kilowatts in June 1999 
through the end of the agreement in May 2004. Prices for this energy and 
capacity reflect market conditions. In July 1997, FERC accepted a new wholesale power tariff that 
permits PP to sell capacity and energy at market-based rates, both 
inside and outside the PJM area, subject to certain conditions. This 
tariff allows PP to become more active in the wholesale market with 
utilities and other entities, and removes pricing restrictions which in 
the past had limited PP to charging at or below cost-based rates. 
Sales of capacity and energy have been made under this new tariff. In January 1998, the United States Department of Energy approved 
PP application for an export license to sell capacity and/or energy 
to electric utilities in Canada. This export license allows PP to sell 
either its own capacity and energy not required to serve domestic 
obligations or power purchased from other utilities. 6. Income Taxes For 1997, 1996 and 1995, the corporate federal income tax rate was 
35%, and the Pa. CNI rate was 999%. The tax effects of significant temporary differences comprising PP 
Resources' net deferred income tax liability were as follows millions of

Susquehanna station was completed in 1993 and was a site-specific study, 
based on immediate dismantlement and decommissioning of each unit 
following final shutdown. The study indicates that PP 90% share of 
the total estimated cost of decommissioning the Susquehanna station is 
approximately $724 million in 1993 dollars. The estimated cost includes 
decommissioning the radiological portions of the station and the cost of 
removal of nonradiological structures and materials. The operating 
licenses for Units 1 and 2 expire in 2022 and 2024, respectively. Decommissioning costs charged to operating expense were $12 million 
in both 1997 and 1996 and $8 million in 1995 and are based upon amounts 
included in customer rates. The increase in 1996 is a result of the PUC 
Decision, in which recovery of decommissioning costs was based on the 
cost estimates in the 1993 site-specific study. Rates charged to small 
utilities reflect the estimated cost of decommissioning in the 1993 
study. In January 1996, PP filed with the FERC to increase its 
decommissioning rate to reflect the projected cost of decommissioning the 
Susquehanna station. A settlement of this case was approved by the FERC 
in June 1997. See Note 4 for further information. Amounts collected from customers for decommissioning, less 
applicable taxes, are deposited in external trust funds for investment 
and can be used only for future decommissioning costs. The market value 
of securities held and accrued income in the trust funds at December 31, 
1997 and 1996 aggregated approximately $163 million and $128 million, 
respectively. The trust funds experienced, on a fair market value basis, 
a $24 million net gain in 1997, which includes net unrealized 
appreciation of $18 million, and a net gain in 1996 of $6 million, which 
includes net unrealized appreciation of $2 million. The trust fund 
activity is reflected in the nuclear plant decommissioning trust fund and 
in other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
Accrued nuclear decommissioning costs were $166 million and $130 million 
at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The FASB issued an exposure draft on the accounting for liabilities 
related to closure and removal of long-lived assets, including 
decommissioning of nuclear power plants. As a result, current industry 
accounting practices for decommissioning may change, including the 
possibility that the estimated cost for decommissioning could be recorded 
as a liability at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows 
that will be required to satisfy those obligations. Due to FASB 
recognition that these issues intertwine with other unresolved accounting 
issues, FASB has not yet determined when it will issue another exposure 
draft or a final statement. 8. Financial Instruments The carrying amount shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the 
estimated fair value of PP Resources' financial instruments are as

$1,359   $1,399 As of December 31, 1997, substantially all of PP regulatory 
assets are being recovered through rates charged to customers over 
periods ranging from 3 to 35 years. In December 1996, Pennsylvania 
passed restructuring legislation which permits utilities to recover 
approved regulatory assets as transition or stranded costs. See Note 2 
PUC Restructuring Proceeding. For a discussion of taxes recoverable through future rates, 
postretirement benefits other than pensions, assessment for 
decommissioning uranium enrichment facilities, VERP, and additional 
information on the PUC Decision, see Notes 4, 6, and 13. 10. Credit Arrangements & Financing Activities PP issues commercial paper and, from time to time, borrows from 
banks to provide short-term funds required for general corporate 
purposes. In addition, certain subsidiaries also borrow from banks to 
obtain short-term funds. Bank borrowings generally bear interest at 
rates negotiated at the time of the borrowing. PP weighted average 
interest rate on short-term borrowings was 66% and 49% at December 31, 
1997 and 1996, respectively. PP currently has authorization from the 
FERC to issue up to $750 million of short-term debt. In April 1997, PP redeemed $210 million principal amount of four 
series of first mortgage bonds. Three of the series of first mortgage 
bonds were redeemed under the maintenance and replacement fund provisions 
of the mortgage. These series of bonds consisted of $40 million 
principal amount of the 7% series due 1999; $60 million principal 
amount of the 7-1/4% series due 2001; and $80 million principal amount 
of the 7-1/2% series due 2003. The fourth series, $30 million principal 
amount of the 6-3/4% series due 1997, was redeemed under the optional 
redemption provisions of that series. In April 1997, PP instituted a short-term bond program in order to 
meet certain short-term working capital requirements and to accomplish 
other corporate purposes. Under this program, a total of $800 million of 
short-term bonds having maturities not in excess of 30 days were issued 
from time to time, with no more than $150 million of such bonds 
outstanding at any one time. No such bonds were outstanding at December 
31, 1997. In March and April 1997, PP Resources acquired 7910% $369 
million par value of the outstanding preferred stock of PP in a tender 
offer. By obtaining a majority of the 4-1/2% Preferred Stock and a 
majority of the combined amount of the 4-1/2% Preferred Stock and Series 
Preferred Stock collectively, the Preferred Stock, PP Resources will 
be able to waive certain restrictive provisions contained in PP 
Articles of Incorporation, including limitations on PP ability to 
increase the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock, merge or 
consolidate with other corporations, and issue additional Preferred Stock 
and unsecured debt. To provide financing for a portion of this tender offer, PP 
arranged for the issuance of a total of $250 million of Company-
obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary 
trusts holding solely company debentures Preferred Securities by two 
Delaware statutory business trusts. These securities consist of four 
million shares of 820% Preferred Securities issued by PP Capital Trust 
to the public in April 1997 at $25 per share, for proceeds of $100 
million; and six million shares of 810% Preferred Securities issued by 
PP Capital Trust II to the public in June 1997 at $25 per share, for 
proceeds of $150 million. PP owns all of the common securities of both 
trusts. The sole asset of PP Capital Trust is $103 million of PP 
820% junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures Junior 
Subordinated Debentures, due April 1, 2027, and the sole asset of PP 
Capital Trust II is $155 million of PP 810% Junior Subordinated 
Debentures, due July 1, 2027. The obligations of PP under the Junior 
Subordinated Debentures, the indenture under which the Junior 
Subordinated Debentures were issued, the trust agreements of the trusts 
and the guarantees by PP of payment of the Preferred Securities, in the 
aggregate, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by PP of each 
trust Preferred Securities. PP Capital Funding, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PP Resources, 
was formed in September 1997 to provide financing for PP Resources and 
its subsidiaries. The payment of principal, interest and premium, if 
any, with respect to debt securities issued by PP Capital Funding will 
be guaranteed by PP Resources. In November 1997, PP and PP Capital Funding established a new 
joint revolving credit facility with a group of 14 banks comprised of two 
separate revolving credit agreements -- a $150 million 364-day revolving 
credit agreement and a $300 million five-year revolving credit agreement. 
Under the terms of these credit agreements, either company can borrow at 
interest rates based on Eurodollar deposit rates or the prime rate, and 
the respective obligations of each company are several and not joint. 
The new revolving credit facility replaced PP Resources' $300 million 
revolving credit agreement, PP $250 million revolving credit 
agreement and three separate PP credit agreements totaling $45 million, 
all of which were terminated. At December 31, 1997, PP had no 
borrowings outstanding under the new revolving credit agreements, and 
PP Capital Funding had $90 million of borrowings outstanding under the 
five-year revolving credit agreement. PP Capital Funding has registered $400 million of debt securities 
with the SEC. It is expected that these debt securities will be issued 
from time to time as medium-term notes to provide long-term debt 
financing for PP Resources and its unregulated subsidiaries. In this 
regard, in November 1997 PP Capital sold $100 million of medium-term 
notes having a seven-year term and $2 million of medium-term notes having 
a ten-year term. The proceeds from these sales of medium-term notes were 
used to repay bank borrowings incurred by PP Resources under its prior 
revolving credit agreement that had been used to provide interim 
financing for the capital needs of PP Global. PP leases its nuclear fuel from a trust. The maximum financing 
capacity of the trust under existing credit arrangements is $200 million. 11. Windfall Profits Tax - PP Global In July 1997, the U.K. assessed a windfall profits tax on privatized 
utilities. The tax is payable in two equal installments; the first 
installment was made on December 1, 1997 and the second one is due in 
December 1998. SWEB windfall profits tax was approximately 90 million 
pounds sterling, or about $148 million. Based on PP Global 25% 
ownership interest in SWEB, PP Resources incurred a one-time charge 
against earnings of $37 million, or 23 cents per share, in 1997. 12. Acquisitions of Penn Fuel Gas, Inc. and H.T. Lyons, Inc. In June 1997, PP Resources entered into an agreement with Penn 
Fuel Gas, Inc. PFG, a Pennsylvania corporation, pursuant to which PP 
Resources would acquire PFG. PFG, with nearly 100,000 customers in 
Pennsylvania and a few hundred customers in Maryland, distributes and 
stores natural gas and sells propane. Under the terms of the agreement, PFG would become a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of PP Resources. Upon consummation of the acquisition, each 
outstanding PFG common share would be converted into the right to receive 
between 6968 and 8516 shares of PP Resources' Common Stock, and each 
outstanding PFG preferred share would be converted into the right to 
receive between 0682 and 0833 shares of PP Resources' Common Stock. 
PP Resources expects to issue shares of its Common Stock valued at 
about $121 million to complete the transaction. The exact conversion 
rate and number of PP Resources' shares to be issued will be based on 
the market value of the Common Stock of PP Resources at the time of the 
merger. The transaction is expected to be treated as a pooling-of-
interests for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The acquisition of PFG is subject to several conditions, including 
the receipt of required approvals by the PUC and the SEC. The Maryland 
Public Service Commission has determined not to institute proceedings on 
the matter. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade 
Commission have granted early termination of the required waiting period 
for the acquisition under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Premerger Notification 
Act. In October 1997, PFG shareholders approved the acquisition at a 
special shareholders meeting. The acquisition does not require the 
approval of PP Resources' shareholders. The acquisition is expected to 
be completed by mid-1998. In the third quarter of 1997, PP Resources recorded one-time, non-
payroll related transaction costs associated with the acquisition of PFG 
of $6 million, which reduced earnings by about three cents per share. 
Additional charges may be incurred in connection with closing on this 
transaction, which are not expected to be material in amount. On January 22, 1998, PP Resources acquired H.T. Lyons, a heating, 
ventilating and air-conditioning firm in a cash transaction for an amount 
that is not material. 13. Pension Plan and Other Postretirement and 
Postemployment Benefits
Pension Plan PP has a funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plan 
covering substantially all employees. Benefits are based upon a 
participant earnings and length of participation in the Plan, subject 
to meeting certain minimum requirements. PP has an unfunded supplemental retirement plan for certain 
management employees. A similar plan for directors was terminated 
December 31, 1996. Benefit payments pursuant to these supplemental plans 
are made directly by PP At December 31, 1997, the projected benefit 
obligation of these supplemental plans was approximately $23 million. 
PP Global has established, effective December 1, 1994, a non-qualified 
retirement plan for its corporate officers. The cost of the plan was 
immaterial in 1997. The components of PP net periodic pension cost for the three 
plans were millions of dollars                     1997     1996     1995

Net periodic pension cost       $ 8      $ 15     $ 11 The net periodic pension cost charged to operating expenses was $5 
million in 1997, $9 million in 1996 and $6 million in 1995. The balance 
was charged to construction and other accounts. The funded status of 
PP Plan was millions of dollars                            December 31

present value of projected benefit obligations was 675% and 70% on 
December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The rate of increase in future 
compensation used in determining the actuarial present value of projected 
benefit obligations was 50% on December 31, 1997 and 1996. The assumed 
long-term rates of return on assets used in determining pension cost in 
1997 and 1996 was 80%. Plan assets consist primarily of common stocks, 
government and corporate bonds and temporary cash investments. PP subsidiaries formerly engaged in coal mining have a 
noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all 
non-bargaining unit, full-time employees, which is fully funded, 
primarily by group annuity contracts with insurance companies. This plan 
was amended to freeze benefit increases effective June 1996. In 
addition, the companies are liable under federal and state laws to pay 
black lung benefits to claimants and dependents with respect to approved 
claims, and are members of a trust which was established to facilitate 
payment of such liabilities. Such costs were not material in 1997, 1996 
and 1995.
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions Substantially all employees of PP and its subsidiaries will become 
eligible for certain health care and life insurance benefits upon 
retirement. PP sponsors four health and welfare benefit plans that 
cover substantially all management and bargaining unit employees upon 
retirement. One plan provides for retiree health care benefits to 
certain management employees, another plan provides retiree health care 
benefits to bargaining unit employees, a third plan provides retiree life 
insurance benefits to certain management employees up to a specified 
amount and a fourth plan provides retiree life insurance benefits to 
bargaining unit employees. Dollar limits have been established for the amount PP will 
contribute annually toward the cost of retiree health care for employees 
retiring after March 1993. The PUC Decision in 1995 permitted recovery of the PUC-
jurisdictional amount of retiree health care costs resulting from the 
adoption of SFAS 106. In addition, the PUC Decision permitted PP to 
recover, over a period of about 17 years, the amount of SFAS 106 costs 
that would have been deferred from January 1, 1993 through September 30, 
1995, pursuant to a PUC order but for a Commonwealth Court decision that 
PP could not recover these deferred costs. As a result of the PUC 
Decision, which provided for recovery of $27 million of previously 
expensed SFAS 106 costs, PP recorded a $16 million after-tax credit to 
income in the third quarter of 1995. In December 1993, PP established a separate VEBA for each of the 
four health and welfare benefit plans for retirees. After making initial 
contributions, additional funding of the trusts was deferred pending 
resolution of PP ability to recover the costs of the plans in rates. 
Continued funding of these trusts was subject to the resolution of the 
OCA appeal of the PUC Decision. In 1997, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court 
ruled that the Commonwealth Court decision to uphold the PUC Decision 
is now final. In December 1997, PP contributed an additional $31 
million to these VEBAs. The following table sets forth the plans' combined funded status 
reconciled with the amount shown on PP Resources' Consolidated Balance 
Sheet as of December 31 millions of dollars                            1997    1996

Net periodic postretirement 
benefit cost              $29     $27      $26 Retiree health and benefits costs charged to operating expenses were 
approximately $23 million in 1997, $20 million in 1996, and a net credit 
of approximately $17 million in 1995 reflecting both a $32 million 
credit due to the PUC Decision and costs applicable to contractual 
agreements with other major utilities. Costs in excess of the amount 
charged to expense were charged to construction and other accounts. For measurement purposes, an 8% annual rate of increase in the per 
capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 1998; the 
rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 6% by 2006 and remain at that 
level thereafter. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by 
1% in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit 
obligation as of December 31, 1997, by about $11 million and the 
aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic 
postretirement benefit cost for the year then ended by about $1 million. In determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, 
the weighted average discount rate used was 675% and 70% on December 
31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The trusts that are holding the plan 
assets, except for retiree health care benefits to certain management 
employees, are tax-exempt. The expected long-term rate of return on plan 
assets for the tax-exempt trusts was 65% on December 31, 1997 and 1996. PP and its subsidiaries formerly engaged in coal mining accrued an 
additional liability for the cost of health care of retired miners 
previously employed by them. The liability, based on the present value 
of future benefits, was estimated at $51 million and $54 million as of 
December 1997 and 1996, respectively. In December 1997, PP contributed 
$25 million to a VEBA to partially fund these health care costs.
Postemployment Benefits PP provides health and life insurance benefits to disabled 
employees and income benefits to eligible spouses of deceased employees. 
Postemployment benefits charged to operating expenses were not material. 14. Jointly Owned Facilities At December 31, 1997, PP or its subsidiary owned undivided 
interests in the following facilities millions of dollars                                 Merrill
Generating Stations   Creek
Susquehanna Keystone Conemaugh Reservoir
Ownership interest        9000%   1234%  1139%   837%

Accumulated depreciation     1,160     37     40     9
Construction work in progress    67     1      Each participant in these facilities provides its own financing. 
PP receives a portion of the total output of the generating stations 
equal to its percentage ownership. PP share of fuel and other 
operating costs associated with the stations is reflected on the PP 
Consolidated Statement of Income. In December 1997, Allegheny Electric 
Cooperative, Inc. issued a Request for Proposals for the sale of its 
assets, including its 10% interest in Susquehanna. This proposed sale is 
still pending. The Merrill Creek Reservoir provides water during periods 
of low river flow to replace water from the Delaware River used by PP 
and other utilities in the production of electricity. 15. Subsidiary Coal Reserves In November 1995, PP sold the coal reserves of one of its 
subsidiaries for $52 million, which resulted in a $42 million gain, or 
$20 million after-tax. PP had acquired the reserves in 1974 with the 
intention of supplying future coal-fired generating stations, but later 
concluded that it would not develop these reserves for such purposes. In 
1994, the reserves' carrying value was written down from $84 million to 
$10 million. 16. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
Construction Expenditures PP construction expenditures for the period 1998-2002 are 
estimated to aggregate $13 billion, including AFUDC. For discussion 
pertaining to construction expenditures, see Review of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations under the caption Financial 
Condition -- Capital Expenditure Requirements on page 32.
Nuclear Insurance PP is a member of certain insurance programs which provide 
coverage for property damage to members' nuclear generating stations. 
Facilities at the Susquehanna station are insured against property damage 
losses up to $275 billion under these programs. PP is also a member 
of an insurance program which provides insurance coverage for the cost of 
replacement power during prolonged outages of nuclear units caused by 
certain specified conditions. Under the property and replacement power 
insurance programs, PP could be assessed retroactive premiums in the 
event of the insurers' adverse loss experience. The maximum amount PP 
could be assessed under these programs at December 31, 1997 was about $31 
million. PP public liability for claims resulting from a nuclear incident 
at the Susquehanna station is limited to about $89 billion under 
provisions of The Price Anderson Amendments Act of 1988. PP is 
protected against this liability by a combination of commercial insurance 
and an industry assessment program. In the event of a nuclear incident 
at any of the reactors covered by The Price Anderson Amendments Act of 
1988, PP could be assessed up to $151 million per incident, payable at 
a rate of $20 million per year, plus an additional 5% surcharge, if 
applicable.
Environmental Matters Air The Clean Air Act deals, in part, with acid rain, attainment of 
federal ambient ozone standards and toxic air emissions. PP has 
complied with the Phase I acid rain provisions required to be implemented 
by 1995 by installing continuous emission monitors on all units, burning 
lower sulfur coal and installing low nitrogen oxide burners on certain 
units. To comply with the year 2000 acid rain provisions, PP plans to 
purchase lower sulfur coal and use banked or purchased emission 
allowances instead of installing FGD on its wholly-owned units. PP has met the initial ambient ozone requirements of the Clean Air 
Act by reducing nitrogen oxide emissions by 40% through the use of low 
nitrogen oxide burners. Further seasonal i.e., 5 month nitrogen oxide 
reductions to 55% and 75% of 1990 levels for 1999 and 2003, respectively, 
are specified under the Northeast Ozone Transport Region Memorandum of 
Understanding. The PA DEP has finalized regulations which require PP 
to reduce its ozone seasonal NOx by 57% beginning in 1999. The EPA has finalized new national standards for ambient levels of 
ground-level ozone and fine particulates. Based in part on the new ozone 
standard, the EPA has proposed NOx emission limits for 22 states, 
including Pennsylvania, which in effect requires approximately an 80% 
reduction from the 1990 level in Pennsylvania in the 2005-2012 timeframe. 
The new particulates standard may require further reductions in both NOx 
and SO2 and may extend the reductions from seasonal to year round.  The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to study the health effects of 
hazardous air emissions from power plants and other sources. Depending 
on the outcome of these studies, PP may be required to take additional 
action. Expenditures to meet the 2000 acid rain and 1999 NOx reduction 
requirements are included in the table of projected construction 
expenditures in the section Financial Condition - Capital Expenditure 
Requirements in the Review of the Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations. PP currently estimates that additional capital expen-
ditures and operating costs for environmental compliance under the Clean 
Air Act will be incurred beyond 2002 in amounts which are not now 
determinable but which could be material. Water and Residual Waste DEP residual waste regulations set forth requirements for existing 
ash basins at PP coal-fired generating stations. Any new ash 
disposal facility must meet the rigid siting and design standards set 
forth in the regulations. To address these DEP regulations, PP has 
installed dry fly ash handling systems at most of its power stations, 
which eliminate the need for ash basins. In other cases, PP has 
modified the existing facilities to allow continued operation of the ash 
basins under a new DEP permit. Any groundwater contamination caused by 
the basins must also be addressed. Groundwater degradation related to fuel oil leakage from underground 
facilities and seepage from coal refuse disposal areas and coal storage 
piles has been identified at several PP generating stations. Remedial 
work is substantially completed at two generating stations.  At this 
time, the only other remedial work being planned is to abate a localized 
groundwater degradation problem at Montour. The recently issued final NPDES permit for the Montour station 
contains stringent limits for iron and chlorine discharges. Depending on 
the results of a toxic reduction study to be conducted, additional water 
treatment facilities or operational changes may be needed at this 
station. Capital expenditures through the year 2002 to comply with the 
residual waste regulations, correct groundwater degradation at fossil-
fueled generating stations, and address waste water control at PP 
facilities are included in the table of construction expenditures in the 
section Financial Condition - Capital Expenditure Requirements in the 
Review of the Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In this 
regard, PP currently estimates that $65 million of additional capital 
expenditures may be required in the next four years to close some of the 
ash basins and address other ash basin issues at various generating 
plants. Additional capital expenditures could be required beyond the 
year 2002 in amounts which are not now determinable but which could be 
material. Actions taken to correct groundwater degradation, to comply 
with the DEP regulations and to address waste water control are also 
expected to result in increased operating costs in amounts which are not 
now determinable but which could be material. Superfund and Other Remediation In 1995, PP entered into a consent order with the DEP to address a 
number of sites where PP may be liable for remediation of 
contamination. This may include potential PCB contamination at certain 
PP substations and pole sites; potential contamination at a number of 
coal gas manufacturing facilities formerly owned and operated by PP 
and oil or other contamination which may exist at some of PP former 
generating facilities. As of December 31, 1997, PP has completed work 
on nearly half of the sites included in the agreement. At December 31, 1997, PP had accrued $81 million, representing 
the amount PP can reasonably estimate it will have to spend to 
remediate sites involving the removal of hazardous or toxic substances 
including those covered by the consent order mentioned above. Future 
cleanup or remediation work at sites currently under review, or at sites 
not currently identified, may result in material additional operating 
costs which PP cannot estimate at this time. In addition, certain 
federal and state statutes, including Superfund and the Pennsylvania 
Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act, empower certain governmental agencies, such 
as the EPA and the DEP, to seek compensation from the responsible parties 
for the lost value of damaged natural resources. The EPA and the DEP may 
file such compensation claims against the parties, including PP, held 
responsible for cleanup of such sites. Such natural resource damage 
claims against PP could result in material additional liabilities. General Due to the environmental issues discussed above or other 
environmental matters, PP may be required to modify, replace or cease 
operating certain facilities to comply with statutes, regulations and 
actions by regulatory bodies or courts. In this regard, PP also may 
incur capital expenditures, operating expenses and other costs in amounts 
which are not now determinable but which could be material.
Loan Guarantees of Affiliated Companies PP Global has guaranteed a subsidiary pro rata share of the 
outstanding portion of certain debt issuances of an affiliate. At 
December 31, 1997, $13 million of such loans were guaranteed by PP 
Global. PP Global guarantee is expected to increase to $18 million 
during 1998, as the affiliate draws down the balance of its debt 
facility. IEC has arrangements with banks under which the banks may lend funds 
to IEC on an uncommitted basis. PP has been authorized by the PUC to 
guarantee up to $45 million of these bank loans or to lend up to $45 
million under a fixed rate loan agreement with PP IEC has been 
authorized by the PUC to have a maximum of $45 million outstanding at any 
one time under both of these loan arrangements. In addition, PP Spectrum has a $1 million line of credit, which is 
guaranteed by PP Resources.
Source of Labor Supply At December 31, 1997, PP had a total of 6,343 full-time employees. 
Approximately 65 percent of these full-time employees are represented by 
the IBEW. The labor agreement with the IBEW expires in May 1998.
17. New Accounting Standards During 1997, the FASB issued SFAS 128, Earnings Per Share; SFAS 129, 
Disclosure of Information about Capital Structure; SFAS 130, Reporting 
Comprehensive Income; and SFAS 131, Disclosures About Segments of an 
Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS 128 and SFAS 129 are effective 
for financial statements issued for periods ending after December 15, 
1997, however these statements cause no additional disclosures. SFAS 130 
and SFAS 131 are effective in 1998. The adoption of these statements is 
not expected to have a material impact on PP Resources' or PP 
financial statements. PP Resources, Inc.
