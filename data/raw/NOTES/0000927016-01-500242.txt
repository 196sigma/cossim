NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Summary of Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements of BJ Wholesale Club, Inc. the
Company include the financial statements of all of the Company
subsidiaries, all of whose common stock is wholly owned by the Company.
Fiscal Year
Through January 30, 1999, the Company fiscal year ended each year on the
last Saturday in January. Beginning with the fiscal year ended January 29,
2000, the Company fiscal year ended on the Saturday closest to January 31.
The fiscal year ended February 3, 2001 included 53 weeks. The fiscal years
ended January 29, 2000 and January 30, 1999 included 52 weeks.
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
The Company considers highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments with
maturities exceeding three months are classified as marketable securities.
Merchandise Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined under the average
cost method, or market. The Company recognizes the write-down of slow-moving or
obsolete inventory in cost of sales when such write-downs are probable and
estimable.
Property and Equipment
Property is depreciated by use of the straight-line method for financial
reporting purposes. Buildings are depreciated over 33 1/3 years. Leasehold
costs and improvements are amortized over the lease term or their estimated
useful life, whichever is shorter. Furniture, fixtures and equipment are
depreciated over three to ten years. Interest related to the development of
owned facilities is capitalized.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
The Company periodically reviews the realizability of its long-lived assets
in relation to current and expected operating results and cash flows in order
to assess whether there has been an impairment of their carrying values.
Accounts Payable
The Company banking arrangements provide for the daily replenishment of
vendor payable accounts as checks are presented. The balances of checks
outstanding in these bank accounts totaling $54,918,000 at February 3, 2001 and
$57,571,000 at January 29, 2000 are included in accounts payable on the balance
sheet.
Membership Fees
Membership income is recognized over the life of the membership, which is
typically twelve months. See Notes A. and L.
Preopening Costs
Preopening costs consist of direct incremental costs of opening or
relocating a facility and are charged to operations as incurred. See Note A.
22 Stock-Based Compensation
The Company applies the accounting provisions prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,
APB 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for its stock-based
compensation.
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value
because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 1998, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, was issued.
The adoption of this statement, which becomes effective in 2001, is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company results of operations,
financial position or cash flows, or to produce any major changes in current
disclosures.
Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No.
101 was released on December 3, 1999 and provides the staff views in
applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue
recognition issues. The implementation of SAB 101 did not have a material
effect on the Company results of operations, financial position or cash
flows.
In March 2000, The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions involving
Stock Compensation. This pronouncement, which became effective July 1, 2000,
clarifies the application of APB 25 for certain stock compensation issues. The
application of FASB Interpretation No. 44 in 2000 had no effect on the
Company results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Estimates Included in Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Other
Certain amounts in the prior years' financial statements have been
reclassified for comparative purposes.
A. Accounting Principle Changes
During the fiscal year ended January 30, 1999, the Company adopted changes
in methods of accounting for membership fee revenues and preopening expenses.
The Company had previously recognized membership fee revenues as income
when received. Under its current accounting method, the Company recognizes
membership fee revenues as income over the life of the membership, which is
typically twelve months. The Company recorded a noncash charge of $18,216,000
after reduction for income taxes of $11,646,000, or $24 per diluted share,
as of the beginning of 1998 to reflect the cumulative effect of this change on
prior years.
23  Prior to 1998, preopening expenses were charged ratably to operations
between the date a new club opened and the end of the fiscal year. Upon
implementing the provisions of the American Institute of CPA Statement of
Position 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities, the Company
recognizes club preopening expenses when incurred. The Company recorded a
noncash charge of $1,110,000 after reduction for income taxes of $710,000, or
$01 per diluted share, as of the beginning of 1998 to reflect the cumulative
effect of this change on prior years.
B. Spin-off of the Company from Waban Inc. and Related Party Transactions
The Company, which previously had been a wholly owned subsidiary of Waban
Inc. Waban, became a separate and independent public entity on July 28,
1997, when Waban distributed to its stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the
Company outstanding common stock the spin-off.
Pursuant to the spin-off, the Company and Waban entered into a Tax Sharing
Agreement to provide for the payment of taxes and the entitlement to tax
refunds for periods prior to the spin-off date. Each party has agreed to
indemnify the other in specified circumstances if certain events occurring
after July 28, 1997 cause the spin-off or certain related transactions to
become taxable.
Since the spin-off, the Company has provided certain services to Waban
which has since changed its name to HomeBase, Inc. HomeBase at rates
negotiated in accordance with a Services Agreement entered into between the
Company and HomeBase. The amounts received by the Company for these services
were not material.
C. Debt
The Company has a $200 million unsecured credit agreement with a group of
banks which expires July 9, 2002. The agreement includes a $50 million sub-
facility for letters of credit, of which $34 million was outstanding at
February 3, 2001. The Company is required to pay an annual facility fee which
is currently 010% of the total commitment. Interest on borrowings is payable
at the Company option either at a the Eurodollar rate plus a margin which
is currently 025%, b the agent bank prime rate or c a rate determined by
competitive bidding. The facility fee and Eurodollar margin are both subject to
change based upon the Company fixed charge coverage ratio. The agreement
contains covenants which, among other things, include minimum net worth and
fixed charge coverage requirements and a maximum funded debt-to-capital
limitation, prohibit the payment of cash dividends on the Company common
stock, and generally limit the cumulative repurchase of the Company common
stock to $50 million plus 50% of net income as defined by the agreement
earned after January 30, 1998.
The Company also maintains a separate line in the amount of $41 million for
letters of credit, primarily to support the purchase of inventories, of which
$108 million was outstanding at February 3, 2001, and an additional $20
million uncommitted credit line for short-term borrowings.
There were no bank borrowings outstanding at February 3, 2001 and January
29, 2000.
D. Commitments and Contingencies
The Company is obligated under long-term leases for the rental of real
estate and fixtures and equipment, some of which are classified as capital
leases pursuant to SFAS No. 13. In addition, the Company is generally required
to pay insurance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses and, in some
cases, additional rentals based on a percentage of sales or increases in the
Consumer Price Index. The real estate leases range up to 45 years and have
varying renewal options. The fixture and equipment leases range up to 5 years.
24  Future minimum lease payments as of February 3, 2001 were                               Capital Operating

Rental expense under operating leases including contingent rentals, which
were not material amounted to $68,906,000, $57,148,000 and $48,226,000 in
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
The Company is involved in various legal proceedings that are typical of a
retail business. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these
proceedings or any related claims, the Company believes that such proceedings
or claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition or results of operations.
In connection with the spin-off of Waban by The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX
in 1989, Waban and TJX entered into an agreement pursuant to which Waban agreed
to indemnify TJX against any liabilities that TJX might incur with respect to
42 current HomeBase leases as to which TJX was either a lessee or guarantor. In
connection with the spin-off of the Company from Waban in 1997, the Company
agreed to indemnify TJX for any liabilities TJX may incur with respect to
HomeBase leases through January 31, 2003, and thereafter it will indemnify TJX
for 50% of such liabilities. Although HomeBase is primarily liable for these
leases, there can be no assurance that HomeBase will be able to make all future
payments under these leases. As of February 3, 2001, the Company maximum
undiscounted pre-tax contingent liability under the TJX indemnification
agreement was estimated to be approximately $220 to $230 million. As of January
31, 2003, the estimated amount decreases to approximately $130 to $140 million.
These amounts include estimated real estate taxes and common area maintenance
charges. These estimates do not take into consideration the reduction in the
Company contingent liability that would result from any subleasing of the
properties.
E. Capital Stock
On February 4, 1999, the Company Board of Directors declared a two-for-one
stock split effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend, which was
distributed on March 2, 1999 to stockholders of record on February 16, 1999.
The split was effected by reissuing the 803,638 treasury shares held by the
Company and issuing 36,098,862 additional shares of common stock on the
distribution date. The stock split is recorded in the financial statements for
the fiscal year ended January 30, 1999. All historical earnings per share
amounts have been restated to reflect the stock split. Reference to stock
activity before the distribution of the split has not been restated unless
otherwise noted.
The Company has a shareholder rights plan, originally adopted in 1997 and
amended in 1999, pursuant to which shareholders are issued one-half of a Right
as adjusted for the two-for-one stock split for each share of common stock.
Each Right entitles the holder to purchase from the Company 1/1000 share of
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock Series A Preferred Stock at a
price of $120. The Company has designated 100,000 shares of Series A Preferred
Stock for issuance under the shareholder rights plan; none has been issued to
date. Generally, the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock are designed so that
1/1000 share of Series A Preferred Stock is the economic equivalent of one
share of the Company common stock. The Rights are
25 exercisable only if a person acquires 20% or more of the Company common stock
or commences a tender offer that would result in such person owning 30% or more
of the Company common stock. In addition, in general, if after a person has
become a 20% owner, the Company is involved in a business combination
transaction in which it is not the surviving corporation or in connection with
which the Company common stock is changed, or the Company disposes of 50% or
more of its assets or earning power, each Right that has not previously been
exercised or voided will entitle its holder to purchase that number of shares
of common stock of such other person which equals $120 divided by one-half of
the then current market price of such common stock. The Company will generally
be entitled to redeem the Rights at $01 per Right at any time until the tenth
business day following public announcement that a person has become a 20%
owner. The Rights expire on July 10, 2007, unless earlier redeemed or
exchanged.
The Company has authorized 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $01 par
value, of which no shares have been issued.
In December 1997, one of the Company subsidiaries issued 126 shares of
non-voting preferred stock to individual stockholders at $2,200 per share.
These shares are each entitled to receive ongoing annual dividends of $200 per
share. The minority interest in this subsidiary is equal to the preferred
shares' preference in an involuntary liquidation of $277,200 and is included in
other noncurrent liabilities in the Company consolidated balance sheets at
February 3, 2001 and January 29, 2000.
F. Stock Incentive Plans
All references in this footnote to historical awards, outstanding awards and
available shares for future grants under the Company stock incentive plans
and related per share amounts reflect the two-for-one stock split distributed
on March 2, 1999.
Under its 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, the Company has granted certain key
employees options to purchase common stock at prices equal to 100% of market
price on the grant date. These options, which expire ten years from the grant
date, are generally exercisable 25% per year starting one year after the grant
date. The maximum number of shares of common stock issuable under this plan is
5,249,402 shares, plus shares subject to awards granted under the BJ
Wholesale Club, Inc. 1997 Replacement Stock Incentive Plan the Replacement
Plan which are not actually issued because such awards expire or are
canceled. Under the Replacement Plan, which expired on January 28, 1998, BJ
employees who held Waban stock options and restricted stock were granted
replacement BJ options and restricted stock, which preserved the same
inherent value, vesting terms and expiration dates as the Waban awards they
replaced in connection with the spin-off.
Under its 1997 Director Stock Option Plan, BJ external directors are
granted options to purchase common stock at prices equal to 100% of market
price on the grant date. These options expire ten years from the grant date and
are exercisable in three equal annual installments beginning on the first day
of the month which includes the first anniversary of the date of grant. A
maximum of 300,000 shares may be issued under the 1997 Director Stock Incentive
Plan.
As of February 3, 2001 and January 29, 2000, respectively, 1,349,287 and
2,635,708 shares were reserved for future stock awards under the Company
stock incentive plans.
The Company applies APB 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for its
stock-based compensation. Total pre-tax compensation cost recognized in the
statements of income for stock-based employee compensation awards was $23,000
in 2000, $19,000 in 1999 and $163,000 in 1998 and consisted entirely of
restricted stock expense, which is charged to income ratably over the periods
during which the restrictions lapse. 2,000 shares of restricted stock were
issued during 2000 at a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $370625. No
restricted stock was issued in 1999. During 1998, 2,000 shares of restricted
stock were issued at a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $1972. No
compensation cost has been recognized under APB 25 for the Company stock
options because the exercise price equaled the market price of the underlying
stock on the date of grant.
26  Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and has
been determined as if the Company had accounted for its stock options under the
fair value method of that statement. The fair value for these options was
estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following weighted-average assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 612 619% and 516% in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively; volatility factor of the
expected market price of the Company common stock of 42 in 2000 and 1999 and
35 in 1998; and expected life of the options of 5 years in 2000, 1999 and
1998. No dividends were expected. The weighted-average fair value of options
granted was $1621 in 2000, $1320 in 1999 and $721 in 1998.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of
highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.
Because the Company employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its stock options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The Company
pro forma information follows                      Fiscal Year Ended

disclosure are not necessarily representative of the effects on reported net
income for future years because options vest over several years and additional
awards generally are made each year. In accordance with the transition
requirements of SFAS No. 123, the pro forma disclosures above include stock
options awarded only after January 28, 1995.

The Company has not established a valuation allowance because its deferred
tax assets can be realized by offsetting deferred tax liabilities and future
taxable income, which management believes will more likely than not be earned,
based on the Company historical earnings record.
I. Pensions
The Company participated in the Waban Inc. Retirement Plan, a non-
contributory defined benefit retirement plan covering full-time employees who
had attained twenty-one years of age and had completed one
29 year of service. Effective July 26, 1997, this plan was terminated. The Company
recorded a pre-tax charge applicable to its participants of $1,521,000 in 1998
when the plan was settled through lump-sum cash payments and through the
purchase of nonparticipating annuity contracts.
Under the Company 401k Savings plans, participating employees may make
pre-tax contributions up to 15% of covered compensation. The Company matches
employee contributions at 100% of the first one percent of covered compensation
and 50% of the next four percent. The Company expense under these plans was
$3,166,000, $2,657,000 and $2,471,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
The Company has a non-contributory defined contribution retirement plan for
certain key employees. Under this plan, the Company funds annual retirement
contributions for the designated participants on an after-tax basis. For the
last three years, the Company contributions equaled 5% of the participants'
base salary. Participants become fully vested in their contribution accounts at
the end of the fiscal year in which they complete four years of service. The
Company pre-tax expense under this plan was $990,000, $856,000 and $718,000
in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
J. Postretirement Medical Benefits
The Company has a defined benefit postretirement medical plan which covers
employees and their spouses who retire after age 55 with at least 10 years of
service, who are not eligible for Medicare, and who participated in a Company-
sponsored medical plan. Amounts contributed by retired employees under this
plan are based on years of service prior to retirement. The plan is not funded.
