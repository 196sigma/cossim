REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Melita International Corporation:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Melita
International Corporation a Georgia corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1997 and 1998 and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders' equity, comprehensive income and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Melita International
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1998 and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

MELITA INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1997 AND 1998
1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Melita International Corporation Melita or the Company provides
customer contact and customer relationship management systems that enable its
customers to operate efficient call centers. The Company principal product is
an integrated system comprised of both hardware and software. Melita offers
ongoing maintenance support for its products, as well as fee-based installation,
education and consulting services. The Company markets its products worldwide
through direct sales forces and through distributors in Europe, Latin America
and Asia Note 7.
COMPLETION OF INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
On June 4, 1997, the Company completed an initial public offering the
Offering of 4,025,000 shares of common stock at $10 per share resulting in
net proceeds of $36,046,000.
BASIS OF COMBINATION
Prior to June 4, 1997, the financial statements are presented on a combined
basis and include the accounts of Melita, Melita Europe Limited Melita
Europe and Inventions, Inc. Inventions, since all were under common
control. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in combination.
Concurrent with the Offering, the shareholders of Melita Europe and
Inventions contributed their respective shares in exchange for 3,143,395 shares
of Melita. The combination was treated similar to a pooling of interests and no
step-up basis was recorded as the entities involved were under common control.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying financial statements since June 4, 1997 include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash or cash equivalents.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The Company marketable securities are categorized as available-for-sale
securities, as defined by the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities. Unrealized holding gains and losses are reflected as a net amount
in a separate component of shareholders' equity until realized. For the purpose
of computing realized gains and losses, cost is identified on a specific
identification basis.

MELITA INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or
market. Cost includes raw materials, labor, and overhead. Market is defined as
replacement cost for work in progress and raw materials and net realizable value
for finished goods. Inventories consist of the following at December 31, 1997
and 1998 in thousands:
1997   1998
Raw  $1,251  $ 143
Work in    457    37
Finished    753  1,080
Total  $2,461  $1,260
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. The straight-line method of
depreciation was adopted for property placed in service after September 30,
1997. Prior to September 30, 1997, an accelerated method was used. The
difference between the accelerated method and the straight-line method was
immaterial. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Furniture and fixtures. Five to seven years
Three to seven years
Leasehold improvements. Remaining life of lease
INCOME TAXES
Prior to June 4, 1997, Melita and Inventions were organized as S
corporations under the Internal Revenue Code and, therefore, were not subject to
federal income taxes. The income or loss of Melita and Inventions was included
in the shareholders' individual federal and state tax returns, and as such, no
provision for income taxes was recorded in the accompanying combined statements
of operations. The Company historically made distributions to cover the
shareholders' anticipated tax liability.
In connection with the Offering, the Company converted its U.S. taxable
status from an S corporation to a C corporation and, accordingly, became subject
to federal and state income taxes. Upon the conversion, the Company recognized a
one-time benefit by recording deferred tax assets of $1,473,000.
The accompanying financial statements prior to June 4, 1997 reflect a
provision for income taxes on a pro forma basis as if the Company were liable
for federal and state income taxes as a taxable corporate entity throughout the
years presented. The pro forma income tax provision has been computed by
applying the Company anticipated statutory tax rate to pretax income, adjusted
for permanent tax differences Note 3.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The financial statements of Melita Europe are translated into U.S. dollars
in accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. Net assets of
Melita Europe are translated at the current rates of exchange at December 31.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate for the
year. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders'
equity. The Company has recognized foreign exchange gains losses of
approximately $162,000, $20,000 and $23,000 in 1996, 1997 and 1998,
respectively.

31
MELITA INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company generates product revenues primarily from its principal
product, an integrated system comprised of both hardware and software. The
Company service revenues are generated from maintenance contracts which
include support, parts and labor, and software update rights. Service revenues
also include fee-based installation, training, and consulting services.
The Company recognizes product revenues when a contract has been executed,
the product has been shipped and the Company has no significant obligations yet
to be satisfied. The Company sales contracts provide for certain payment terms
normally based upon signing the contract, customer receipt of the product, and
commencement of operation of the customer system.
Revenues from maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the term of
the contractual support period which ranges up to 5 years. If maintenance is
included in the original integrated product contract, such amounts are unbundled
from the license fee based on the value established by independent sale of such
maintenance to customers. Consulting revenues are primarily related to
implementation services performed under separate service arrangements related to
the installation of the Company hardware and software products. Revenues from
consulting, installation, and training services are recognized as the services
are performed.
Deferred revenues primarily relate to products that have not yet been
delivered and maintenance services which have been paid by the customers prior
to the performance of those services. Deferred revenue amounted to $4,029,000
and $5,965,000 at December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively.
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Research and development expenditures are charged to expense as incurred.
Software development costs are charged to research and development expense until
technological feasibility is established, after which remaining software
production costs are capitalized in accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for
Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. The
Company has defined technological feasibility of its products as the point in
time at which the Company has a working model of the related product, which is
when the product has achieved beta status. Historically, the development costs
incurred during the period between the achievement of beta status by a product
and the point at which the product is available for general release to customers
have not been material. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that the amount
of development costs capitalizable under the provisions of SFAS No. 86 was not
material to the financial statements for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997
and 1998. Therefore, the Company has charged all software development costs to
expense as incurred for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998.
WARRANTY COSTS
The Company generally warranties its products for 90 days and provides for
estimated warranty costs upon shipment of such products. Warranty costs have not
been and are not anticipated to be significant.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are
limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets for which the Company
services are provided as well as their dispersion across many different
geographic areas. As a result, as of December 31, 1997 and 1998, the Company did
not consider itself to have any significant concentrations of credit risk.
During 1997, only BankOne Services Corporation now First USA Bank, at 118 accounted for greater than 10% of total revenues. During 1998, only CitiGroup,
at 131%, accounted for greater than 10% of total revenues. In 1996, 1997 and
1998, the Company five largest customers accounted for approximately 245 279% and 232%, respectively, of total revenues. These sales
30

MELITA INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
were predominantly to customers in the financial services industry. Although the
particular customers may change from period to period, the Company expects that
large sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a
significant percentage of its revenues in any particular period for the
foreseeable future.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
BASIC AND DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share and pro forma basic earnings per share are
computed using net income or pro forma net income divided by the sum of i the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding Weighted
Shares for the period presented including the number of shares issued in the
combination of Melita, Melita Europe and Inventions discussed in Note 1 and ii
for periods prior to the Offering, the number of shares pursuant to Staff
Accounting Bulletin 1B3 that at the assumed public offering price would yield
proceeds in the amount necessary to pay the distribution to the majority
stockholder as a result of the Offering that are not covered by the earnings for
the year Distribution Shares.
The only difference between basic and diluted net earnings per share is the
result of the treasury stock method effect of common equivalent shares CESs.
Diluted earnings per share and pro forma diluted earnings per share is computed
using net income or pro forma net income divided by the sum of i Weighted
Shares, ii the Distribution Shares and iii the treasury stock method effect
of CESs outstanding of 275,000, 554,000 and 622,000 for the years ended December
31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The book values of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other
financial instruments approximate their fair values at December 31, 1997 and
1998 principally because of the short-term maturities of these instruments.
ACCRUED LIABILITIES
Accrued liabilities at December 31, 1997 and 1998 include the following in
thousands:
1997   1998
Accrued salaries and  $3,279  $ 4,935

provides for annual rentals of approximately $542,000 to $636,000 per year over

LEGAL MATTERS
Many of the Company installations involve products that are critical to
the operations of its clients' businesses. Any failure in a Company product
could result in a claim for substantial damages against the Company, regardless
of the Company responsibility for such failure. Although the Company attempts
to limit contractually its liability for damages arising from product failures
or negligent acts or omissions, there can be no assurance the limitations of
liability set forth in its contracts will be enforceable in all instances.

MELITA INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in
the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of
potential liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect the
financial position or results of operations of the Company.
6. STOCK OPTION PLANS
During 1992, the Company approved a stock option plan the 1992 Plan for
key employees for which 640,000 shares of common stock were authorized for use
in the plan. During 1995, the number of authorized shares was increased to
1,000,000 shares of common stock. Options are granted at the fair market value
and are exercisable based on the specific terms of the grant up to ten years
from the grant date. Options granted primarily vest ratably over a four- or
five-year employment period. The Company reserved the right to purchase vested
options at the then-estimated fair market value prior to the date of an IPO.
During 1996, the Company purchased 30,250 vested but unexercisable options held
by terminated employees for $39,774. No options were purchased during 1997 or
1998. Cash paid to repurchase options is expensed as incurred.
On February 6, 1997, the Company approved the 1997 Stock Option Plan the
1997 Plan for which 1,350,000 shares of common stock were authorized for
issuance, less any options issued under the 1992 Plan. In October of 1997, the
Company increased the number of shares available under the 1997 Plan to
1,850,000. On May 11, 1998, the shareholders approved an amendment to the 1997
Plan whereby the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under
the 1997 Plan will automatically be adjusted on the first day of each fiscal
year, beginning with 1998, by a number of shares such that the total number of
shares reserved for issuance under the 1997 Plan equals the sum of i the
aggregate number of shares previously issued under the 1997 Plan and the 1992
Plan; ii the aggregate number of shares subject to then outstanding options
granted under the 1997 Plan and the 1992 Plan; and iii 5% of the number of
shares of common stock outstanding on the last day of the preceding fiscal year.
Options are granted at the fair market value and are exercisable based on the
specific terms of the grant up to ten years from the grant date. The options
vest primarily over a four-year period subject to acceleration upon the
achievement of certain performance measures.

During 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123,
which defines a fair value-based method of accounting for an employee stock
option plan or similar equity instrument. However, it also allows an entity to
continue to measure compensation cost for those plans using the method of
accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Entities electing to remain with the
accounting in APB No. 25 must make pro forma disclosures of net income and, if
presented, earnings per share, as if the fair value-based method of accounting
defined in the statement had been applied.
The Company has elected to account for its stock-based compensation plan
under APB No. 25; however, the Company has computed for pro forma disclosure
purposes the value of all options granted during 1996 and 1997 using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model as prescribed by SFAS No. 123 using the
following weighted average assumptions used for grants in 1996, 1997 and 1998:
1996     1997     1998
Risk-free interest rate. 54%-65%   57%-65%   40%-55%

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
The total value of the options granted during the years ended December 31,
1996, 1997 and 1998 were computed as approximately $264,000, $1,716,000 and
$6,613,000, respectively, which would be amortized over the vesting period of
the options. If the Company had accounted for these plans in accordance with
SFAS No. 123, the Company reported earnings and pro forma earnings and net
income per share and pro forma net income per share for the years ended December
