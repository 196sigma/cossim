FiberTower Corporation 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FiberTower Corporation as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
convertible preferred stock and stockholders' equity deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of FiberTower Corporation at December31,
2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. 
As
discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for stock based compensation as of January1, 2006, and its
method of accounting for uncertain tax positions as of January1, 2007. 
We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of FiberTower Corporation internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated March17, 2008 expressed an adverse opinion thereon. s/ERNST YOUNG LLP San Francisco, California

Note1Organization and Business 
Organization and operationsFiberTower Corporation formerly known as First Avenue Networks,Inc. First Avenue and
collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company was incorporated in 1993 in the State of Delaware to build and operate a shared high-capacity backhaul network for wireless operators and
service providers in the United States. 
The
Company is a leading provider of facilities-based backhaul services to wireless carriers. Backhaul is the transport of voice, video and data traffic from a wireless carrier mobile
base station, or cell site, to their mobile switching center or other exchange point where the traffic is then switched onto a fixed wireline telecommunications network. The Company utilizes its
comprehensive wireless spectrum assets to provide backhaul services through a hybrid radio/fiber network architecture. The Company services allow wireless carriers to optimize their networks,
enabling significant improvements in their availability, reliability, scalability and cost, while providing a long-term solution for the increasing demand for backhaul capacity. As of
December31, 2007, the Company had master service agreements with six of the eight largest U.S. wireless carriers. Through these master service agreements and other customer agreements, the
Company provided services to 2,148 billing sites in 12 markets throughout the U.S. as of December31, 2007. In addition, the Company expects to begin billing customers in the Atlanta market in
the first quarter of 2008. 
The
Company spectrum portfolio includes, on average, over 740 MHz in the top 20 U.S. metropolitan areas and, in the aggregate, approximately 15billion channel pops, calculated
as the number of channels in a given area multiplied by the population, as measured in the 2000 census, covered by these channels. The
Company is subject to a number of risks associated with its relatively early stage of development, including, but not limited to, dependence on key employees, dependence on key
customers and suppliers, potential competition from larger, more established companies, the ability to develop and bring new services or products to market including expansion of the Company
network, the ability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel and the ability to obtain adequate financing to support its growth. 
The
Company has incurred losses and negative cash flows from operating and investing activities since its inception, and it had an accumulated deficit of $3745million at
December31, 2007. Through December31, 2007, the Company has relied primarily on equity and debt financings to fund its operating and investing activities. Management expects operating
losses and negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future. Failure to generate sufficient revenue could have a material adverse effect on the Company results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows. The recoverability of assets is highly dependent on the ability of management to execute its business plan. 
First Avenue/FiberTower merger transactionOn August29, 2006, FiberTower Network Services Corp. formerly known as
FiberTower Corporation and referred to hereinafter as Old FiberTower and First Avenue completed a merger pursuant to a merger agreement the Merger Agreement dated May14, 2006. Under
the terms of the Merger Agreement, all of the outstanding shares of Old FiberTower SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock SeriesA were converted to shares of Old FiberTower common
stock immediately prior to the completion of the merger. Accordingly, First Avenue issued 73,885,330 shares of common stock in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Old
FiberTower. In addition, First Avenue issued options for 4,206,682 shares of its common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding stock options of Old FiberTower. However, since this transaction
has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition of First Avenue by Old FiberTower, the 
63 
FIBERTOWER CORPORATION 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
Note1Organization and Business Continued financial
statements reflect the transaction as if Old FiberTower had issued consideration to First Avenue shareholders. Immediately
following the completion of the merger, the stockholders and option holders of Old FiberTower owned approximately 51%, on a fully diluted basis, of the outstanding shares of
First Avenue. In addition, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Chief Executive Officer CEO of First Avenue became the CEO of the combined company. Old FiberTower designated five members
and First Avenue designated three members to the Board of Directors of the combined company. Each standing committee of the Board of Directors consists of one member designated by First Avenue and one
or two members designated by Old FiberTower. First Avenue was renamed FiberTower Corporation following the completion of the merger. The
merger of First Avenue and Old FiberTower has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition of First Avenue by Old FiberTower under the purchase method of accounting because Old
FiberTower stockholders owned a majority of the shares, on a fully diluted basis, of the combined company following the merger. 
In
order to affect the merger described above, each share of Old FiberTower common stock was exchanged for 3040542 shares of the Company stock. Accordingly, the numbers of common and
preferred shares, par values and per share information included herein has been retroactively restated to give effect to the merger. The
accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the operating results of Old FiberTower on a historical basis and the Company operating results subsequent to the effective
date of the merger, August29, 2006. See Note3 for additional information. 
Note2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Principles of consolidation and basis of presentationThese consolidated financial statements include all of the assets,
liabilities and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 
Use of estimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
The Company critical accounting estimates include iuseful life assignments and impairment evaluations associated with long-lived assets, including intangible assets,
iirevenue recognition, iiiestablishment of accounts receivable allowances, ivasset retirement obligations, vdeferred rent, vivaluation of derivatives
embedded in the Company convertible senior secured notes, viivaluation of Old FiberTower common stock and the Company stock-based awards, and viiiestablishment of valuation
allowances associated with deferred tax assets. 
Cash equivalentsThe Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities, the Company classifies all cash equivalents as available-for-sale at the time of purchase, and it re-evaluates such
designation at each balance sheet date. Cash equivalents are stated at their cost adjusted for accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums. Such adjusted cost approximates the fair market
values of the Company cash equivalents as of December31, 2007 and 2006. Unrealized 
64 
FIBERTOWER CORPORATION 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Note2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued gains
and losses on available-for-sale securities were insignificant at December31, 2007 and 2006. The Company cash equivalents, including restricted balances,
consisted of money market mutual funds, bankers acceptances, and commercial paper issued by major U.S. and foreign corporations with an aggregate adjusted cost and fair market value of
$2158million and $3362million as of December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on cash equivalents are included in interest
income. 
Certificates of depositAs of December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had $50million of certificates of
deposit with a maturity of less than three months. These investments are classified as held to maturity and carried at cost which approximates market. Interest on the certificates of deposit is
included in interest income as earned. 
Short-term investmentsThe Company had no short-term investments with a maturity of greater than three
months at December31, 2007. At December31, 2006, the Company had $153million of such investments. These investments were classified as held-to-maturity
and carried at cost which approximated market. Interest on short-term investments is included in interest income as earned. Restricted cash and investmentsAt December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had total restricted cash and investments of
$370million and $705million, respectively, comprised of $353million and $690million, respectively, of principal and interest invested in U.S. Treasury securities
under the terms of the Company convertible senior secured notes. See Note7 for additional information. These securities are classified as held-to-maturity and are
reported at amortized cost. Restricted investments with maturity dates in 2008 of $353million at December31, 2007 are classified as current assets and relate to interest payments on
the Company Convertible Senior Secured Notes due in that year. Gross unrealized losses on these U.S. Treasury securities, which relate to changes in market interest rates, were $02million
as of December31, 2007. Accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on restricted investments are included in interest income. 
At
December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had an additional $17million and $15million, respectively, of restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily related
to a service supplier agreement. The Company also maintains letters of credit in connection with other obligations totaling $06million and $05million at December31, 2007 and
2006, respectively, These were collateralized by cash equivalents of $04million at each of those dates. The final expiration date of the letters of credit is June 2011. Fair values of financial instrumentsThe Company has determined the estimated fair values of financial instruments using
available market information and management judgment. Accordingly, these estimates are not necessarily reflective of the amounts that would be realized in a current market exchange. The aggregate
estimated fair values of the Company financial instruments, consisting of cash, and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, accounts receivable and accounts
payable approximated their respective carrying values as of December31, 2007 and 2006 based on the liquidity of these instruments and their short term nature. See Note7 for disclosure
of the fair value and carrying value of the Company Senior Secured Convertible Notes. 
Revenue and expense recognitionThe Company recognizes revenues when ipersuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
iithe services have been provided to the customer, iiithe sales price is fixed or determinable and ivthe collection of the sales price is reasonably assured. Amounts
billed in

of providing service are recorded as deferred revenues. There were $02million and $03million of deferred revenues at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
Incremental
direct costs of service activation are charged to expense as incurred. The Company purchases electricity and leases co-location site space from certain of its
customers. The Company receives an identifiable benefit in exchange for the amounts paid to its customers and the Company can reasonably estimate the fair value of the purchased electricity and leased
tower site space. Therefore, such amounts are charged to cost of service revenues as incurred, unless the amount paid exceeds the respective fair value, in which case the differential is recorded as a
reduction of service revenues. Other consideration provided to customers, such as customer incentives, is recorded as a reduction of service revenues. 
The
Company encounters billing disputes with certain customers in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes the impact of such disputes on its accounts receivable and service
revenues is reasonably estimable based on historical experience. Accordingly, the Company maintains an allowance, through charges to service revenues, based on management best estimate of the
ultimate resolution of customer disputes. The Company provided an allowance for billing disputes of a negligible amount as of December31, 2007 and $02million as of December31,
2006. 
The
Company performs ongoing evaluations of its customers' financial condition and generally does not require collateral or other credit enhancements. The Company records an allowance
for bad debts based on historical experience and management best estimate of future credit losses. The Company provided an allowance for doubtful accounts of $02million as of
December31, 2007 and a negligible amount as of December31, 2006. 
The
Company writes off uncollectible accounts receivable balances through charges to the respective allowances when collection efforts have been exhausted. 
Concentrations of credit risk, significant customers and key suppliersFinancial instruments that potentially subject the
Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, restricted cash and cash equivalents, restricted investments and accounts receivable.
Cash, cash equivalents, certificates of deposit and restricted cash and cash equivalents consist principally of demand deposits, certificates of deposit and money market mutual funds held primarily by
two domestic financial institution with a high credit standing and commercial paper issued by a number of major corporations and financial institutions. Restricted investments consist of U. S.
Treasury securities. 
For
the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the following customers accounted for a significant portion of the Company revenues, as follows: 2007
2006
2005 ATT Mobility
57 70 88 Sprint Nextel
19 14 9 T-Mobile
13 7 2 66

receivable from these customers comprised the following percentages of the Company gross accounts receivable balances at December31, 2007 and 2006: 2007
2006 ATT Mobility
45 85 Sprint Nextel
23 10 T-Mobile
21 10 The
percentage of total accounts receivable represented by ATT Mobility at December31, 2007 was lower than at December31, 2006, as the December31, 2006 balance
included receivables for early terminations which were settled in the first quarter of 2007. 
The
Company is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for certain equipment used to provide its services. The Company has generally been able to obtain an adequate supply of such
equipment. However, an extended interruption in the supply of equipment currently obtained from its suppliers could adversely affect the Company business and results of operations. Property and equipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation
and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or their estimated
useful lives. Estimated useful lives are as follows: Network equipment
10 years Internal-use computer software
5 years Office equipment and other
3-7 years The
Company capitalizes costs incurred in bringing its network equipment to an operational state. Costs directly associated with the acquisition, construction and installation of network
equipment are capitalized as a cost of that equipment. Indirect costs that relate to several sites are capitalized and allocated to the respective network equipment to which the costs relate. Other
indirect costs are charged to expense as incurred. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, network equipment and construction-in-progress included capitalized internal labor
costs of $171million, and $114million, respectively. 
Interest
is capitalized on network equipment and construction-in-progress based on the effective interest rate on the Company borrowings and the average balance
of assets under construction during the period. For the year ended December31, 2007, network equipment and construction-in-progress included $64million of
capitalized interest. No interest was capitalized for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005 as interest costs subject to capitalization were immaterial in those years. 
The
Company accounts for software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. SOP98-1 requires entities to capitalize certain costs related to internal-use
software once certain criteria have been met. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, capitalized internal-use software included capitalized internal labor costs of $16million
and $14million, respectively. 
Property
and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is 
67 
FIBERTOWER CORPORATION 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
Note2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued recognized
whenever ithe estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than
the carrying value of the asset and iithe fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value. When an impairment loss is identified, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its
fair value. Such impairment losses were identified in the third and fourth quarters of 2007. See Note5 for further information. 
During
2005, pursuant to an amendment of a contract with one of the Company customers, the Company received a cash payment from such customer in the amount of $06million. This
contract amendment allows the customer to terminate the Company services at specified co-location sites that are used to serve such customer along with other customers, in most
instances, if so requested by the customer. This contract amendment resulted in the decommissioning of certain co-location sites during 2007, 2006 and 2005 that were used exclusively to
serve this customer. The network equipment located at these sites have been redeployed elsewhere in the Company network. However, the related equipment installation and co-location site
acquisition costs had no alternative use or salvage value. Therefore, the Company considered the net carrying value of these long-lived assets to be impaired by $06million 06million and $01million as of December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These long-lived asset impairment charges are included in cost of service revenues. 
Asset retirement obligationsThe Company recognizes liabilities for asset retirement obligations relating to the estimated
costs of removing network equipment from its leased co-location sites, as stipulated in the related lease agreements. The asset retirement obligations are recognized in the period in which
they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of their fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived
assets and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. 
A
summary of the asset retirement obligations activity is as follows in thousands: Year Ended December31 2007
2006 Asset retirement obligations at beginning of year 2,119 571 Liabilities incurred in the current year 865 1,090 Liabilities settled in the current year Accretion expense 327 205 Revisions in estimated cash flows 253 Asset retirement obligations at end of year 3,311 2,119 Intangible assetsThe Company accounts for its intangible assets, which consist of Federal Communications Commission FCC
licenses, goodwill and customer relationships, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
SFAS142 which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives not be amortized, but be tested annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment
arise. Intangible assets that have finite lives, which consist of customer relationships, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life of 10years. The
Company, as described more fully below, evaluates its intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, and between annual evaluations if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. In cases where required, an impairment provision is recognized in an amount by which the carrying value
exceeds the estimated fair value of such assets.

Note2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued  FCC licensesRecoverability of the carrying value of FCC licenses is dependent on numerous factors, including successful
deployment of networks and radio links or sales of such assets to a third party. The Company considers the FCC licenses to have an indefinite useful life under the provisions of SFAS142. The
Company performs an impairment test on these assets on an annual basis or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. 
The
Company estimates the fair value of its FCC licenses using a discounted cash flow model. Cash flow projections and assumptions, although subject to a degree of uncertainty, are based
on a combination of historical performance and trends, business plans and management estimate of future performance, giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive economic conditions.
Other assumptions include the weighted average cost of capital and long-term rate of growth for the Company business. The Company corroborates its determination of fair value of the FCC
licenses, using the discounted cash flow approach described above, with other market-based valuation metrics. An impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related
indefinite-lived intangible asset and charged to results of operations. The most significant assumptions within the Company discounted cash flow model are the discount rate, projected growth rate
and the Company future business plans. A change in future business plans or disposition of one or more FCC licenses could result in the requirement to test certain other FCC licenses. If any legal,
regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors were to limit the useful lives of our indefinite-lived FCC licenses, the Company would be required to test these intangible assets for
impairment in accordance with SFAS142 and amortize the intangible asset over its remaining useful life. 
The
Company has determined that its FCC licenses have indefinite useful lives based on the following factors: FCC
spectrum is a non-depleting asset;
The
licenses are integral to the business and the Company expects them to contribute to cash flows indefinitely;
License
renewal applications are generally authorized by the FCC subject to certain conditions, without substantial cost under a stable regulatory, legislative and legal
environment. The Company has filed for renewal of its licenses that expired in 2007. The Company fully expects the FCC to grant the renewals, therefore the Company does not believe there is any
impairment or any other indication that the assets do not have indefinite useful lives;
Maintenance
expenditures required to obtain future cash flows are not significant; and,
The
Company intends to use these assets for the foreseeable future. For
the license impairment test performed as of November1, 2007, the fair value of the FCC licenses was in excess of its carrying value. At December31, 2007 and 2006,
FiberTower FCC licenses had a carrying value of $3420million, which was based on a valuation of First Avenue assets that was prepared in connection the merger of First Avenue and Old
FiberTower. 
Customer Relationships intangibles assetThe customer relationships intangible asset is a finite lived asset being amortized
on a straight-line basis over 10years. Recoverability of its carrying value is dependent on numerous factors including continued generation of revenues from First Avenue
customers. The Company periodically evaluates whether the value of its customer relationships 
69 
FIBERTOWER CORPORATION 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Note2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued intangible
asset has been impaired. All of the customer relationships intangible is related to the merger of First Avenue and Old FiberTower. 
GoodwillGoodwill is recorded when the price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified
tangible and intangible assets acquired. All of the Company goodwill relates to the merger of First Avenue and Old FiberTower. Annually in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if
indicators of potential impairment exist, the Company performs a review to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill is impaired. In the third quarter of 2007, due to the indication of
potential impairment, the Company tested the fair value of its goodwill pursuant to the guidance in SFAS142 and did so again in the fourth quarter of 2007. This testing resulted in impairment
charges against the recorded goodwill totaling $1479million in 2007. In performing its evaluation, the Company compared the fair value of the Company single reporting unit to its carrying
value. The Company estimated the fair value of the reporting unit using both observed market equity values based on the Company publicly-traded stock price and the income approach, which requires
estimates of future operating results and cash flows discounted using an appropriate discount rate. As a result of these tests, the Company concluded that the carrying amount of its reporting unit
exceeded its fair value. See Note6 for additional information. 
Debt issuance costsDebt issuance costs consist of investment banking fees, legal and accounting fees and printing costs
incurred in connection with the sale of the Company Convertible Senior Secured Notes in November 2006, described further at Note7. Debt issuance costs totaled $143million and are
being amortized as additional interest expense over the six-year term of the Notes using the effective interest method. Accumulated amortization totaled $25million at
December31, 2007 and $03million at December31, 2006. 
Stock-based compensationEffective January1, 2006, the Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance
with SFAS123R, Share-Based Payment SFAS123R. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, stock-based compensation
cost related to employees and non-employees is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period, which is the vesting period. 
Prior
to 2006, the Company accounted for stock-based payments to employees under the recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB25. Under the intrinsic-value method set forth in APB25, no compensation cost was
required to be recognized for awards that had an exercise price equal to, or greater than, the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. 
The
Company accounted for stock options granted to non-employees based on the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring,
or in Conjunction with, Selling Goods or Services. 
The
Company adopted SFAS123R on a prospective basis. Under the prospective method, the Company continues to account for previously outstanding stock options at the date of
adoption of SFAS123R under APB25 and for stock options granted to non-employees under EITF Issue No96-18. The
Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of stock options on the date of grant. The determination of the estimated fair value
is affected by 
70 
FIBERTOWER CORPORATION 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
Note2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued our
stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the option, actual
and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate, estimated forfeitures and expected dividends. 
The
Company estimates its expected stock price volatility based on the historical volatility of its stock price as well as the historical volatilities of similar public companies in the
telecommunications industry. The expected term of the option is based on the guidance in the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No107. The risk-free interest rate for periods within
the contractual life of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The Company has not and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on its common
stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, the Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. 
The
Company determines the fair value of each restricted common stock award based on the fair value of the Company common stock at the date of award. 
The
Company is required to estimate forfeitures at the time of award and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company uses
historical data to estimate pre-vesting award forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. 
Advertising CostsAdvertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expense as incurred. The Company incurred no
advertising costs during the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. 
Income taxesThe Company uses the liability method to account for income taxes as required by SFAS No109, Accounting for
Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting
and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. See Note11 Income Taxes for additional information. 
The
Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes on January1,
2007. See Note11 Income Taxes for additional information. 
Net Loss per shareBasic and diluted net loss per share for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 has been
calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of the Company common shares outstanding which have been retroactively restated by multiplying the Company historical weighted
average common shares outstanding by the merger exchange ratio, less issued common shares subject to repurchase or forfeiture, and excludes any dilutive effects of stock options, warrants and
convertible notes. Diluted net loss per share was the same as basic net loss per share in all periods presented because the Company had net losses in each of these periods and inclusion of potentially
issuable shares would be anti-dilutive.

December31, 2007, there are 23million unvested restricted shares. See Note6 Subsequent Event for the cancellation of stock options and restricted shares to be reflected in the
first quarter of 2008, as a result of the resignation of the Company CEO in January 2008. 
The
Company Convertible Senior Secured Notes became convertible on February15, 2007. As of December31, 2007, 486million shares were potentially issuable if all
currently outstanding Notes were converted and 116million additional shares could be potentially issuable upon conversion of additional notes that could be issued as payment for interest on
the Notes. There are also warrants outstanding at December31, 2007, to acquire 29million common shares. These potentially issuable shares would further dilute investors when the
options and warrants are exercised, the restricted share awards vest and the Notes are converted to common shares. 
Segment reportingThe Company operates in one business segment. 
Recent accounting pronouncementsIn September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value
Measurements SFAS157. SFAS157 establishes specific criteria for the fair value measurements of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities under
current accounting rules. The new fair value criteria are primarily applied prospectively upon adoption of SFAS157. SFAS157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November15, 2007. In February2008, the FASB amended SFAS157 to exclude SFAS No13, Accounting for Leases, from its scope
and approved a one-year delay in applying SFAS157 to certain fair value measurements, primarily related to non-financial instruments such as business combinations, acquired goodwill and
intangibles, long-lived assets held for disposal and liabilities related to exit or disposal activities. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of SFAS157 on its consolidated
financial statements. 
In
February, 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of
SFAS115 SFAS159. SFAS159 permits a company to voluntarily elect to use fair value, instead of historic or original cost, to account for certain
financial assets and liabilities. The fair value option is designated on an item-by-item basis, is irrevocable and requires that changes in fair value in subsequent periods be recognized in earnings
in the period of change. On the date of adoption, if the fair value option is elected for any existing financial assets or liabilities, all previously unrealized gains or losses, if any, will be
charged directly to retained earnings as a cumulative-effect adjustment. Items eligible for the fair value option include available-for-sale

Note2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued securities,
held-to-maturity securities, and loans payable. SFAS159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the potential
impact of SFAS159 on its consolidated financial statements. Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS159, the election to use the fair value method for future eligible transactions will be
made on a case-by-case and instrument-by-instrument basis. Note3Merger with First Avenue 
As stated in Note1, Old FiberTower and First Avenue completed their merger on August29, 2006. The merger of Old FiberTower and First Avenue has
been accounted for as a reverse acquisition of First Avenue by Old FiberTower under the purchase method of accounting. 
The
total purchase price for this merger was $5496million, consisting of 672million shares of vested First Avenue common stock with a fair value of approximately
$5202million, fully vested warrants for the purchase of 29million shares of First Avenue common stock with a fair value of approximately $200million, fully vested options
for the purchase of 34million shares of First Avenue common stock with a fair value of approximately $75million, a merger-related restructuring liability of $01million and
$19million in direct transaction costs, consisting of legal and other professional services fees. The fair value of First Avenue common shares outstanding as of August29, 2006 was
based on the closing price of First Avenue common stock on August29, 2006. 
The
total purchase consideration was as follows in thousands: Shares Issued
Fair Value Shares of First Avenue common stock
67,204 520,160 First Avenue stock options and warrants
6,282 27,501 Acquisition-related costs 1,917 Merger-related restructuring liability, net 65 Total purchase consideration 549,643 The
First Avenue warrants and stock options outstanding on August29, 2006 were valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. 
The
fair value of unvested First Avenue options for the purchase of 846,667 common shares, which was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, totaled $25million,
and was deducted from the purchase consideration and is being recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period. An additional 689,600 shares of unvested restricted common stock with a fair
value of $35million is also being recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period. The
purchase consideration was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on management analysis and estimates of their fair values. The purchase consideration,
including the

2007, the Company continued to refine its analysis of its deferred tax liability pursuant to EITF Issue No93-7, Uncertainties Related to
Income Taxes in a Purchase Business Combination. As part of this analysis, the Company adjusted the 2006 estimated tax rate to the 2006 actual tax rate which was lower than the
estimate. This resulted in a decrease of $94million to the deferred tax liability and required a corresponding decrease of $94million to goodwill. See Note11 for additional
information. 
During
the year ended December31, 2007, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling $1479million. See Note6 for additional information. Goodwill is
not deductible for tax purposes. 
As
part of the merger between Old FiberTower and First Avenue, FiberTower incurred severance and relocation expenses of $01million during the year ended December31,
2006. These activities were part of a merger-related plan contemplated prior to closing, and have been incorporated into the purchase price pursuant to the guidance in EITF Issue
No95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination. The
valuation of the FCC licenses was based on multiple methodologies applied to the 24 GHz and 39 GHz spectrum acquired including an income approach that discounted projected cash flows
using a discount rate that took into account the risk associated with the Company business model as well as an approach that valued the contribution of spectrum to the Company business plan and
previous spectrum sales including prior FCC auctions. The FCC licenses have been determined to have indefinite lives. 
The
valuation of the customer relationships was based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The customer relationship intangible asset is being amortized on a straight-line
basis over 10years. Amortization of the customer relationship intangible asset totaled $03million and $01million in the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, and will amount to $03million in each of the next four years. 
Old
FiberTower merged with First Avenue in order to gain access to First Avenue FCC area-wide licenses. These licenses allow the Company to access lower cost technologies
that will allow the Company to more effectively serve its customer base. The Company believes that the First Avenue assets combined with Old FiberTower existing network will enable the Company to

75   FIBERTOWER CORPORATION 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
Note5Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Other Charges  Construction of the Company network operations is a complex process involving the interaction and assembly of multiple components including internal labor,
third party costs and equipment costs. The Company regularly assesses the realizability of costs accumulated in construction-in-progress as it executes its network build plans.
In 2007, the Company conducted a re-design and implementation of enhanced internal controls associated with property and equipment that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2007. As a
result of this effort and the Company normal realizability assessment process, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $124million in the fourth quarter of 2007 to reduce network
equipment and
construction-in-progress to net realizable value. This impairment charge is included in cost of service revenues for the year ended December31, 2007. During
the third quarter of 2007, the Company suspended development activities in the Carolina market where the Company had not yet generated billing customers. Third party project
management fees and construction costs, capitalized as construction-in-progress, had an aggregate net carrying value of $44million at September30, 2007 and had
no alternative use or salvage value. Therefore, in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets, the Company considered these long-lived assets to be impaired as of September30, 2007. The resultant long-lived asset impairment charge
of $44million is included in cost of service revenues for the year ended December31, 2007. In
connection with the suspension of development activities in this market, the Company paid contract termination costs and one-time termination benefits totaling
$02million. These were accounted for in accordance with SFAS146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit and Disposal Activities and
have been included in cost of service revenues for the year ended December31, 2007. 
Cost
of service revenues also includes $06million, $06million and $01million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, of
long-lived asset impairment charges related to the decommissioning of sites. Note6Impairment of Goodwill 
At December31, 2006, the carrying value of the Company goodwill of $2434million related to the merger of First Avenue and Old FiberTower and
was determined by purchase price allocation. This allocation was based on management analysis and estimates of the fair values of First Avenue tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. See Note3 for additional information. 
As
a result of a decline in the Company market capitalization below the carrying value of its equity during the quarter ended September30, 2007, the Company believed an
indicator of impairment existed and, accordingly, performed an interim review of the value of its goodwill. In the quarter ended September30, 2007, the Company concluded that the carrying
value of goodwill was impaired and
recorded an impairment charge of $614million, reducing the fair value of goodwill to $1820million at September30, 2007. 
In
the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company decreased the amount allocated to goodwill in connection with the merger with First Avenue by $94million which required a
corresponding decrease to the deferred tax liability. See Notes3 and 11 for additional information. During
the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company performed its annual impairment test of the value of its goodwill. The Company concluded that the carrying value of goodwill was further
impaired and 
76 
FIBERTOWER CORPORATION 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Note6Impairment of Goodwill Continued recorded
an additional impairment charge of $865million, reducing the fair value of goodwill to $861million at December31, 2007. 
In
performing its impairment tests, the Company compared the fair value of the Company single reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company estimated the fair value of the
reporting unit using both observed market equity values based on the Company publicly-traded stock price and the income approach, which requires estimates of future operating results and cash flows
discounted using an appropriate discount rate. As a result of these tests, the Company concluded that the carrying amount of its reporting unit exceeded its fair value. The Company estimates
resulted from an updated long-term financial outlook developed as part of its strategic planning cycle conducted annually during the fourth quarter. 
The
total goodwill impairment charges of $1479million in 2007 are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of further declines in
market equity value, the Company expects that an additional impairment test of goodwill will be required in the first quarter of 2008 which could lead to additional material impairment charges,
including possibly, the entire remaining balance of goodwill. Note7Convertible Senior Secured Notes 
On November9, 2006, the Company completed the sale of $4025million of 900% Convertible Senior Secured Notes Notes that mature on
November15, 2012. The Notes were sold to the initial purchasers in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Notes are fully
guaranteed, jointly and severally Guarantees, by the Company and each of its subsidiaries Guarantors. 
The
Notes bear interest at a coupon rate of 9% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on May15 and November15 each year. As required by the
indenture governing the Notes, the Company used $685million of the net proceeds to acquire U. S. Treasury securities to provide for the payment, in full, of the first four
semi-annual interest payments. These securities may only be used to pay the interest or other payments required by the indenture and are reflected as restricted investments in the
consolidated balance sheet. On May15, 2007 and November15, 2007, the Company made its first two interest payments of $187million and $181million, respectively. 
Subject
to certain conditions, commencing May15, 2009, the Company has the option of making any or all of the four semi-annual interest payments due in 2009 and 2010
with additional notes in lieu of cash. Such additional notes would bear interest at an annual rate of 11%. If
not redeemed or converted prior to maturity, the Company will be required to repay the Notes for 125411% of their initial principal amount, or $5048million. The Company is
accreting the principal premium ratably over the six-year period until the Notes mature and is recognizing such accretion as additional interest expense. The effect of this accretion is to
increase the effective yield to the holders to 12% per annum based on the par value of the Notes. 
The
Notes and Guarantees are secured by a first priority pledge of substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and by a first priority pledge of the stock of all
of its subsidiaries, subject, in each case, to a prior lien to secure a working capital facility, if any, of up to $500million. The Notes rank senior to all of the Company and the
Guarantors' existing and future subordinated indebtedness.

Note7Convertible Senior Secured Notes Continued The
Notes are not redeemable by the Company before November15, 2010. If the Company common stock exceeds specified trading values, the Company may redeem any of the Notes, in
whole or in part at any time on or after November15, 2010, at 100% of the aggregate accreted principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any. 
The
Notes may be converted into the Company common shares at an effective conversion price of $829 per share which is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. Holders who
convert their Notes prior to November15, 2009 or convert their Notes prior to November15, 2010 in connection with certain designated events related to consolidations and mergers, will
receive a make-whole premium. 
The
Notes contain certain anti-dilution provisions that will cause the conversion price of the Notes to be reduced iupon the Company issuing or selling common stock
or other securities convertible into common stock with aggregate proceeds of $250million or more prior to November15, 2008; and iiif the Company has not consummated common
stock issuances or sales for aggregate proceeds of at least $500million by November15, 2008. 
A
majority of the Company shareholders executed written consents approving the issuance of shares of common stock in connection with the possible conversion of the convertible notes.
The number of common shares that could be issued would increase if the anti-dilution provisions of the Notes are triggered before conversion. This increase is capped at a 33% increase in
the total number of shares. 
The
Notes contain covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the Company future indebtedness and the payment of dividends. As of December31, 2007, the Company is
in compliance with all of the covenants. 
If
certain designated events occur prior to maturity, the holders may require the Company to repurchase all or part of their Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 101% of their
aggregate accreted principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any. The
Company and the Guarantors filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, covering the resale of the Notes, Guarantees and the shares of common
stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, that was declared effective on April26, 2007. The Company and the
Guarantors will be required to pay liquidated damages if they fail to keep the shelf registration statement effective during specified time periods. 
The
Company concluded that the embedded feature related to the make-whole premium, designated event make-whole premium and holder put option upon the occurrence
of certain designated events, qualify as derivatives and should be bundled as a compound embedded derivative Derivative under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities. 
The
fair value of the Derivative as of December31, 2007 was negligible. The change in fair value of the Derivative for the year ended December31, 2007 totaled
$06million and from the date of issuance of the Notes through December31, 2006 totaled $11million. This has been recorded as miscellaneous income, net in the consolidated
statements of operations. 
The
Company monitors the fair value of the Derivative each reporting period and records changes in fair value through charges to miscellaneous income, net with an offsetting adjustment

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued  Note9Convertible Preferred Stock 
In July 2005, Old FiberTower issued 456million shares of SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock in a financing that generated net cash proceeds of
$1498million. As a result of the SeriesA financing, all 300million issued and outstanding shares of SeriesA-1, SeriesB and SeriesC
Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into 225million shares of SeriesA. 
As
described in Note1, all shares of SeriesA were converted on a one-to-one basis into shares of the Company common stock
immediately prior to the consummation of the merger with First Avenue. See Note3 for additional information. 
Note10Stockholders' Equity and Stock-Based Compensation 
Notes Receivable from StockholdersDuring July 2005, Old FiberTower accepted notes receivable
aggregating $40million from its founders in exchange for cash. Such notes were collateralized by all shares then owned by the founders. The notes bore interest at a fixed rate of 4164%. 
For
accounting purposes, the acceptance of these non-recourse notes receivable from Old FiberTower founders in exchange for cash was considered to be ithe
purchase of treasury shares by Old FiberTower and iithe simultaneous issuance to the founders of unexercised, partially vested options to purchase the number of shares of Old FiberTower
common stock that collateralize the notes. Such deemed options had intrinsic value at the date of grant because the exercise price was less than the fair value of the common stock at such date, as
determined by Old FiberTower. With respect to the deemed purchase of treasury shares, the Company recorded the aggregate principal balance of the notes, along with interest subsequently accrued, as a
reduction of stockholders' equity. However, the related common shares were presented as issued and outstanding for financial reporting purposes because the holders of such shares were legally entitled
to vote these shares, participate in dividends, when and if declared by the Board of Directors, and enjoyed the other rights of ownership of such shares while the notes were outstanding. With respect
to the deemed issuance of unexercised, partially vested stock options to Old FiberTower founders, because the interest component of the notes was full-recourse, payable at maturity and
nonrefundable, such stock options constituted fixed stock-based awards, which resulted in the recognition of stock-based compensation expense aggregating $238,000. The stock-based compensation of
$189,000 associated with the vested portion of the deemed options was charged to operations at the date of grant in 2005. The remaining deferred stock-based compensation associated with the unvested
portion of the deemed options of $49,000 was recognized over the vesting period which ended in 2006 using the graded vesting method. 
The
notes receivable from stockholders, plus accrued interest, were fully repaid prior to the completion of the merger with First Avenue. Old FiberTower Stock PlanIn May 2001, Old FiberTower adopted a stock option plan the Old FiberTower Stock Plan pursuant
to which the Board of Directors was authorized to grant
options to purchase common stock, or issue shares of common stock, to employees, officers, directors, advisors or consultants of Old FiberTower. Incentive stock options ISOs and nonqualified stock
options NSOs were granted with an exercise price equal to the estimated fair value of the common stock at the date of grant. All options issued under the Old FiberTower Stock Plan have a
ten-year term, become fully exercisable upon vesting, and generally vest over one to four years. As
a result of the merger discussed in Notes1 and 3, all outstanding options and Restricted Stock Awards under this plan were legally assumed by First Avenue and this plan was
discontinued effective August29, 2006. All existing outstanding options and Restricted Stock Awards continued under the

terms of the original grant agreements including the ten year contractual life of options as adjusted for the merger exchange ratio with respect to the number of shares and per share price. 
FiberTower Corporation Stock Incentive Plan formerly First Avenue Stock Incentive Plan As a result of the Merger discussed
in Notes1 and 3, Old FiberTower, as the acquirer of First Avenue, assumed options for the purchase of 42million common shares that had been granted by First Avenue under its Stock
Incentive Plan the Stock Incentive Plan prior to the merger. 
First
Avenue amended the Stock Incentive Plan, effective as of August29, 2006 as follows: 1provided for the issuance of restricted shares as well as ISOs and NSOs;
2increased the number of shares reserved for issuance under the plan from 76million shares to 233million shares; 3provided for annual awards of restricted shares
with an aggregate value of $85,000 to each non-employee director, and 4allowed for an annual increase in the aggregate authorized shares to 15% of the then outstanding common
shares. In addition, options granted under the Stock Incentive Plan have a maximum term of up to five years. 
On
August20, 2007, pursuant to the terms of the Stock Incentive Plan that allow for an annual increase in the aggregate authorized shares available for grant, an additional
22million shares became available under the Stock Incentive Plan, for a total number of shares reserved for issuance under the Stock Incentive Plan of 255million shares. See
Note16 Subsequent Event for the effect on the disclosures below to be reflected in the first quarter of 2008, as a result of the resignation of the Company CEO in January

weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 was $257 per share and $382 per share,
respectively. 
As
of December31, 2007, there was approximately $74million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options. This compensation cost is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 15years. The
aggregate fair value of options that have been accounted for under SFAS123R and that vested during the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 was $36million
and $10million, respectively. 
In
connection with the merger of First Avenue with Old FiberTower, the Company agreed to provide certain severance benefits, including cash compensation and the acceleration of vesting
of 50%

FIBERTOWER CORPORATION 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
Note10Stockholders' Equity and Stock-Based Compensation Continued of
the then outstanding stock options, to any of Old FiberTower officers who were actually or constructively terminated within 12months of the merger. During the year ended
December31, 2007, one executive of Old FiberTower terminated employment and options for 31,068 shares were accelerated under this agreement. During the year ended December31, 2006,
four executives of Old FiberTower terminated employment and options for 109,880 shares were accelerated under this agreement. Share based payment expense of $02million was recorded in
connection with these option modifications in 2006 with none recorded in 2007. 
Certain
of the Company key employees' stock option and restricted share agreements provide that, upon a change in control of the Company, 100% of the stock options and restricted
shares granted to such employees will be fully vested. 
Unless
otherwise stipulated by the Board of Directors, Restricted Stock Awards to employees under the Stock Incentive Plan vest over a four-year period from the grant date.
During 2007 and 2006, Restricted Stock Awards to certain directors vested immediately, including the annual awards to each non-employee director, while other Restricted Stock Awards vested
over periods of less than four years, as stipulated in the respective award agreements. Prior to vesting, the Restricted Stock Awards have voting rights and are entitled to dividends. Therefore, such
shares are considered outstanding for financial reporting purposes, but are included in the net loss per share computations only to the extent vested.

Accounting for Income Taxes, requires income taxes to be accounted for under an asset and liability approach that
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company consolidated financial statements or tax
returns. In estimating future tax consequences, the Company generally takes into account all expected future events then known to it, other than changes in the tax law or rates, which are not
permitted to be considered. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of valuation allowance is
based on management best estimate of the recoverability of the net deferred tax assets. While future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning are considered in determining the
amount of the valuation allowance, the necessity for and amount of the allowance is subject to adjustment in the future. Specifically, in the event the Company were to determine that it would not be
able to realize the net deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts, an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination
was made. The valuation allowance does not alter the Company ability to utilize the underlying tax net operating loss carryforwards in the future, the utilization of which is limited to achieving
future taxable 
85 
FIBERTOWER CORPORATION 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
Note11Income Taxes Continued income.
Accordingly, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets at December31, 2007 and 2006. During
the year ended December31, 2007, the Company decreased the valuation allowance by $4400million primarily due to the net operating loss limitation under Internal
Revenue Code Section382 Section382 as described below. A majority of the valuation allowance relates to tax benefits associated with the merger with First Avenue See
Notes1 and 3. 
At
December31, 2007, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1,6164million for federal income tax purposes. These net operating loss
carryforwards begin to expire in 2016 and fully expire in 2027. During 2007, the Company completed an analysis pursuant to Section382. The analysis indicates that there will be approximately
$1,1375million of net operating losses that will expire unused due to the Section382 limitation. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a further
substantial annual limitation due to historical or future ownership change rules provided by Section382. 
To
the extent any of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance recognized in connection with the merger is subsequently reversed, it will be recognized first as a reduction of goodwill,
then as a reduction of other intangible assets and, lastly, as a reduction of current period income tax expense. The Company estimates that approximately $115million of the total valuation
allowance is attributable to deferred tax assets acquired in connection with the merger. 
In
2007, the Company continued to refine its analysis of its deferred tax liability recognized in connection with the merger, pursuant to EITF Issue No93-7, Uncertainties Related to Income Taxes in a Purchase Business
Combination. As part of this analysis, the Company adjusted the 2006 estimated tax rate to
the 2006 actual tax rate which was lower than the estimate. This resulted in
a decrease of $94million to the intangible assets deferred tax liability and required a corresponding decrease of $94million to goodwill. The
Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes, FIN48 on January1, 2007. As a result of adopting FIN48, the Company did not record any cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of
retained earnings and additional paid-in-capital. Under FIN48, the Company will recognize the tax benefit of a tax position that the Company takes or expects to take in
a tax return, when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. For these positions, the Company will recognize an amount of tax
benefit that is greater than 50percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority. Tax benefits for tax positions that are not more likely than not of being
sustained upon examination will be recognized, generally, when the tax position is resolved through examination or upon the expiration of the statute of limitations. 
The
Company balance of unrecognized income tax benefits for uncertain tax positions at January1, 2007 and December31, 2007 was zero. Additionally, there were no
changes, either increases or decreases, in the balance during the year. As such, the Company has not accrued any interest or penalties on such positions. Furthermore, at such time an unrecognized tax
benefit is recorded, the Company will classify interest and penalties as part of income tax expense. The
statute of limitations for federal and state tax purposes are generally three and four years respectively; however, the Company continues to carryover tax attributes prior to these
periods for

and state purposes, which would still be open for examination by the respective tax authorities. All years since inception are open to tax examinations. 
Note12Retirement Savings Plan 
The Company maintains a 401k retirement savings plan the Savings Plan for its permanent employees. Each participant in the Savings Plan may elect to
contribute a percentage of his or her annual compensation to the Savings Plan, up to a specified maximum amount per year. The Company,
at its discretion, may also make contributions to the Savings Plan. The Company made no contributions to the Savings Plan during the years ended December31, 2007 and 2005. The Company made a
$01million contribution to the Savings Plan during the year ended December31, 2006. 
Note13Related Party Transactions 
During the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company leased colocation space from certain stockholders that iown greater than 10% of
the Company outstanding equity securities and/or iihave representatives who serve on the Company Board of Directors. One of these related parties also provided the Company with certain
services pertaining to its network operations center during such years. The aggregate operating expenses included in the accompanying statements of operations for years ended December31, 2007,
2006 and 2005, pertaining to these lease and service arrangements were approximately $21million, $17million and $04million, respectively. 
During
the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, ia member of our Board of Directors and iione of our investors served as consultants to the Company on
various aspects of our business and strategy. These individuals were compensated for their services with varying amounts of cash and stock options, which we do not consider to be material to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Representatives
from two entities holding approximately 28% of the outstanding common stock serve on our Board of Directors. A company controlled by a member of the Board of Directors
periodically serves as a consultant to a holder of approximately 15% of the Company common stock regarding its investments, including its holdings in the Company. 
The
executive chairman of the Company Board of Directors, serves as a director of Tessco Technologies Incorporated. Tessco supplies the Company with various materials which are used in
the business operations. During 2007 and 2006, the Company paid Tessco approximately $08million and $07million, respectively. Tessco was not supplier to the Company in 2005. 
Note14Guarantees and Other Contingencies 
Regulatory MattersThe Company is subject to significant FCC regulation, some of which is in a state of flux due to challenges
to existing rules and proposals to create new rules. Such regulation is subject to different interpretations, inconsistent application and has historically given rise to disputes with other carriers
and municipalities regarding the classification of traffic, rates, rights-of-way and zoning matters. Management believes that resolution of any such disputes will not have a
material adverse impact on the Company consolidated financial position. 
87 
FIBERTOWER CORPORATION 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
Note14Guarantees and Other Contingencies Continued 
License RenewalLike other FCC licenses, the licenses which the Company holds were granted for an initial ten-year
term with renewal dates ranging from 2007 to 2014. Renewal applications for the Company wide-area 39 GHz licenses that expired in 2007 remain pending at the FCC. To obtain renewal of a
license, the licensee must demonstrate that, at the time of renewal, it either met a safe harbor build-out requirement or that it has provided substantial service as determined by the
FCC. What level of service is considered substantial will vary depending upon the type of offering by the licensee. The FCC has provided specific safe harbor guidance only for
point-to-point offerings, where it has indicated the licensee should have constructed four links per channel per million persons in the licensed area. Licensees may show that
they have met the substantial service test in other ways, such as providing niche services, offering service to underserved consumers and investing in the market in a credible manner to develop
equipment and systems to serve the license. 
Licensees
are required, prior to the expiration date of their licenses, to file renewal applications with an exhibit demonstrating compliance with the substantial service criteria. If an
entity is deemed not to have provided substantial service through meeting the safe harbor build-out requirement, or through other means, with respect to a license for which renewal is
sought, the renewal will not be granted and the license will expire. The Company does not currently meet the safe harbor guidance provided by the FCC for the substantial majority of its 24 and 39 GHz
licenses which expire in the 2010 and 2011 time frames. Since the Company is required to demonstrate substantial service at
the time the license is renewed, the FCC could choose to not renew licenses that do not meet the substantial service safe harbor. 
FCC
precedent for substantial service showings, especially those made outside the safe harbor structure, still remains thin, subject to FCC discretion and thus lacking a guarantee for
renewal. However, the Company has been meeting regularly with the FCC presenting data on the Company significant network investment and expanding geographic coverage to make the spectrum bands
viable and able to provide substantial service at renewal and in the long term. The Company continues to believe that it has met the substantial service requirements necessary for renewal and will
continue to engage the FCC on this subject. 
Other guaranteesFrom time to time, the Company enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require it to
indemnify various parties against claims from third parties. These contracts primarily relate to: icertain real estate leases, under which the Company may be required to indemnify property
owners for environmental and other liabilities and for other claims arising from the Company use of the applicable premises; iicertain agreements with the Company officers, directors and
employees, under which the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship; iiicontracts under which the Company may be
required to indemnify customers against third-party claims that a Company product or service infringes a patent, copyright or other intellectual property right; and ivprocurement or license
agreements under which the Company may be required to indemnify licensors or vendors for certain claims that may be brought against them arising from the Company acts or omissions with respect to
the supplied products or technology. 
Generally,
a maximum obligation under these contracts is not explicitly stated. Because the obligated amounts associated with these types of agreements are not explicitly stated, the
overall maximum amount of the obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, the Company has not 
88 
FIBERTOWER CORPORATION 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
Note14Guarantees and Other Contingencies Continued been
required to make payments under these obligations, and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations in the Company consolidated balance sheets. 
Legal proceedingsThe Company is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. In the
opinion of management, the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on the Company financial position or results of operations.

aEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures As
of December31, 2007, our management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Co-President and Chief Operating Officer
COO and Co-President and Chief Financial Officer CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to
Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act. Disclosure controls are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Form10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time
periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company management, including its principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
As
described below under Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, our management has identified and reported to our audit committee and Ernst
YoungLLP, our
independent registered public accounting firm, a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result of this material weakness, our COO and CFO have concluded that, as of
December31, 2007, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 
bManagement Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule13a-15f under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007. In making this assessment, our management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that
a material misstatement of the company annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In performing the assessment, management has identified the
following control deficiency that we have concluded is a material weakness in both the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007. Ineffective controls over the accounting for property and equipment As
a result of the material weakness identified in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2006, our management made multiple changes to
improve our internal control over financial reporting. One key change for the Company was a re-design and implementation of internal controls over the accounting for property and
equipment, including enhanced accounting systems, processes, policies and procedures that continued past December 31, 2007 and were initially applied in the preparation of our 2007 consolidated
financial statements. In connection with the initial operation of these controls, we identified and recorded a number of adjustments to our 2007 consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures, prior to including them in this report. 
91 
As
a result of the material weakness described above, management has concluded that, as of December31, 2007, our system of internal control over financial reporting was not
effective based on the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Our
independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, has issued an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in
their report in Item9Ad of this annual report. 
Remediation of 2006 Material Weakness
Management
reported a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2006. This material
weakness was primarily the result of several significant, complex transactions we experienced in 2006, including the merger of Old FiberTower with First Avenue Networks,Inc. and the
convertible senior secured notes offering, as well as significant turnover of our financial accounting and reporting staff. During the year ended December31, 2007, we have implemented changes
to our processes to improve our internal control over financial reporting. The following are among the steps we have taken to remediate the previously reported material weakness as of
December31, 2007: We
hired a Vice President, Corporate Controller with over 25years of accounting experience in the second quarter of 2007. The Controller has held senior financial
management positions in several publicly-held companies.
We
hired an Accounting Manager with over 15years of accounting experience in the first quarter of 2007. The Accounting Manager holds a Masters of Accounting degree,
and is a Certified Public Accountant.
We
hired a Fixed Asset Manager in the third quarter of 2007 with strong technical skills who has overall responsibility for the accounting for fixed assets.
We
identified the need to hire an SEC reporting expert to manage the assimilation of financial transactions and preparation of reports that comply with relevant rules and
regulations for timely review and approval of management, submission to the external auditors and ultimate filing with the SEC. This function will also evaluate the impact of non-routine
and non-systematic transactions for proper treatment under U.S.GAAP. We engaged a reputable firm to provide these resources and expertise until this hire is consummated.
We
successfully integrated our disparate general ledger accounting systems resulting in changes to the process of consolidation and preparation of our financial statements.
We
successfully implemented the re-design of our internal controls associated with property and equipment culminating in the review of the net realizable value
of all of our property and equipment as of December31, 2007.
We
engaged a reputable firm to provide us resources and expertise in our continuing assessment, redesign and improvement of our internal controls over financial reporting
and to assist in the implementation of the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section404 for our combined company in 2007. While
we have taken the above actions to remediate the 2006 material weakness, management intends to continue to make further improvements in internal controls, including hiring
additional accounting staff and further developing and enhancing accounting systems, processes, policies and procedures. The effectiveness of our remediation plan is subject to continued management
review, as well as Audit Committee oversight, and we may make additional changes to our internal control over financial reporting. 
92 
cChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During
the quarter ended December31, 2007, we made substantial progress on the implementation of the re-design of our internal controls associated with property and
equipment. We intend to further develop the re-designed controls over property and equipment throughout the first quarter and beyond in 2008 including assigning responsibility for execution of the
controls throughout various levels of our organization and focusing on increasing the precision, speed and efficiency of the controls. During the quarter ended December31, 2007, there were no
other changes in our internal control over financial reporting which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. dReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
FiberTower Corporation 
We
have audited FiberTower Corporation internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. FiberTower Corporation management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the Company annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
93  The
following material weakness has been identified and included in management assessment. Management has identified a material weakness in controls over the Company accounting for property and
equipment. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2007 consolidated financial statements, and this report does
not affect our report dated March17, 2008 on those financial statements. 
In
our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, FiberTower Corporation has not maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria. S/ERNST YOUNGLLP San
