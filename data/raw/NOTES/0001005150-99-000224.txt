To Startec Global Communications Corporation     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Startec
Global Communications Corporation a Maryland corporation and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, changes in stockholders' equity deficit, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998. These financial
statements  are the  responsibility  of the  Company  management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Startec Global
Communications Corporation and subsidiaries, as of December 31, 1998 and 1997,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

STARTEC GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Organization
Startec Global Communications Corporation the Company, formerly Startec,
Inc., is a Maryland corporation founded in 1989 to provide international
long-distance telephone services. The Company currently offers U.S.-originated
international long-distance service to residential and carrier customers through
a flexible network of owned and leased transmission facilities,  resale
arrangements, and foreign termination arrangements. The Company marketing
targets specific ethnic residential market segments in the United States that
are most likely to seek low-cost international long-distance service to specific
and identifiable country markets. The Company is headquartered in Bethesda,
Maryland.
In 1998, the Company board of directors and stockholders approved a
reorganization pursuant to which the Company corporate structure would be
realigned  to  that  of a  publicly  traded  Delaware  holding  company
Reorganization. Pursuant to the reorganization plan, subsequent to year end,
all of the Company assets were transferred into a Delaware subsidiary company
New Parent, with a subsequent transfer of those assets to multiple
subsidiaries of the New Parent. The Company was then merged with and into the
New Parent with the New Parent then assuming the Company name. The merger did
not impact the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
In October 1997, the Company completed an Initial Public Offering of its
common stock the Initial Public Offering. Together with the exercise of the
overallotment option in November 1997, the Initial Public Offering placed
3,277,500 shares of common stock at a price of $1200 per share, yielding net
proceeds after underwriting discounts, commissions, and other professional
fees to the Company of approximately $35 million.
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts
of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. During 1998,
the Company recorded a net favorable retroactive PTT rate adjustment in the
amount of $953,000 in a manner consistent with its policy of recording credits
when received. The rate adjustment relates to traffic sent from April 1997
through December 1998 and is reflected in cost of services in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations. These rate adjustments occur routinely.
Revenue recognition
Revenues for  telecommunication  services  provided to customers are
recognized as services are rendered, net of an allowance for revenue that the
Company estimates will ultimately not be realized. Revenues for return traffic
received according to the terms of the Company operating agreements with its
foreign partners are recognized as revenue as the return traffic is received and
processed.
The Company has entered into operating agreements with telecommunications
carriers in foreign countries under which international long-distance traffic is
both delivered and received. Under these agreements, the foreign carriers are
contractually obligated to adhere to the policy of the FCC, whereby traffic from
the foreign country is routed to international carriers, such as the Company, in
the same proportion as traffic carried into the country. Mutually exchanged
traffic between the Company and foreign carriers is settled through a formal
settlement policy at agreed upon rates per-minute. The Company records the
amount due to the foreign partner as an expense in the period the traffic is
terminated. When the return traffic is received in the future period, the
Company generally realizes a higher gross margin on the return traffic compared
to the lower margin or sometimes negative margin on the outbound traffic.
Revenue recognized from return traffic was approximately $26 million, $14
million and $11 million, or 2 percent, 2 percent, and 3 percent of net revenues
in 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively. There can be no assurance that traffic
will be                    47      STARTEC GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED
delivered back to the United States or what impact changes in future settlement
rates, allocations among carriers or levels of traffic will have on net payments
received and revenues recorded by the Company.
International operations
The consolidated statements of operations include amounts related to
non-U.S.  subsidiaries. In 1998, the Company recognized net revenues of
approximately $23,000 and a net loss of approximately $340,000 attributable to
non-U.S. subsidiaries.
Cost of services
Cost of services represents direct charges from vendors that the Company
incurs to deliver service to its customers. These include costs of leasing
capacity and rate-per-minute charges from carriers that originate, transmit, and
terminate traffic on behalf of the Company. The Company accrues disputed vendor
charges until such differences are resolved. see Note 4.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all short-term investments with original maturities
of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of
money market accounts that are available on demand. The carrying amount reported
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximates fair value.
Pledged Securities and restricted cash
In connection with the Senior Notes and Warrants Offering, the Company
placed $52 million of net proceeds into marketable securities to fund the first
six payments of interest on the Senior Notes which are payable semi-annually in
November and May. Subsequent to the November 1998 interest payment, pledged
securities totaled $442 million. The Company was required to provide a bank
guarantee of $180,000 in connection with one of its foreign  operating
agreements. This guarantee is in the form of a certificate of deposit. The
pledged securities and restricted cash are shown as long term assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company has both the positive
intent and ability to hold the pledged securities and restricted cash until
maturity. Accordingly, these instruments are carried at amortized cost.
Other current assets
Included in other current assets as of December 31, 1997, is approximately
$11 million for amounts due from employees related to the exercise of stock
options in December 1997. No cash was advanced to these employees. All amounts
due from employees for the payment of the exercise price and related payroll
taxes were collected in January 1998. During 1998, the Company advanced an
aggregate of approximately $14 million to certain of its employees and
officers. The secured loans bear interest at a rate of 787% per year, and are
due and payable on December 31, 1999. The loans are included in other current
assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Long-lived assets
Long-lived assets and identifiable assets to be held and used are reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount should be addressed. Impairment is measured by comparing the
carrying value to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to
result from the use of the assets and their eventual dispositions. The Company
considers expected cash flows and estimated future operating results, trends,
and other available information in assessing whether the carrying value of the
assets is impaired. The Company believes that no such impairment existed as of
December 31, 1998 and 1997.
The Company estimates of anticipated gross revenues, the remaining
estimated lives of tangible and intangible assets, or both, could be reduced
significantly in the future due to changes in technology, regulation, available
financing, or competitive pressures. As a result, the carrying amount of
long-lived assets could be reduced materially in the future.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at historical cost. Depreciation is
provided for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over
the following estimated useful lives                    48      STARTEC GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED     Property and leasehold     5 years
Long-distance communications equipment including
undersea  7 to 20 years
Computer and office  3 to 5 years
Long-distance communications equipment includes assets financed under
capital lease obligations of approximately $1,540,000 and $1,456,000 as of
December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  Replacements and
improvements are capitalized. Gains on sales of assets are recognized at the
time of sale or deferred to the extent required by generally accepted accounting
principles.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets, capitalized in connection with acquisitions made during
the fourth quarter of 1998 are reflected within intangibles and other long term
assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 1998,
intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, consisted of goodwill, a
German telecommunications license and a covenant not to compete of $35 million 18 million and $250,000, respectively. Goodwill and covenants not to compete
are amortized on a straight-line basis over 30 and 5 years, respectively. The
German telecommunications license acquired through the acquisition of Global
Communications GmbH of Germany is amortized on a straight-line basis over 30
years. Accumulated amortization at December 31, 1998 was immaterial.
Debt discounts and deferred debt financing costs
Deferred debt financing costs of $62 million, net of amortization of
$380,000 incurred primarily in connection with the 1998 Senior Notes and
Warrants Offering are reflected within intangible and other long term assets.
Debt discounts associated with the Senior Notes and Warrants Offering total $21
million, net of amortization of $129,000 are reflected as a reduction of the
Senior Notes. Debt discounts and deferred debt financing costs are amortized
over the remaining life of the debt using the effective interest method.
Concentration of credit risk
Financial  instruments  that  potentially  subject the Company to a
concentration of credit risk are accounts receivable. Residential accounts
receivable consist of individually small amounts due from geographically
dispersed customers. Carrier accounts receivable represent amounts due from
long-distance carriers. The Company allowance for doubtful accounts is based
on current market conditions. The Company four largest carrier customers
represented approximately 32 and 44 percent of gross accounts receivable as of
December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Revenues from several customers
represented more than 10 percent of net revenues for the periods presented see
Note 10. Including charges in dispute see Note 4, purchases from the five
largest suppliers represented approximately 30 and 47 percent of cost of
services for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Services
purchased from several suppliers represented more than 10 percent of cost of
services in the periods presented see Note 10. One of these suppliers,
representing 4and 7 percent of cost of services in the year ended December 31,
1998 and 1997, respectively, is based in a foreign country.
Income taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
SFAS No. 109 requires that deferred income taxes reflect the expected tax
consequences on future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their bases for financial reporting purposes.  Valuation
allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the
expected amount to be realized.
Earnings loss per common share
SFAS No. 128 requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per
share on the face of the statements of operations for all periods presented.
Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income
available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential
dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock
were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of

anti-dilutive effect on loss per share.
Advertising costs
In accordance with Statement of Position 93-7, Reporting on Advertising
Costs, costs for advertising are expensed as incurred within the fiscal year.
Such costs are included in Selling and marketing expenses in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations.
Year 2000
The Year 2000 issue arises because many computerized systems use two digits
rather than four to identify the year. The effects of the Year 2000 issue may be
experienced before, on, or after January 1, 2000, and if not addressed, the
impact on operations and financial reporting may range from minor errors to
significant systems failure, which could affect the Company ability to conduct
normal business operations. It is not possible to be certain that all aspects of
the Year 2000 issue affecting the Company, including those related to the
efforts of customers, suppliers, vendors or other third parties will be fully
resolved.
Risk and other important factors
The Company is subject to various risks in connection with the operation of
its business. These risks include, but are not limited to, dependence on
operating agreements with foreign partners, significant foreign and U.S.-based
customers and suppliers, availability of transmission facilities, U.S. and
foreign  regulations,  international  economic and political  instability,
dependence on effective billing and information systems, customer attrition, and
rapid technological change. Many of the Company competitors are significantly
larger and have substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing
resources than the Company; employ larger networks and control transmission
lines; offer a broader portfolio of services; have stronger name recognition and
loyalty; and have long-standing  relationships with the Company target
customers. In addition, many of the Company competitors enjoy economies of
scale that can result in a lower cost structure for transmission and related
costs, which could cause significant pricing pressures within the long-distance
telecommunications industry. If the Company competitors were to devote
significant additional resources to the provision of international long-distance
services to the Company target customer base, the Company business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected.
The Company has devoted substantial resources to the buildout of its
network and the development and expansion of its marketing programs. As a
result, the Company experienced operating losses and negative cash flows from
operations in 1998. These losses and negative operating cash flows are expected
to continue for additional periods in the future. There can be no assurance that
the Company operations will become profitable or will produce positive cash
flows. The Company capital requirements for the continued buildout of its
network and growth of its customer base are substantial. The Company intends to
fund its operational and capital requirements in 1999 using cash on hand and its
available credit facility. However, there can be no assurance that the Company
will not need additional external financing sooner than currently anticipated,
or that such financing would be available on terms management finds acceptable
or at all. In the event that the Company is unable to obtain such additional
financing, it will be required to limit or curtail its expansion plans.
In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission FCC and
relevant state Public Service Commissions have the authority to regulate
interstate and intrastate telephone service rates, respectively, ownership of
transmission facilities, and the terms and conditions under which the Company
services are provided.  Legislation that substantially  revised the U.S.                    50      STARTEC GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED Communications Act of 1934 was signed into law on February 8, 1996. This
legislation has specific guidelines under which the Regional Bell Operating
Companies RBOCs can provide long-distance services, which will permit the
RBOCs to compete with the Company in providing domestic and international
long-distance services. Further, the legislation, among other things, opens
local service markets to competition from any entity including long-distance
carriers, cable television companies and utilities.
Because the legislation  opens the Company  markets to additional
competition, particularly from the RBOCs, the Company ability to compete may
be adversely affected.  Moreover, certain Federal and other governmental
regulations may be amended or modified, and any such amendment or modification
could have material adverse effects on the Company business, results of
operations, and financial condition.
Recent accounting pronouncements
Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income. SFAS No. 130 requires the reporting of comprehensive
income loss in addition to net income loss from operations. Comprehensive
income is a more inclusive reporting methodology that includes disclosure of
certain financial information that historically has not been recognized in the
calculation of net loss. The adoption of SFAS No. 130 had no impact on the
Company net loss, as reported, and comprehensive loss.
In June 1997, SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information SFAS 131, was issued which redefines how operating
segments are  determined and requires  disclosures of certain  financial
descriptive information about a company operating segments. The January 1,
1998 adoption of SFAS No. 131 currently has had minimal impact on the required
disclosures and descriptive information about the Company operations. The
Company operates in a single business segment managed on a regional basis.
Currently, operating segments outside the North American region are immaterial.
In March 1998, Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use SOP 98-1, was
issued which provides guidance on addressing whether and under what conditions
the costs of internal use software should be capitalized. SOP 98-1 is effective
for all transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1998; however, earlier adoption is encouraged.  The Company adopted the
guidelines of SOP 98-1 on January 1, 1998, pursuant to which the Company
capitalized approximately $910,000 for 1998.
In April 1998, Statement of Position 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of
Start-Up Activities SOP 98-5, was issued which requires that entities
expense costs of start-up activities as incurred. The Company adopted SOP 98-5
on January 1, 1998 and expensed approximately $166,000 of start-up costs
incurred for organizational activities associated with the Company facilities
in the United Kingdom in 1998.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED Senior Notes and Warrants Offering
In May 1998, the Company issued $160 million of 12% senior unsecured notes
Senior Notes with a final maturity of May 2008. Warrants to purchase 200,226
shares of common stock were issued in conjunction with the Senior Notes
issuance. The Senior Notes are recorded at a discount of $21 million to their
face amount to reflect the fair market value attributable to the warrants. The
warrants are exercisable subsequent to November 1998 at an exercise price of
$2420 per share. The Company received net proceeds of $155 million, net of
offering expenses. Concurrent with the issuance, the Company purchased $52
million in U.S. Government obligations from proceeds of the offering. The U.S.
Government obligations are pledged to fund the first six interest payments on
the Senior Notes. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in
arrears in May and November commencing November 1998. Accrued interest as of
December 31, 1998 was $25 million. As of December 31, 1998, no Warrants issued
in connection with the Senior Notes have been exercised.
Under the terms of the Senior Notes, the Company is subject to certain
covenants which, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company to
incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions in respect to
capital stock or make certain restricted payments; create liens; or merge or
sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Senior Notes are redeemable at
the option of the Company, in whole or in part on or after May 15, 2003, at the
redemption prices set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
liquidated damages as defined in the indenture, if any, to the date of

offer to repurchase the outstanding Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated
damages, if any, to the date of purchase.
The Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari
passu in right of payment with all other existing and future unsecured and
unsubordinated obligations of the Company unless expressly noted.
NTFC Capital Corp. Financing Agreement
In December 1998, the Company entered into a vendor financing facility for
up to $35 million with NTFC Capital Corporation, a financing arm of GE Capital
NTFC Facility. The facility and may be used to finance switches, associated
telecommunications equipment, undersea fiber optic cables, and the expansion of
facilities in the Company targeted marketing areas. Each borrowing under the
NTFC Facility bears interest at a fixed rate equal to the average yield to
maturity of the five-year Treasury Note plus the Rate Adjustment as defined in
the agreement. Individual borrowings under the NTFC Facility are amortized over
60 months from the date of advance with a final maturity of all outstanding
amounts of January 2004. As of December 31, 1998, approximately $89 million
bearing interest at 891% was outstanding under the facility. Principal and
interest payments of approximately $184,000 are due monthly in arrears.
Under the terms of the NTFC Facility, the Company is subject to certain
financial and operational covenants, including but not limited to restrictions
on the Company ability to pay dividends and level of indebtedness.
Commercial Loan Agreement
In July 1997, the Company entered into a loan agreement Loan with a
commercial bank Lender. The Loan provides for maximum borrowings of up to
$10 million through December 31, 1997, and the lesser of $15 million or 85
percent of eligible                    53      STARTEC GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED
accounts receivable, as defined, thereafter until maturity in December 1999. The
Loan required a $150,000 commitment fee to be paid at closing, and a quarterly
commitment fee of one quarter percent of the unused portion. In December 1998,
the Company terminated the Loan. In connection with the termination, the Company
recognized an extraordinary loss of $514,000 related to the write-off of
deferred financing costs and debt discounts related to the Loan.
In connection with the Loan, the Company issued the Lender warrants to
purchase 539,800 shares of the Company common stock, representing 10 percent
of the outstanding common stock on the date of issuance. Fifty percent, or
269,900 of the warrants, vested fully on the date of the issuance. Vesting on
the remaining warrants was contingent on the occurrence of certain events. In
December 1997, as a result of the Company completed Initial Public Offering of
common stock, the remaining warrants were retired. The exercise price of the
outstanding warrants is $846 per share, and they expire on July 1, 2002. The
fair market value of the warrants is approximately $823,000 and is classified as
a component of stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 1998, 269,900 warrants
from this issuance were outstanding.

7. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY DEFICIT   Common and preferred stock
In 1997, the Board of Directors authorized 100,000 shares of $100 par
value preferred stock. Concurrent with the approval of the Reorganization, the
Board of Directors approved an increase in the authorized shares of common and
preferred stock. Subsequent to year end 1998, total common and preferred shares
authorized increased to 40,000,000 and 1,000,000, respectively pursuant to the
Reorganization. The Board of Directors has the authority to issue these shares
and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions,
including voting rights, of those shares without further vote or action by the
stockholders.
In July 1997, the Company exchanged 17,175 shares of its outstanding
nonvoting common stock for authorized voting common stock and purchased the
remaining 5,351 shares of outstanding nonvoting common stock from a former
officer and director of the Company for $45,269.
Stock option plans
In August 1997, the stockholders of the Company approved the 1997
Performance Incentive Plan the Performance Plan. The Performance Plan
provides for the award to eligible employees of the Company and others of stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and other stock-based
awards, as well as cash-based annual and long-term incentive awards. In 1998,
the Board of Directors and stockholders approved an increase in the shares
authorized for issuance under the Performance Plan to 185 percent of the common
shares outstanding. The options expire ten years from the date of grant and vest
ratably over five years. The Performance Plan provides that all outstanding
options become fully vested in the event of a change in control, as defined. As
of December 31, 1998 and 1997, approximately 914,890 and 352,000 options,
respectively, were available for grant under the Performance Plan.
The Company Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan, reserves 270,000
shares of voting common stock to be issued to officers and key employees under
terms and conditions to be set by the Company Board of Directors. In
conjunction with the Company January 20, 1997 amendment to the plan, all
options were cancelled and certain options were reissued at their original
exercise prices and compensation expense was recognized for the excess of the
fair value of the common stock over the exercise price of the related options.
The Company recognized approximately $131,000 in compensation expense for the
year ended December 31, 1997 as the vesting of the options accelerated upon
completion of the Initial Public Offering.
On December 14, 1998, the Company repriced 581,150 options outstanding,
which had exercise prices ranging between $1000 and $2675 per share to the
then market price of $900 per share. This was the Company first repricing of
options and the repricing did not benefit executive officers, affiliates, or
major shareholders.

The Company has elected to account for stock and stock rights in accordance
with APB No. 25. SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
established an alternative method of expense recognition for stock-based
compensation awards to employees based on fair values. The Company has elected
not to adopt SFAS No. 123 for expense recognition purposes.
Pro forma information regarding net income is required by SFAS No. 123 and
has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock
options under the fair value method prescribed by SFAS No. 123. The fair value
of options granted during the year ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, was
estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following weighted-average assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 456
percent and 62 percent; no dividend yield; weighted-average expected lives of
the options of five years, and expected volatility of 95 percent and 50 percent,
respectively. There were no options granted in 1996.
The Black-Scholes  option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price
characteristics that are significantly different from those of traded options.
Because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the
fair value estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock
rights.
The weighted-average fair value of options granted during 1998 and 1997,
was $784 per share and $432 per share, respectively. For purposes of pro forma
disclosures, the estimated fair value of options is amortized to expense over
the estimated service period. If the Company had used the fair value accounting
provisions of SFAS No. 123, the pro forma net loss for 1998 and 1996 would have
been approximately $19,125,000 and $2,833,000, respectively, or $214 and $052
per share basic and diluted, respectively. Pro forma net income for 1997 would
have been $1,600,000, or $026 per share basic and $025 per share diluted.
The provisions of SFAS No. 123 are not required to be applied to awards granted
prior to January 1, 1995. The impact of applying SFAS No. 123 may not
necessarily be indicative of future results.
In December 1997, under the Performance Plan, the Company granted to
several consultants options to acquire 30,000 shares of the Company common
stock in lieu of payment of certain consulting services to be performed in the
future. Pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the Company will recognize compensation
expense for the fair value of these options granted to consultants, as
calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, using the weighted
average assumptions described above. The fair value of these options at issuance
was approximately $254,000 and will be recognized ratably over the estimated
service period.

Rights Plan, which is designed to protect the rights of its stockholders and
deter coercive or unfair takeover tactics. It is not in response to any
acquisition proposal. Preferred stock                     56      STARTEC GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED
purchase rights have been granted as a dividend at the rate of one Right for
each outstanding share of Common Stock held of record as of the close of
business on April 3, 1998.
Each Right, when exercisable, would entitle the holder thereof to purchase
1/1,000th of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock Junior
Preferred Stock at a price of $175 per 1/1000th share. The Company Board of
Directors designated 25,000 shares of the authorized Preferred Stock for this
purpose. The Rights, which have no voting rights, will expire on March 25, 2008.
At the time of adoption of the Rights Plan, the Rights are neither
exercisable nor traded separately from the Common Stock. Subject to certain
limited exceptions, the Rights will be exercisable only if a person or group,
other than an Exempt Person, as defined in the Rights Plan, becomes the
beneficial owner of 10% or more of the Common Stock or announces a tender or
exchange offer which would result in its ownership of 10% or more of the Common
Stock. Ten days after a public announcement that a person has become the
beneficial owner of 10% or more of the Common Stock or ten days following the
commencement of a tender or exchange offer which would result in a person
becoming the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the Common Stock the earlier of
which is called the Distribution Date, each holder of a Right, other than the
acquiring person, would be entitled to purchase a certain number of shares of
Common Stock for each Right at one-half of the then-current market price. If the
Company is acquired in a merger, or 50% or more of the Company assets are sold
in one or more related transactions, each Right would entitle the holder thereof
to purchase common stock of the acquiring company at one half of the then-market
price of such common stock.
At any time after a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 10% or
more of the Common Stock, the Board of Directors may exchange one share of
Common Stock for each Right, other than Rights held by the acquiring person.
Generally, the Board of Directors may redeem the Rights at any time until 10
days following the public announcement that a person or group of persons has
acquired beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding Common Stock.
The redemption price is $001 per Right.
Warrant and registration rights
The Company agreed to issue to certain underwriters of the Initial Public
Offering, warrants to purchase up to 150,000 shares of Common Stock at an
exercise price of $1320 per share. The warrants are exercisable for a period of
five years beginning October 1998. The holders of the warrants will have no
voting or other stockholder rights unless and until the warrants are exercised.
The fair value of these warrants was approximately $870,000 when issued, and is
classified in stockholders' equity.

connection with debt issuances and agreements. Warrants issued in connection
with the Senior Notes and Warrants Offering have an exercise price of $2420 and

8. INCOME TAXES   The Company has net operating loss carryforwards NOLs for Federal
income tax purposes of approximately $25,483,000 and $1,878,000, as of December
31, 1998 and 1997, respectively, which may be applied against future taxable
income and expire between 2010 and 2013. The Company utilized a portion of these
NOLs to partially offset its taxable income for the year ended December 31,
1997. The use of the NOLs is subject to statutory and regulatory limitations
regarding changes in ownership. SFAS No. 109 requires that the tax benefit of
NOLs for financial reporting purposes be recorded as an asset to the extent that
management assesses the realization of such deferred tax assets is more likely
than not. A valuation reserve is established for any deferred tax assets that
are not expected to be realized.
As a result of historical and projected operating losses, a valuation
allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset was recorded for all periods
presented.                    57      STARTEC GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

quoted market prices. The fair value of the vendor financing is estimated based
on expected future payments discounted at the Company incremental borrowing
rate.
The carrying amounts for current assets, restricted cash and current
liabilities approximate their fair value due to their short maturity. The fair
value of notes payable to individuals and others and notes payable to related
parties cannot be reasonably and practicably estimated due to the unique nature
of the related underlying transactions and terms. However, given the terms and
conditions of these instruments, if these financial instruments were with
unrelated parties, interest rates and payment terms could be different than the
currently stated rates and terms.
12. ACQUISITIONS   In November 1998, the Company acquired PCI Communications, Inc. PCI for
$265 million. PCI is a provider of voice and data services located in the
Pacific Rim island of Guam.  PCI has  signatory  status on the TPC-5,
Guam-Filipinos and China-U.S. cables. The acquisition will allow Startec to
access a U.S. based satellite line of sight that extends from Southeast Asia to
Central Europe. The purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired
based upon the estimated fair value of such assets, which resulted in an
allocation of $1 million to goodwill and $250,000 to a covenant not to compete
agreement. Purchase price allocations have been completed on a preliminary basis
and are subject to adjustment should new or additional facts about the business
become known.
In December 1998, the Company acquired Global Communications GmbH of
Germany Global for $54 million.  Global has a Class IV nationwide
telecommunications license for Germany, an interconnection agreement with
Deutsche Telekom and a Siemens EWSD switch located in Dusseldorf. The purchase
