our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Mail-Well, Inc. and Subsidiaries as
of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 and for the period

MAIL-WELL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- 
1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - Mail-Well, Inc., headquartered in Englewood,
Colorado, is organized under Delaware law and its common stock is traded on
the New York Stock Exchange. Mail-Well I Corporation, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Mail-Well, Inc. conducts most of the business of Mail-Well,
Inc. Mail-Well I Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, is the owner
of the operating assets and the borrower of debt. These financial
statements include the accounts of Mail-Well, Inc., Mail-Well I Corporation
and its subsidiaries collectively referred to as the Company. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
NATURE OF OPERATIONS - The Company is one of the largest printers in North
America, manufacturing both envelopes and high impact color commercial
work. Within envelope printing, the Company competes in the consumer direct
segment in which envelopes are designed and manufactured to customer
specifications. In addition, the Company manufactures envelopes sold into
the office products market. The Company is also a leading high impact
commercial printer specializing in printing advertising literature, high-
end catalogs, annual reports, calendars and computer instruction books and
is recognized as an innovative provider of quality printed products to
leading companies in the United States. The Company commenced operations on
February 24, 1994 with the acquisition of the envelope businesses of
Georgia-Pacific Corporation GP Envelope and Pavey Envelope and Tag
Corp. Pavey.
INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING - On September 21, 1995, the Company completed an
initial public offering of 5,000,000 shares of common stock at $1400 per
share. The net proceeds of the offering, after underwriting commissions and
expenses, were approximately $644 million; the net proceeds were used to
repay bank indebtedness and repurchase the remaining Deferred Coupon Notes.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on
hand, demand deposits, and short-term investments with original maturities
of three months or less. The Company domestic banking system provides for
the daily replenishment of major bank accounts for check clearing
requirements. Accordingly, outstanding checks that had not yet been paid by
the banks at year end are reflected in accounts payable in the consolidated
balance sheets.
INVENTORIES - Inventories are generally valued at the lower of first-in,
first-out FIFO cost or market and include the cost of materials,
labor and manufacturing overhead.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - Property, plant and equipment are recorded
at cost. Replacements of major units of property are capitalized and the
replaced properties are retired. Replacements of minor units of property
and repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred.
Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is calculated using the
straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the respective
assets, as follows      Land improvements                25 years
Buildings and building improvements      15-45 years
Leasehold improvements              15 years
Machinery and equipment             15 years
Furniture and fixtures             3-10 years
Automobiles and trucks              5 years
Computers and software             3-5 years 
Depreciation for tax purposes is calculated using accelerated methods. Upon
retirement or disposition of assets, cost and accumulated depreciation are
removed from the related accounts and any gain or loss is included in income.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS - In connection with the issuance of both bank debt and public
debt as well as in connection with acquisitions, the Company recorded certain
intangible assets. The following schedule summarizes the amortization periods
and amortization expense recorded in connection with the intangible assets in
thousands                        USEFUL

Total                         $7,728 $5,148 $3,034
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS - Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is based on future net cash
flows from the use of the asset. The Company recorded no adjustment for
impairment of long-lived assets in 1995. In 1996, the Company wrote off certain
assets with a net book value of $1,014,000 which is included in the consolidated
statements of operations in the loss on disposal of assets.
NET INCOME PER SHARE - Net income per share is computed by dividing net income
by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares and common stock
equivalents. Common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding exclude
unallocated and uncommitted shares held by the Company employee stock
ownership plan ESOP.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - The financial statements include the results
of Canadian operations which are translated from Canadian dollars, their
functional currency, into U.S. dollars. The balance sheet is translated at
the year end rate of exchange. Results of operations are translated at
average rates prevailing during the year. The effects of translation at the
balance sheet date are accumulated as the cumulative foreign currency
translation adjustment in stockholders' equity.
ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
RECLASSIFICATION - Certain amounts in the 1994 and 1995 financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to 1996 presentation.
2. ACQUISITIONS
In December 1994, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of
American Envelope Company American, a manufacturer of envelopes and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of CC Industries. In July 1995, the Company acquired
all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Supremex Inc. Supremex,
a Canadian manufacturer of envelopes. In August 1995, the Company acquired
all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Graphic Arts Centers, Inc.
GAC, one of the leading high impact commercial printers in the United
States. In April 1996, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets
of Quality Park Products, Inc. QPP, a printer and manufacturer of
envelopes. In November 1996, the Company acquired substantially all of the
Canadian assets of Pac National Group PNG, a Canadian envelope
manufacturer based in Ontario. In December 1996, the Company acquired all of
the outstanding shares of Shepard Poorman Communications Corporation SP,
a high impact color printer located in Indianapolis, Indiana. The purchase
prices for PNG and SP are preliminary and adjustments may be recorded in
1997. These acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and, accordingly,
the net purchase price of each acquisition was allocated to the various
assets and liabilities according to their fair values as of the date of the
respective purchase. The presentation below summarizes the purchase price
including all adjustments made through December 31, 1996. The results of
operations of each of the acquisitions have been included in the accompanying

the GP Envelope, Pavey, American, Supremex and GAC acquisitions and the initial
public offering had occurred on January 1, 1994 and as if the QPP acquisition
had occurred on January 1, 1995. Due to the immateriality of the PNG and SP
acquisitions, their operations have not been included in the pro forma financial
information. The summary pro forma results are based on assumptions and are not
necessarily indicative of the actual results which would have occurred had these
acquisitions occurred on January 1 of the year preceding the acquisition date,
or of the future results of operations of the Company.

In November 1996, Mail-Well I Corporation amended its bank credit agreement
which now includes a $300 million revolving credit facility, $700 million of
term loans, a $300 million acquisition loans facility and a $120 million
letter of credit facility. Mail-Well I Corporation obligations under the bank
credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the domestic
subsidiaries of the Company and by 66% of the common stock of Supremex. In
November 1996, Supremex modified its bank credit agreement which now includes a
C$100 million revolving credit facility, $650 million of term loans and a
C$80 million letter of credit facility. Supremex obligations under the bank
credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company.
Borrowings under the Mail-Well I Corporation bank credit agreement bear interest
at the bank prime rate plus 05% per annum or at LIBOR plus 20% per annum, as
elected by the Company. Supremex borrowings under its bank credit agreement bear
interest at the bank Canadian prime rate plus 05% per annum or at the
Canadian Banker Acceptance discount rate plus 20% per annum, as elected by
Supremex. Outstanding letters of credit were $58 million at December 31, 1996.
Both of the bank credit agreements and the indenture to the Senior Subordinated
Notes contain certain restrictive covenants that, among other things and with
certain exceptions, limit the ability of the Company to incur additional
indebtedness, prepay subordinated debt, transfer assets outside of the Company,
pay dividends or repurchase shares of common stock. In addition to these
restrictions, the Company is required to satisfy certain financial covenants and
tests and to limit capital expenditures to amounts specified by the bank credit
agreements. The bank credit agreements also include mandatory prepayment
provisions in the event that the Company or Supremex realizes excess cash flow,
as defined in the agreements.
Interest rate cap agreements are used to reduce the potential impact of
increases in the rates on floating-rate long-term debt. At December 31, 1996 and
1995, the Company was party to two interest rate cap agreements. Agreements for
a notional value of $200 million provide an effective LIBOR interest rate cap
of 85% and expire May 16, 1997; agreements for a notional value of $350
million provide an effective LIBOR interest rate cap of 90% and expire March
31, 1997. The agreements entitle the Company to receive from counterparties the
amounts, if any, by which the Company interest payments exceed the interest
rate caps.
The Company entered into foreign currency swap contracts with a third
party to offset exposure to Canadian exchange rate fluctuations on its
U.S. dollar denominated term loans. The foreign currency swap
contracts provide that Supremex pay to the third party principal
payments denominated in fixed rate Canadian dollars and interest at
the Bankers Acceptance rate. The third party will pay the principal
payments on the U.S. dollar denominated term loans in U.S. dollars and
interest at LIBOR. At December 31, 1996, $450 million of the Supremex
term loans were hedged by a foreign currency swap contract. In January
1997, the remaining $200 million of Supremex term loans were hedged
by a foreign currency swap contract.
The interest rate cap agreements and foreign currency swap contracts
hedge transactions and balances for periods consistent with committed
exposures and do not constitute investments independent of these
exposures. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments
for trading purposes. The interest rate differential on foreign
currency swap contracts used to hedge underlying debt obligations is
reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the
swaps.
In 1995, the Company repurchased all outstanding Deferred Coupon Notes
at a total cost of $19,712,000. The Deferred Coupon Notes had a yield
to maturity of 1289% and were due February 15, 2006. In connection
with this debt extinguishment the Company recognized an extraordinary
loss of $2,412,000, net of taxes of $1,608,000.
The aggregate annual maturities for all long-term debt during the
fiscal years subsequent to December 31, 1996 are in thousands

5.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
In November 1996, the Company entered into a five year agreement
whereby it can sell, on a revolving basis, an undivided percentage
ownership interest in a designated pool of accounts receivable up to a
maximum of $1000 million. At December 31, 1996, $684 million has
been sold under this agreement and the sale has been reflected as a
reduction of accounts receivable in the Company consolidated balance
sheet. The receivables are sold at a discount of 060% above the
prevailing commercial paper rate plus certain other fees. The discount
expense of $07 million on the receivables sold has been recorded in
the Company statement of operations for the year ended December 31,
1996.
In 1996, the Company refinanced certain equipment under a
sale/leaseback arrangement. The equipment was sold for $300 million.
The transaction was accounted for as a sale whereby the property was
removed from the Company financial statements. The equipment was
then leased by the Company and is being accounted for as an operating
lease where the lease payments are based upon LIBOR plus 20%. The
total rent expense recorded in 1996 was $04 million. At the end of
the lease term, the Company has the option to repurchase the equipment
at the fair market value at that date or to pay to the purchaser $250
million. The Company records an additional rent expense that will
accrue to a total which will equal the estimated fair market value of
the equipment at the end of the lease term.
The Company leases various office, warehouse and manufacturing facilities under
operating leases. Minimum annual lease commitments at December 31, 1996 were as
follows in thousands                   
1997          $ 8,532
1998           7,996
1999           7,074
2000           6,520
2001           5,521
2002 and thereafter   11,697
Total         $47,340
Lease expense for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 and for the period
February 24, 1994 through December 31, 1994 was $6,531,000, $4,808,000 and
$1,267,000, respectively.
Property, plant and equipment under capital lease totals $3,584,000 at
December 31, 1996. Related accumulated depreciation at December 31, 1996 is
$966,000. Capital lease obligations as of December 31, 1996 are as follows in
thousands                           
Capital lease obligations       $5,814
Less: interest             2,308
Total principal obligations       3,506
Less: current maturities         548
Long-term capital lease obligations  $2,958
Total capital lease obligations during the fiscal years subsequent to December
31, 1996 are as follows in thousands                   
1997          $ 843
1998           515
1999           353
2000           389
2001           387
2002 and thereafter   3,327
Total         $5,814
The Company is involved in various lawsuits incidental to its businesses. In
management opinion, an adverse determination against the Company relating to
these suits would not be material to the consolidated financial statements. In
the case of administrative proceedings related to environmental matters
involving governmental authorities, management does not believe that any
imposition of monetary sanctions would be material.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RECEIVABLES - The carrying value of cash and
cash equivalents and receivables approximates fair value due to the short
term maturities of these investments.
LONG-TERM DEBT - The fair value of the Company long term debt to banks is
based on quoted interest rates for borrowings of similar quality and terms.
The fair value of the senior subordinated notes is based upon quoted market
prices. The fair value of capital leases is based on lease arrangements with
similar terms.
INTEREST RATE CAP AGREEMENTS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY SWAP CONTRACTS - Fair
values reflect the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to
terminate the contracts at the reporting date based on quoted market prices
of comparable contracts.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK - Financial instruments which potentially
subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist
primarily of accounts receivable. Concentrations of credit risk with respect
to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of entities
comprising the Company customer base and their dispersion across many
different industries and geographic areas. As of December 31, 1996, the
Company had no significant concentrations of credit risk as the largest
customer receivable balance was less than 51% of total receivables.
7. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND STOCK OPTION PLAN
PREFERRED STOCK - The Company authorized 25,000 shares of $001 par value
preferred stock. No shares have been issued at December 31, 1996 or 1995.
STOCK OPTION PLAN - During 1994, the board of directors approved the adoption
of a stock option plan which provided for the grant of options to purchase up
to 355,250 shares of Company common stock to directors and key employees
selected by the compensation committee. During 1995, the board of directors
increased the number of options under the stock option plan by 284,200 to
639,450. The stock options granted in 1995 and 146,500 of the stock options
granted in 1996 vest over a four year period and expire over a maximum period
of ten years from the grant date. The remaining stock options granted in 1996
were made to directors of the Company and vested immediately. They are
exercisable six months after the date of grant and expire ten years from the
grant date or upon termination of directorship. The stock options granted to
the directors are subject to shareholder approval at the Company annual
meeting on May 7, 1997. The exercise price of
all options granted equals or exceeds the fair market value of the Company
common stock on the date of grant.                                          WEIGHTED

The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees and related Interpretations in accounting for its stock option plan.
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized. Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS
123 was issued and, if fully adopted by the Company, would change the method
for recognition of cost. Under SFAS 123, cost is based upon the fair value of
each option at the date of grant using an option-pricing model that takes into
account as of the grant date the exercise price and expected life of the option,
the current price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility, expected
dividends on the stock and the risk-free interest rate for the expected term of
the option. Had compensation cost been determined based on the guidance in SFAS
123, the Company net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to
the pro forma amounts indicated below. The weighted average fair values of
options granted in 1996 and 1995 were $515 and $174, respectively.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions used for
grants on March 1, 1995, May 8, 1996 and October 1, 1996, respectively: dividend
yield of 0 percent for all grants; expected volatility of 33%, 38% and 44%; 
risk-free interest rates of 72%, 62% and 67%; and expected lives of 5 and 6 
years for the March 1, 1995 options, 4 years for the May 8, 1996 options and 5 
and 6 years for the October 1, 1996 options.                                1996        1995

9.  BENEFIT PLANS
U.S. PENSION PLANS - The Company sponsors three noncontributory defined
benefit pension plans under collective bargaining agreements with unions
representing certain employees in the U.S. The Company also has obligations
under a noncontributory defined benefit plan, which was curtailed in 1994.
The continuing plans provide for benefits based on either a percentage of
pay or a dollar multiplier, and years of credited service. Pension costs
are funded so as to meet minimum funding requirements under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Pension assets are invested
primarily in bank common trust funds.
Accumulated plan benefits for all plans exceed plan assets. The following table
summarizes the funded status of the plans and the related amounts that are
recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31 in thousands                                1996     1995
Actuarial present value of benefit obligations:
Vested benefit obligation                  $4,306    $3,868
Nonvested benefit obligation                  617     638

Projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets      808    2,256
Unrecognized prior service costs                161    174
Unrecognized net gain loss                    3     727
Additional minimum liability                   222     517
Accrued pension cost                     $ 872    $1,872
The provisions of SFAS No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, require the
recognition of an additional minimum liability for each defined benefit plan for
which the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds plan assets. This amount has
been recorded as a long-term liability with an offsetting intangible asset.
Because the asset recognized may not exceed the amount of unrecognized prior
service cost and transition obligation on an individual plan basis, the balance,
net of tax benefits, is reported as a separate reduction of stockholders' equity
at December 31, 1996 and 1995, as follows in thousands                     1996  1995

Rate of compensation increase          40%  40%  40 Certain other U.S. employees covered by union agreements are included
in multi-employer pension plans to which the Company makes contributions in
accordance with the contractual union agreements. Such contributions are made
on a monthly basis in accordance with the requirements of the plans and the
actuarial computations and assumptions of the administrators of the plans.
Contributions to such multi-employer plans were $721,000, $151,000 and $0 for
1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Benefits and net asset data for these
multi-employer pension plans for union employees are not available.
CANADIAN PENSION PLANS - Supremex maintains five defined benefit
pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees who have bargained
for such benefits. Supremex policy is to contribute annually at least the
minimum amount required by law. Pension funds are invested primarily in mutual
funds. The actuarial present value of accumulated benefits related to
Supremex plans at December 31, 1996 and 1995 was $34,193,000 and $12,632,000,
respectively, compared with net assets available for benefits of $25,660,000 and
$13,952,000 at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Included in the
consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 1996 and 1995 are pension
liabilities for the Supremex plans of $412,000 and $394,000, respectively.
Net pension expense for the Supremex defined benefit pension plans
included the following components in thousands                          1996   1995

Rate of compensation increase          50%   50 
EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN - In 1994, the Company established an ESOP for
certain U.S. employees. The ESOP borrowed monies from the Company to purchase
1,298,848 shares of Company common stock. These shares are held in trust and are
issued to employees' accounts in the ESOP as the loan is repaid. The loan
obligation of the ESOP is considered unearned employee benefit expense and, as
such, is recorded as a reduction of the Company stockholders' equity. The
Company contributions to the ESOP are used to repay the loan principal and
interest. Both the loan obligation and the unearned benefit expense are reduced
by the amount of loan principal repayments made by the ESOP. Amounts charged to
expense are based on the average market value of shares allocated to
participants and were $1,973,000 and $1,612,000 for the years ended December 31,
1996 and 1995 and $752,000 for the period from February 24, 1994 through
December 31, 1994.
At December 31, 1996 and 1995 the ESOP held the following shares of common
stock                               1996    1995
Shares allocated to participant accounts          412,116  194,708
Shares committed to be allocated to participant
accounts in connection with current year contribution   185,823  217,408
Unallocated shares held for future years contributions   700,909  886,732
Total                           1,298,848 1,298,848
The fair market value of the unallocated shares of common stock held for future
contributions was $11,477,000 and $10,565,000 at December 31, 1996 and 1995,
respectively.
401K PLANS - The Company has three employee savings plans which are designed
to qualify under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. All U.S. salaried
and non-union hourly employees who meet the eligibility requirements are covered
under one of these plans. In addition, U.S. employees covered by union
agreements where these benefits have been collectively bargained are also
covered by one of these plans. Each of the plans allows eligible employees to
make salary reduction contributions. The provisions of certain plans include
mandatory or discretionary contributions by the Company. Amounts charged to
expense in connection with Company contributions were $1,620,000 and $1,656,000
for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, and $694,000 for
the period from February 24, 1994 through December 31, 1994.
PROFIT DISTRIBUTION PLAN - The Company has established a Profit Distribution
Plan covering full time employees and executive officers of certain
subsidiaries. The Profit Distribution Plan is administered by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors. Amounts paid under the Profit Distribution
Plan are based on the Company financial performance. Distributions under the
Profit Distribution Plan of $1,268,000 and $1,312,000 were expensed for the
years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, and $500,000 was expensed
for the period from February 24, 1994 through December 31, 1994.
