To The Ultimate Software Group, Inc.     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The
Ultimate Software Group, Inc. a Delaware corporation and formerly The Ultimate
Software Group, Ltd., a Florida limited partnership and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity deficit and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1998. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Ultimate
Software Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. s/ Arthur Andersen LLP

41        THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.    NATURE OF OPERATIONS
The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. the Company or, prior to the
transactions consummated in April 1996 as further discussed below, The Ultimate
Software Group, Ltd. the Partnership, designs, markets, implements and
supports technologically advanced, cross-industry human resource management and
payroll software solutions, marketed primarily to middle-market organizations
with 500 to 15,000 employees. The Company reaches its customer base and target
market through its direct sales force and a network of national, regional and
local strategic partners.
In April 1996, the Company completed a series of transactions the
Transactions whereby the businesses of certain third-party resellers of the
Company products were purchased by the Partnership, and the business and
operations of the Partnership, along with the acquired businesses, were
transferred and conveyed to the Company in exchange for certain shares of Class
A and Class B Common Stock of the Company. The acquisitions were accounted for
under the purchase method of accounting. See Note 12. The Company issued shares
of its Class B Common Stock in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding
shares of the capital stock of the Partnership general partner, The Ultimate
Software Group, Inc., a Florida corporation GP, and for all of the issued
and outstanding shares of the capital stock of Strategic Image Systems, Inc.
Strategic, a limited partner of the Partnership. Such exchange was accounted
for on a historical cost basis as GP and Strategic were related to the
Partnership. As a result of the Transactions, GP and Strategic became
wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company. For a more detailed description of the
Transactions, see Note 10.
2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.
In February and March 1998, the Company acquired the businesses of five
third-party resellers of the Company products the Acquired Resellers in
exchange for an aggregate of 121,856 shares of the Company Class B Common
Stock, converted into 1,233,061 shares of the Company common stock, par value
$01 per share the Common Stock in connection with the initial public
offering discussed in Note 3. The Company accounted for these transactions
using the poolings-of-interest method of accounting. Therefore the accounts of
the Acquired Resellers have been included retroactively in the consolidated
financial statements as if the companies had operated as one entity since
inception. See Note 15.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
All highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months
or less when acquired are considered cash equivalents. The accompanying
consolidated balance sheets include $166 million and $15 million in
interest-bearing accounts as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
42 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
Accounts receivable are principally from end-users of the Company
products. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers and
has recorded allowances for estimated losses.
A rollforward of allowances for doubtful accounts is as follows in
thousands                                   FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment is depreciated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which range
from three to five years. Leasehold improvements and assets under capital leases
are amortized over the shorter of the life of the asset or the term of the lease
over periods ranging from three to five years. Maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense when incurred; betterments are capitalized. Upon the sale or
retirement of assets, the cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization are
removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company licenses software under noncancellable license agreements
and provides services including maintenance, implementation, training and
consulting services. In accordance with the provision of Statement of Position
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, license revenues are generally
recognized when a noncancellable license agreement has been signed, the product
has been shipped, no significant vendor obligations remain and collection of the
related receivable is considered probable. Revenues from maintenance agreements
for maintaining, supporting and providing periodic updates are recognized
ratably over the maintenance period, which in most instances is one year.
Revenues for training and consulting services are recognized as services are
performed.
Prior to 1996, the Company entered into 18 exclusive reseller
agreements with third parties, which provided each such party with exclusive
distribution rights to sell the Company products in a specified territory. In
consideration, the Company received an up-front nonrefundable fee, which ranged
from $25,000 to $300,000. Such fees were recognized as revenues, at the time an
agreement was executed. In 1996 and 1995, the Company bought back, or otherwise
reacquired, the distribution rights of 13 of its resellers. As of December 31,
1997, the Company had five third-party resellers, the businesses of which were
subsequently acquired in 1998. See Notes 10 and 15.
The Company also generates revenues relating to the sale of
payroll-related forms and the printing of Form W-2 for certain customers. Such
revenues are recognized as the product is shipped or as the services are
rendered.
Until 1997, substantially all of the Company revenues were derived
from its UltiPro for Lan product and related services. The Company has shifted
its focus from a product based on DOS and local area                     43 network Lan technologies, UltiPro for Lan, to a product based on Windows and
client/server technologies, UltiPro HRMS/Payroll. As a result of this shift and
the decrease in general market demand for DOS-based products, the Company
revenues from its UltiPro for Lan product declined to an immaterial amount in
1998. While the Company still derives revenues from the support, service and
limited sales of the UltiPro for Lan product line, its UltiPro HRMS/Payroll
product and related support and services are expected to continue to account for
substantially all of the Company revenues for the foreseeable future as the
Company no longer actively markets the DOS-based product. As a percentage of
total license revenues, revenues derived from UltiPro for Lan were 16%, 414%
and 1000% in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
DEFERRED REVENUE
Deferred revenue is comprised of deferrals for i license revenues for
which product has not yet been delivered or obligations have not yet been
fulfilled in the case of committed upgrades and ii service revenues for
which maintenance, implementation, training and consulting services have not yet
been rendered.
As of December 31, 1998 and 1997, $221,000 and $1,717,000,
respectively, of deferred revenue will be recognized in periods after the years
ending December 31, 1998 and 1999.
Associated deferred costs, relating to commissions, were $388,000 and
$330,000 at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Commission expense is
recognized in the period the related revenue is recognized.
COST OF REVENUES
The cost of revenues consists of cost of license revenues and cost of
service revenues. Cost of license revenues primarily consists of fees payable to
a third party for software products distributed by the Company. Cost of service
revenues primarily consists of costs to provide consulting, implementation,
maintenance, technical support and training to the Company customers, the cost
of providing periodic updates and costs related to sales of payroll-related
forms.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes were not provided for, or payable, by the Partnership.
Partners were taxed individually on their share of Partnership earnings.
Subsequent to the Transactions discussed in Note 10, the Company is subject to
corporate Federal and state income taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes
under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109. SFAS 109 provides for a
liability approach under which deferred income taxes are provided based upon
enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the taxes become
payable.
ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES
Acquired intangibles were amortized on a straight-line basis over 30
months, the estimated useful life of such acquired assets primarily consisting
of customer lists and personnel. In accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment Of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of, the Company continually evaluates whether later events and circumstances
have occurred that indicate the remaining acquired intangibles may warrant
revision or may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that goodwill should
be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the
related business' undiscounted cash flows from operations over the remaining
life of the cost in excess of net assets of acquired businesses, in measuring
whether such cost is recoverable. Operating results as well as projected future
cash flows relating to the resellers acquired during 1996 indicated an
impairment in acquired intangibles as of December 31, 1997 and 1996.
Accordingly, the Company charged additional amounts of                     44 308,000 and $5,050,000 to amortization of acquired intangibles in 1997 and
1996, respectively, to reduce acquired intangibles to their estimated realizable
value. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $638,000, $1,442,000 and
$6,932,000 in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. As of December 31, 1998,
acquired intangibles were fully amortized.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold,
Leased or Otherwise Marketed, requires capitalization of certain software
development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility.
Based on the Company product development process, technological feasibility is
established upon completion of a working model. Costs incurred by the Company
between the achievement of technological feasibility of the Company products
and the point at which the product is ready for general release have
historically substantially coincided, and, as a result, software development
costs required to be capitalized have been immaterial. As of December 31, 1998,
capitalized software costs totaled $53,000. There were no capitalized software
costs as of December 31, 1997.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company financial instruments, consisting of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and borrowings approximate
fair value due to their short-term nature.
ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
As permitted by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS 123, the Company continues to account for stock-based compensation
using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and has made the pro
forma disclosures required by SFAS 123 for each of the three years ended in the
period ended December 31, 1998. See Note 9.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, became effective in the fourth
quarter of 1997 and requires two presentations of earnings per share--basic
and diluted. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available
to common stockholders the numerator by the weighted average number of common
shares the denominator for the period. The computation of diluted earnings per
share is similar to basic earnings per share, except that the denominator is
increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been
outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued.
45     The following options to purchase shares of common stock were
outstanding during each year, but were not included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share because the Company reported a net loss for all years
presented and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive                       1998        1997       1996
Number of options            2,104,562     1,748,735     768,123
Weighted average
exercise price             $689       $627      $516     For the Company, earnings per share under SFAS No. 128 for each of the
three years ended December 31, 1998 was the same as if it were computed in
accordance with the prior rule due to the antidilutive nature of the potential
common stock equivalents. See Note 2 and Note 9 for more information regarding
earnings per share and options to purchase Common Stock, respectively.
Basic and diluted loss per share for all periods presented include the
impact of the subsequent conversion of shares of Preferred and Common Stock
outstanding as described in Notes 10 and 17, effected for the stock split
discussed in Note 3.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
In 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, SFAS 130 which establishes standards for the reporting and display
of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of financial
statements. The objective of SFAS 130 is to report a measure comprehensive
income of all changes in equity of an enterprise that result from transactions
and other economic events in a period other than transactions with owners. The
adoption of SFAS 130 did not have a material impact on the Company
consolidated financial statements since there are no material differences
between comprehensive income, as defined in SFAS 130, and the Company net loss
for all periods presented.
SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, SFAS 131 effective December 31, 1998.
SFAS 131 establishes standards for the way that public companies report selected
information about operating segments in annual interim financial reports to
shareholders. It also establishes standards for related disclosures about an
enterprise business segments, products, services, geographic areas and major
customers. The Company operates its business as a single segment. As a result,
no additional disclosure was required.
46 RECENT ACCOUNTING STATEMENTS
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, SFAS 133 was issued in June 1998 and is effective for the
Company fiscal year ending December 31, 2000. SFAS 133 establishes accounting
and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded on the
balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value. The
Company believes that the adoption of SFAS 133 will have no material impact on
its financial statements as it has entered into no derivative contracts and has
no current plans to do so in the foreseeable future.
In March 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ACSEC issued SOP 98-1,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use SOP 98-1. SOP 98-1 establishes criteria for determining which
costs of developing or obtaining internal-use computer software should be
charged to expense and which should be capitalized. The Company will adopt SOP
98-1 prospectively effective January 1, 1999. The Company does not believe that
the adoption of SOP 98-1 will have a material effect on the Company financial
position or results of operations.
3.    INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
On June 5, 1998, the Company completed the sale of 3,250,000 shares of
the Company common stock, par value $01 the Common Stock, in an initial
public offering at an offering price of $10 per share the IPO. Prior to the
closing of the IPO, the Company Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock, Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and
Class C Common Stock were converted into Common Stock. In connection with the
IPO, the Company effected a 10119-for-1 stock split of the issued and
outstanding shares of the Common Stock. All references to Common Stock amounts,
shares and per share data have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to the
stock split.

In September 1996, the Company entered into a line of credit with a
bank the Working Capital Line for the lesser of $4,000,000 or 80% of
eligible receivables, as defined. The Working Capital Line was increased to the
lesser of 80% of the eligible receivables as defined or $60 million for the
period beginning April 23, 1998 and ending September 30, 1998. The Working
Capital Line was further amended, to extend the agreement to November 30, 1999
with available borrowings equivalent to the lesser of $4,000,000 or 80% of
eligible receivables, as defined. The Working Capital Line bears interest at
LIBOR plus 4875% per annum 9885% and 10875% at December 31, 1998 and 1997,
respectively, but not less than 8000% per annum in any month. Interest on the
Working Capital Line is payable monthly. No amounts were outstanding under the
Working Capital Line as of December 31, 1998 and 1997. The Working Capital Line
is renewable for successive one-year terms, unless either party elects to
terminate the agreement. The Working Capital Line is collateralized by
substantially all of the Company assets.
The Company had a $200,000 line of credit with a bank bearing interest
at prime plus 10% 95% at December 31, 1997, payable quarterly through
maturity. The line matured in January 1998 and was collateralized by the
accounts receivable of a subsidiary of the Company. The amount outstanding under
the line of credit was $109,000 as of December 31, 1997.
The Company had $130,000 available under another line of credit
agreement with a bank bearing interest at 90% per annum. As of December 31,
1997, $100,000 was outstanding under the line of credit which was repaid in
1998.
8.    INCOME TAXES
No provision for federal and state income taxes has been recorded as
the Company has incurred net operating losses. At December 31, 1998, the Company
has approximately $27,400,000 of net operating loss carryforwards for federal
income tax reporting purposes available to offset future taxable income. The
carryforwards expire through 2018. Utilization of such net operating losses may
be limited as a result of cumulative ownership changes in the Company equity
instruments.
The components of the net deferred tax assets included in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets are as follows in thousands                     AS OF DECEMBER 31,
1998     1997
Net operating losses         $ 10,700   $ 8,091

Valuation allowance          11,184    9,817
Net deferred income tax assets    $   -   $   -
The Company has provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax
assets as realization of such amounts is not considered more likely than not.
The Company reviews the valuation allowance requirement periodically and makes
adjustments as warranted.
No pro forma adjustments to reflect income tax benefits have been
included in the accompanying statements as it is management belief that
realization of such amounts do not meet the criteria required by generally
accepted accounting principles.
49 9.    STOCK OPTIONS
The Company has adopted The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. Nonqualified
Stock Option Plan the Plan under which the Company is authorized to issue
options to purchase a total of 5,059,500 shares of the Company Common Stock to
directors, officers and employees of the Company. Under the Plan, options to
purchase shares of Common Stock may be granted at prices equal to the market
value of shares of the Company Common Stock as of the date of grant, or at
such other amount as may be determined by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors appointed to administer the Plan the Committee. The
Committee has discretion under the Plan to prescribe vesting periods for options
which are granted under the Plan. In addition, options granted under the Plan
become immediately exercisable in the event of a change in control of the
Company and in certain other circumstances. The maximum term of the options
granted under the Plan is 10 years.
The Plan provides that non-employee members of the Company Board of
Directors shall receive options in lieu of any retainer or meeting fees for
serving on the Board or committees thereof. Such options vest upon the date of
grant and have an exercise price equal to 30% of fair market value of the
Company Common Stock on the date of grant. The Company has accounted for such
options in accordance with the requirements prescribed in SFAS 123 with a total
non-cash charge of $31,000 and zero in 1998 and 1997, respectively.
A summary of the Company Plan as of December 31, 1998 and 1997 and
changes during the years then ended, is presented below: WEIGHTED AVERAGE                                    WEIGHTED

At December 31, 1998, the weighted average contractual life of options
outstanding was 104 months.
50     Pro forma information is required by SFAS 123 for options issued to
employees and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its
stock-based compensation plan under the fair value method. The fair value of
each option granted was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for
grants: risk-free interest rates of 50%-55% for 1998 and 64%-67% for 1997
and 1996, dividend yield of 0% for all three years presented, expected
volatility of 65% in 1998 and 1997 and 01% in 1996 and an expected life of 3-6
years for each of the three years presented. The Company pro forma information
is as follows in thousands, except per share amounts                         FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK
PREFERRED STOCK
During 1998, the Company authorized for future issuance a total of
2,500,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $01 par value, including the 500,000
shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock discussed below.
SERIES A JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK
In October 1998, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a
Stockholder Rights Plan the Rights Plan in which one preferred stock
purchase right was distributed as a dividend for each share of Common Stock held
of record as of the close of business on November 15, 1998 the Right or,
collectively, the Rights.
The Rights are exercisable only if a person or group acquires
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company outstanding Common Stock or
commences or announces a tender offer which would result in such person or group
beneficially owning 15% or more of the Company outstanding Common Stock. Each
Right entitles the holder to buy one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock for $45.
The Rights Plan has certain anti-takeover effects. The Rights will
cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the
Company on terms not approved by the Board of Directors.
SERIES A AND SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
Pursuant to Board action taken in the second calendar quarter of 1998
following the occurrence of the Release Event see Note 17 the Board

The shares of the Class A, Class B and Class C Common Stock were
subject to mandatory conversion into shares of Common Stock if the Board of
Directors of the Company declared a mandatory conversion following the
occurrence of a Release Event. Pursuant to the Board Action, each outstanding
share of Class A, Class B and Class C Common Stock was converted into shares of
the Company Common Stock.
COMMON STOCK
Shares of Common Stock were issued upon the conversion of shares of the
other classes of Common and Preferred Stock and no shares of Common Stock were
issued prior to any such conversion.
The holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share for each
share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders.
ESCROW AGREEMENTS
All of the 236,300 shares of Class A Common Stock issued in connection
with the Transactions were placed in escrow pursuant to an escrow agreement
between the Partnership and the Company the Class A Escrow Agreement to be
held until the occurrence of a Release Event. Upon the occurrence of a Release
Event, the Class A Escrow Agreement required the Partnership to return to the
Company for cancellation any shares of Class A Common Stock that the Partnership
was not entitled to retain under a formula that generally measured i the
revenues of the Participating Resellers during a recent 12 month period
preceding the Release Event, against ii the total revenues of the Company in
the same 12 month                     52 period. In March 1998, 68,747 of the shares of Class A Common Stock which were
converted into 1,030,398 shares of Common Stock held under the Class A Escrow
Agreement were released to the Partnership and the remaining 167,553 shares of
Class A Common Stock held in the Class A Escrow were surrendered to the Company
and cancelled. See Note 17.

purchase i 1,230 shares of the Company Common Stock for $278 and ii 3,688
shares of the Company Common Stock for $233 in exchange for services
rendered. Such options are currently exercisable and were valued on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Assumptions used in valuing
such options are discussed in Note 9. The related expense was $31,000 and is

PRODUCT LIABILITY
Software products such as those offered by the Company frequently
contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions
are released. Testing of the Company products is particularly challenging
because it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing environments
in                     53 which the Company customers may deploy these products. Despite extensive
testing, the Company from time to time has discovered defects or errors in
products. There can be no assurance that such defects, errors or difficulties
will not cause delays in product introductions and shipments, result in
increased costs and diversion of development resources, require design
modifications or decrease market acceptance or customer satisfaction with the
Company products. In addition, there can be no assurance that, despite testing
by the Company and by current and potential customers, errors will not be found
after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of or delay in
market acceptance, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company
business, operating results and financial condition.
LITIGATION
From time-to-time, the Company is involved in litigation relating to
claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business. The
Company is not currently a party to any legal proceeding the adverse outcome of
which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company business, operating results and
financial condition.
