REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apollo Group, Inc.   In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the 
related consolidated statements of operations, of changes in shareholders' 
equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of Apollo Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries at August 31, 
1998 and 1997, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for 
each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 1998, in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements 
are the responsibility of Apollo Group, Inc. management; our responsibility 
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally 
accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are 
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We 
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed 
above.

NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apollo and 
its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances 
have been eliminated.
Cash and cash equivalents 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an 
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
Restricted cash 
The U.S. Department of Education the DOE requires that Title IV 
Program funds collected for unbilled tuition be kept in a separate cash or 
cash equivalent account until the students are billed for that portion of 
52
their program. In addition, all Title IV Program funds received by the 
Company through electronic funds transfer are subject to certain holding 
period restrictions. These funds generally remain in these separate accounts 
for an average of 60-75 days from date of receipt. Restricted cash is 
excluded from cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statement of Cash 
Flows until the cash is transferred from these restricted accounts to the 
Company operating accounts. The Company restricted cash is invested 
primarily in U.S. Agency-backed securities and auction market preferred stock 
with maturities of ninety days or less. 
Investments  
Investments in marketable securities such as municipal bonds, auction 
market preferred stock and U.S. agency obligations are stated at amortized 
cost, which approximates fair value. It is the Company intention to hold 
its marketable securities until maturity. Investments in joint ventures and 
other long-term investments are carried at cost.
Property and equipment 
Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated 
depreciation. The Company capitalizes the cost of software used for internal 
operations once technological feasibility of the software has been 
demonstrated. Such costs consist primarily of custom-developed and packaged 
software and the direct labor costs of internally developed software. 
Depreciation is provided on all buildings, furniture, equipment and related 
software using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 
the related assets which range from three to seven years, except software 
which is depreciated over three to five years and buildings which are 
depreciated over 30 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the 
straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated 
useful lives of the related assets. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as 
incurred.
Revenues, receivables and related liabilities 
The Company educational programs range in length from one-day seminars 
to degree programs lasting up to four years. Long-term degree programs are 
billed in blocks of time ranging in length from five weeks to three months. 
Seminars, other shorter term programs and many of the College non-degree 
programs are usually billed in one installment. Billings occur when the 
student first attends a session resulting in the recording of a receivable 
and deferred tuition revenue for the amount billed. The deferred tuition 
revenue is recognized into income pro rata over the period of instruction. 
If a student withdraws from a course or program, the unearned portion of the 
program that the student has paid for is refunded in accordance with the 
Company refund policy. 
Because most of the Company educational programs at UOP, IPD and WIU 
are billed in short blocks of time ranging from five to six weeks, most 
deferred tuition revenue at the end of each period will be recognized into 
income within five to six weeks following the end of that period. Many of 
the College non-degree programs are billed in one installment and will be 
recognized into income over 8 to 36 months. Any deferred tuition revenue 
that will not be recognized into income within 12 months is classified as 
long-term deferred tuition revenue.
53
Student deposits consist of payments made in advance of billings. As 
the student is billed, the student deposit is applied against the resulting 
student receivable.
The Company does not record the unbilled portion of educational programs 
for existing students because the students are not usually financially 
obligated for the unbilled portion. A majority of these students do, 
however, remain in their programs until completion.
Cost in excess of fair value of assets purchased    The Company amortizes costs in excess of fair value of assets purchased 
on a straight-line method over the estimated useful life. At August 31, 
1998, the Company cost in excess of fair value of assets purchased related 
primarily to the acquisition of certain assets of the College for Financial 
Planning and Western International University Western, which are being 
amortized over 35 years and 15 years, respectively.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 121, Accounting for the 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, 
requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not 
be recoverable. The carrying value of cost in excess of fair value of assets 
purchased is assessed for any permanent impairment by evaluating the 
operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying 
businesses. Adjustments are made if the sum of the expected future net cash 
flows is less than book value. As of August 31, 1998, there have been no 
impairment adjustments recognized.
Fair value of financial instruments 
The carrying amount reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for cash 
and cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, accounts 
receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and student deposits and 
deferred revenue approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of 
these financial instruments.
Earnings per share 
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number 
of Class A and Class B Common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted 
net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of Class A 
and Class B common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the 
period. Both basic and diluted weighted average shares have been 
retroactively restated for stock splits effected in the form of stock 
dividends. The amount of any tax benefit to be credited to capital related 
to the exercise of options and disqualifying dispositions under the Company 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan is included when applying the treasury stock 
method to stock options in the computation of earnings per share. 
Deferred rental payments and deposits 
The Company records rent expense using the straight-line method over the 
term of the lease agreement. Accordingly, deferred rental liabilities are 
provided for lease agreements that specify scheduled rent increases over the 
lease term. Rental deposits are provided for lease agreements that specify 
payments in advance or scheduled rent decreases over the lease term.
54
Selling and promotional costs 
The Company expenses selling and promotional costs as incurred. Selling 
and promotional costs include marketing salaries, direct-response and other 
advertising, promotional materials and related marketing costs. Advertising 
expenses, including promotional materials, were $300 million in 1998, $218 
million in 1997 and $163 million in 1996.
Start-up costs 
Costs related to the start-up of new campuses and learning centers are 
expensed as incurred and were $72 million in 1998 and $36 million in 1997 
and 1996.
Income taxes 
Deferred income taxes have been provided for all significant temporary 
differences. These temporary differences arise principally from compensation 
not yet deductible for tax purposes, limitations on bad debt deductions, 
long-term deferred tuition revenue recognized upon receipt of payment for tax 
purposes and the use of accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes.
Stock-based compensation 
The Company has elected to continue to account for its stock-based 
awards in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and has provided the pro forma 
disclosures as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123, 
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation SFAS 123, for the years ended 
August 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996.
New accounting pronouncements 
During June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 130, Reporting Comprehensive 
Income SFAS 130, which will be effective in the Company 1999 fiscal 
year. Under SFAS 130, companies are required to report comprehensive income 
as a measure of overall performance. Comprehensive income includes all 
changes in equity during a reporting period, except those resulting from 
investments by owners and distributions to owners. The Company will be 
required to report net income and foreign currency translation adjustments as 
components of comprehensive income. 
During June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 131, Disclosure about Segments 
of an Enterprise and Related Information SFAS 131, which will be 
effective in the Company 1999 fiscal year. SFAS 131 redefines how 
operating segments are determined and requires expanded quantitative and 
qualitative disclosures relating to an entity operating segments. The 
Company does not anticipate that the adoption of SFAS 131 will have a 
significant impact on its disclosures. 
In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 
issued Statement of Position No. 98-1 SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs 
of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. SOP 98-1 will 
be effective for the Company 2000 fiscal year. The Company does not expect 
that the adoption of SOP 98-1 will have a material impact on its financial 
statements.

Use of estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the 
date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these 
estimates.
Consolidated statement of cash flow 
Supplemental schedule of non-cash investing activities   In September 1997, the Company purchased certain assets of the College 
for Financial Planning. Non-cash consideration paid included the issuance of 
$159 million of common stock. As a result of the acquisition, the Company 
recorded additional assets of $467 million and liabilities of $114 million.
In September 1995, the Company purchased certain assets of Western. As 
a result of the acquisition, the Company recorded additional assets of $20 
million and liabilities of $24 million.
Reclassifications 
Certain amounts reported for the years ended August 31, 1997 and 1996 
have been reclassified to conform to the 1998 presentation, having no effect 
on net income.
NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS
In September 1997, the Company acquired the assets and related business 
operations of the College for Financial Planning and related divisions that 
include the Institute for Wealth Management, the Institute for Retirement 
Planning, the American Institute for Retirement Planners, Inc. and the 
Institute for Tax Studies. The adjusted purchase price consisted of $194 
million in cash, $159 million in stock and the assumption of approximately 
$114 million in liabilities. The excess of cost over the value of tangible 
assets of $400 million is being amortized over 35 years.
In September 1995, the Company completed the acquisition of certain 
assets of Western International University Western. Western was a 
private non-profit educational institution incorporated in 1978 that was 
accredited by NCA. The Company formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary called 
Western International University, Inc. WIU as the holding company for the 
net assets acquired from Western. The adjusted purchase price consisted of 
$630,000 in cash and the assumption of approximately $24 million in 
liabilities. The excess of cost over the value of tangible assets of $26 
million is being amortized over 15 years.
The acquisitions were both accounted for under the purchase method and, 
accordingly, the results of operations related to these new subsidiaries have 
been included with those of the Company for periods subsequent to the date of 
the respective acquisitions. Results of operations for Western and for the 
College for Financial Planning prior to the acquisition were not material in 
relation to the Company operations as a whole.

Net deferred tax assets                 $ 4,767   $2,168
In light of the Company history of profitable operations, management 
has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will 
ultimately realize the full benefit of its deferred tax assets related to 
future deductible items. Accordingly, the Company believes that a valuation 
allowance is not required for its net deferred tax assets.

NOTE 9. COMMON STOCK
From August 1995 to April 1998, the Company Board of Directors 
authorized four separate stock splits effected in the form of stock dividends 
as follows:
For Shareholders
Date Authorized   Type     of Record on      Date Distributed
-           August 25, 1995   3-for-2   September 8, 1995   September 22, 1995

April 9, 1998    3-for-2   April 13, 1998     April 27, 1998
All Common Stock amounts, Common Stock prices and earnings per share 
figures for periods prior to the stock splits, which were effected in the 
form of stock dividends, have been restated to reflect the effect of all 
previous stock splits except for the number of shares outstanding and the 
related impact on the stated value of Class A Common Stock and additional 
paid-in capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Shareholders' Equity.
On September 25, 1998, the Company Board of Directors authorized a 
program allocating up to $40 million in Company funds to repurchase shares of 
its Class A Common Stock. As of October 16, 1998, the Company had 
repurchased approximately 295,000 shares at a total cost of approximately 
$70 million.
NOTE 10. EARNINGS PER SHARE
In February 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards 128, Earnings Per Share. As a result, earnings per share 
calculations for all prior periods have been restated.
A reconciliation of the basic and diluted per share computations for 
1998, 1997 and 1996 are as follows                        For the Year Ended August 31,

NOTE 11. EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR BENEFIT PLANS
The Company provides various health, welfare and disability benefits to 
its full-time salaried employees which are funded primarily by Company 
contributions. The Company does not provide post-employment or post-
retirement health care and life insurance benefits to its employees. 
401kPlan 
The Company sponsors a 401k plan which is available to all employees 
who have completed one year and at least 1,000 hours of continuous service. 
The Company matches 100% of the contributions from the first $10,000 of a 
participant annual pre-tax earnings. Contributions from the participant 
earnings in excess of $10,000 are matched by the Company at 185%. 
Participant contributions are subject to certain restrictions as set forth in 
the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matching contributions totaled $18 
million, $13 million and $11 million for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
Stock Based Compensation Plans 
The Company has three stock-based compensation plans that were adopted 
in 1994: the Apollo Group, Inc. Director Stock Plan Director Stock Plan, 
the Apollo Group, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, and the Apollo 
Group, Inc. 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Purchase Plan. 
The Director Stock Plan currently provides for an annual grant to the 
Company non-employee directors of options to purchase shares of the 
Company Class A Common Stock on September 1 of each year. Under the LTIP, 
the Company may grant options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation 
rights and other stock-based awards to certain officers or key employees of 
the Company. Many of the options granted under the LTIP vest 25% per year 
starting at the end of the year 2002. The vesting may be accelerated for 
individual employees if the stock price reaches defined goals for at least 
three trading days and if certain profit goals, defined for groups of 
individuals, are also achieved. 
The Purchase Plan allows employees of the Company to purchase shares of 
the Company Class A Common Stock at quarterly intervals through periodic 
payroll deductions. The purchase price per share, in general, is 85% of the 
lower of: 1 the fair market value as defined in the Purchase Plan on the 
enrollment date into the respective quarterly offering period, or 2 the fair 
market value on the purchase date. 
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, Accounting 
for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for 
its stock-based compensation, and has adopted the disclosure-only provisions 
of SFAS 123. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for these 
plans. Had compensation cost for the plans been determined based on the fair 
64
value at the grant date consistent with SFAS 123, the Company net income, 
income per share and weighted average shares outstanding would have been as 
follows, in thousands except per share amounts                         Year Ended August 31

not necessarily indicative of future amounts. The fair value of each option 
grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes method with 
the following weighted-average assumptions for grants in 1998, 1997, and 
1996, respectively: 1 dividend yield of 000% in all years; 2 expected 
volatility of 400%, 370%, and 371%; 3 risk-free interest rates of 59%, 
60%, and 57% and 4 expected lives of 54, 69, and 83 years.

UOP most recent Department of Education program review began in March 
1997, and an initial program review report has been received. This report 
contained six findings in the areas of satisfactory academic progress, 
refunds and general program administration. UOP is currently in the process 
of responding to these findings regarding compliance with requirements of the 
Title IV Programs. UOP response to these issues is due in January 1999, 
and UOP will have its response prepared prior to the deadline. Subsequently, 
the Department will issue a final program review determination. It is 
uncertain when the final determination will be issued and what the results of 
the findings will be.
Additionally, in January 1998 the Department of Education Office of the 
Inspector General OIG began performing a routine audit of UOP. The 
auditors reviewed UOP cash management policies. Although no draft report 
has been received from the OIG, the audit team indicated at the exit 
interview that it had no findings regarding cash management policies. The 
team did present questions regarding UOP interpretation of the 12-hour 
rule, UOP distance education programs and institutional refund 
obligations. As of this date, UOP has supplied the OIG with the information 
they have requested and is awaiting an initial draft report. Although the 
Company believes that the program review and OIG audit will be resolved 
without any material effect, as with any program review or audit, no 
assurance can be given as to the final outcome since the matters are not yet 
resolved.
As previously disclosed, the Company assumed the Title IV liabilities of 
Western International University Western which were subject to change 
based on the results of the DOE audit of Western Title IV Programs. 
Although much of the fieldwork was completed in early 1996, the final audit 
results and the amount that the Company is responsible for has not been 
determined by the DOE at the current time. Depending on the interpretation 
67
of the various regulatory requirements, the final audit results and the 
Company liability may differ materially from the estimates currently 
recorded. Any difference between the final amount and the estimates 
currently recorded will be recorded as an increase or decrease, as 
applicable, to expense.
The Company is involved in various legal proceedings occurring in the 
normal course of business. The Company believes that the disposition of 
these cases will not have a material adverse impact on the financial position 
or results of operations of the Company. Item 1. Business                             3
