Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and presentation.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company internal control over
financial reporting as of December 30, 2006. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in INTERNAL CONTROL INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK. Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of
December 30, 2006, the Company internal control over financial reporting is
effective based on those criteria.
Management assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting as of December 30, 2006, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the
independent registered public accounting firm which also audited the Company
consolidated financial statements. Ernst & Young attestation report on
management assessment of the Company internal control over financial
reporting appears on page 27 hereof. s/ James F. Wright                   /s/ Anthony F. Crudele

26       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS
TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY
We have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying
Management Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting, that Tractor
Supply Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 30, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Tractor Supply
Company management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, management assessment that Tractor Supply Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in
our opinion, Tractor Supply Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006,
based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of
Tractor Supply Company as of December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2006 and our report
dated February 26, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

27       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS
TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tractor Supply
Company as of December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2006. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tractor Supply
Company at December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and the consolidated results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 30, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006 the
Company changed its method of accounting for share-based compensation using the
modified-prospective method.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Tractor Supply
Company internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006,
based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated February 26, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

32          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES NATURE OF BUSINESS
Tractor Supply Company the Company, we and/or our is the largest
operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States. We are focused on
supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who
enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses. Stores are
located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.
At December 30, 2006, we operated 676 retail farm and ranch stores in 37 states
and one Canadian province.
FISCAL YEAR
Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the
calendar year. The fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 consists of 53 weeks
while the fiscal years ended December 30, 2006 and December 25, 2004 consist of
52 weeks.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
SEGMENT INFORMATION
In accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information, Tractor Supply Company has one reportable industry
segment - the operation of farm and ranch retail stores.
MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES
Our preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States inherently
requires estimates and assumptions by us that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
Significant estimates and assumptions by management primarily impact the
following key financial statement areas     REVENUE RECOGNITION AND SALES RETURNS
We recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of
merchandise or receives services. If we receive payment before the
customer has taken possession of the merchandise as per our layaway
program, the revenue is deferred until the sale is complete. Revenues
from the sale of gift cards are deferred and recognized upon redemption.
We estimate a liability for sales returns based on a one-year rolling
average of historical return trends and we believe that our estimate for
sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated
with past sales. Our estimation techniques have been consistently
applied from year to year, however, as with any estimates, refunds
activity may vary from estimated amounts. Estimated sales returns are
shown net, as a reduction in gross margin in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. At December 30, 2006 we had a liability of $32
million reserved for sales returns, compared to $30 million at December
31, 2005.
INVENTORY VALUATION
IMPAIRMENT RISK
We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating
turn rates, sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels
and other benchmarks. The estimated inventory valuation reserve to
recognize any impairment in value i.e. an inability to realize the full
carrying value is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation
indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising
strategies. We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to
significant risk of obsolescence in the near term. However, changes in
market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the
need for additional reserves.
33          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     SHRINKAGE
Our stores perform physical inventories once a year and we have
established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical
inventory counts. This is done by assessing the chain-wide average
shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods' sales
volumes. Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most
recent individual store experiences.
VENDOR SUPPORT
We receive funding from our vendors for the promotion of our brand as
well as the sale of their products. Vendor funding is initially deferred
as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as
a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold, in
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 02-16, Accounting by a
Customer Including a Reseller for Certain Consideration Received from
a Vendor EITF 02-16.
The amount of expected funding is estimated based upon initial
guaranteed commitments, as well as anticipated purchase levels with
applicable vendors. The estimated purchase volume and related vendor
funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales
trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store
openings and relocations. Although we believe we have the ability to
reasonably estimate purchase volume and related vendor funding, it is
possible that actual results could significantly differ from the
estimated amounts.
FREIGHT
We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in
connection with inventory purchases and distribution. Such costs are
included as a component of the overall cost of inventories and
recognized as a cost of merchandise sold as inventory is sold.
During 2006, we refined our method of estimating the freight cost
component of inventory based on changes in our business and operating
environment which included a change in mix of goods, an increased level
of importing and rapidly increasing fuel costs. This refinement provides
a more appropriate matching of freight cost incurred with inventory and
cost of merchandise sold. This change in estimate increased the
inventory value and reduced cost of merchandise sold by approximately
$29 million, or $04 per diluted share for fiscal 2006.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
We have share-based compensation plans covering certain members of management
and non-employee directors. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payments using the
modified prospective transition method. See Note 2.
We estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant utilizing
a modified BLACK-SCHOLES option pricing model. The BLACK-SCHOLES option
valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-term
traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
However, key assumptions used in the BLACK-SCHOLES model are adjusted to
incorporate the unique characteristics of our stock option awards. Option
valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions including
expected stock price volatility and expected life. We rely on historical
volatility trends to estimate future volatility assumptions. Other assumptions
required for estimating fair value with the BLACK-SCHOLES model are the expected
risk-free interest rate and expected life of the option. The risk-free interest
rates used were actual U.S. Treasury zero-coupon rates for bonds matching the
expected term of the option on the date of grant. The expected life of the
option on the date of grant was estimated based on our historical experience for
similar options.
In addition to the key assumptions used in the Black Scholes model, the
estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation which is based on historical
experience for similar options is a critical assumption, as it reduces expense
ratably over the vesting period. We adjust this estimate annually, based on the
extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the
previous estimate.
We believe our estimates are reasonable in the context of actual historical
experience. The impact of adopting SFAS 123R on future results will depend on,
among other matters, levels of share-based payments granted in the future,
actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises.
34          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SALES TAX RESERVE
A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers. We obtain exemption
information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction. Many of the
states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance
with applicable sales tax laws. The business activities of our customers and the
intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex
environment of compliance. These circumstances also create some risk that we
could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance. While we
believe we reasonably enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and
endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be
no assurance that we, upon final completion of such audits, would not have a
significant liability for disallowed exemptions.
We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to
determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance. Any estimated
liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our to-date
experience with each audit. As each audit progresses, we quantify the exposure
based on preliminary assessments made by the state auditors, adjusted for
additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment. The
reserve for these tax audits can fluctuate depending on numerous factors,
including the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, ambiguity in state
tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to
settle with the state taxing authorities.
INSURANCE RESERVES
We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers'
compensation and general liability insurance plans. We have stop-loss insurance
policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values
$200,000 for employee health insurance claims, $350,000 for workers'
compensation and $250,000 for general liability. The full extent of certain
claims, especially workers' compensation and general liability claims, may not
become fully determined for several years. Therefore, we estimate potential
obligations for liabilities that have been incurred but not yet reported based
upon historical data, experience, and use of outside actuarial consultants.
Although we believe the reserves established for these obligations are
reasonably estimated, any significant increase in the number of claims or costs
associated with claims made under these plans could have a material adverse
effect on our financial results. At December 30, 2006, we had recorded net
insurance reserves of $219 million, compared to $190 million at December 31,
2005.
GIFT CARDS
We have a gift card program and we issue merchandise return cards for certain
return transactions. The gift cards do not expire and the merchandise return
cards expire after one year. As such, we recognize a benefit when: i the gift
card or merchandise return card is redeemed by the customer; or ii the
likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote referred
to as breakage or iii the unredeemed merchandise returns cards expire one
year from issuance. The gift card breakage rate is based upon historical
redemption patterns and a benefit is recognized for unredeemed gift cards in
proportion to those historical redemption patterns.
We recognized a benefit of $24 million and $03 million in fiscal 2006 and
2005, respectively. Of the $24 million recognized in the current year, $21
million or $03 per diluted share was due to a modification of the estimation
of redemption assumptions based on an analysis of historical redemption
patterns. This benefit has been included as a reduction in selling, general and
administrative expenses and is reflected as a reduction of other accrued
expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
CREDIT CARDS/ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
Sales generated through our private label credit cards are not reflected as
accounts receivable. Under an agreement with Citi Commerce Solutions, a division
of Citigroup Citigroup, consumer and business credit is extended directly to
customers by Citigroup. All credit program and related services are performed
and controlled directly by Citigroup.
35          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRE-OPENING COSTS
Non-capital expenditures incurred in connection with opening new store and
distribution centers are expensed as incurred.
STORE CLOSING COSTS
We continuously evaluate the performance of our stores and periodically close
those that are under-performing. We recognize store closing costs in accordance
with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 146,
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal
activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, usually in the period the
store closes.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Temporary cash investments, with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents. The majority of payments due
from banks for customer credit card transactions process within 24-48 hours and
are accordingly classified as cash and cash equivalents.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term
receivables and payables and long-term debt instruments, including capital
leases. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and trade
payables equal current fair value. The terms of our revolving credit agreement
the Credit Agreement include variable interest rates, which approximate
current market rates.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated using the lower of last-in, first-out LIFO cost or
market. Inventories are not in excess of market value. Quarterly inventory
determinations under LIFO are based on assumptions as to projected inventory
levels at the end of the fiscal year, sales for the year and the rate of
inflation/deflation for the year. If the first-in, first-out FIFO method of
accounting for inventory had been used, inventories would have been
approximately $203 million and $142 million higher than reported at December
30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively.
VENDOR CONCENTRATION
Approximately 170 vendors accounted for 80% of our purchases for fiscal 2006,
with no one vendor representing more than 10% of purchases during the year.
WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS
Costs incurred at our distribution centers for receiving, warehousing and
preparing product for delivery are expensed as incurred. These costs are
included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated
Statements of Income at the time the costs are incurred.
36          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is recorded using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Improvements
to leased premises are amortized using the straight-line method over the initial
term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is lesser.
Leasehold improvements added late in the lease term are amortized over the term
of the lease including the first renewal option, if the renewal is reasonably
assured or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is lesser. The
following estimated useful lives are generally applied                               Life
Buildings                    30 - 35 years
Leasehold and building improvements        5 - 15 years
Furniture, fixtures and equipment         5 - 10 years
Computer software and hardware          3 - 5 years
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS
The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development
of software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful life of the software, which is three to five years. These costs
are included in Computer software and hardware in the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Certain software costs not meeting the criteria for
capitalization are expensed as incurred.
LEASES
Assets under capital leases are amortized in accordance with our normal
depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term regardless of
renewal options, if shorter, and the related charge to operations included in
depreciation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Certain leases include rent increases during the initial lease term. For these
leases, we recognize the related rental expense on a straight-line basis over
the term of the lease which includes the pre-opening period of construction,
renovation, fixturing and merchandise placement and record the difference
between the expense charged to operations and amounts paid as a rent liability.
We occasionally receive reimbursements from landlords to be used towards
improving the related store to be leased. Reimbursements are primarily for the
purpose of performing work required to divide a much larger location into
smaller segments, one of which we will use for our store. This work could
include the addition of demising walls, separation of plumbing, utilities,
electric work, entrances front and back and other work as required. Leasehold
improvements are recorded at their gross costs including items reimbursed by
landlords. Related reimbursements are amortized on a straight-line basis as a
reduction of rent expense over the initial lease term.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
We conduct a quarterly evaluation of long-lived assets for impairment or
whenever circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be
recoverable. We apply the provisions of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets to assets held for sale.
Impairments on long-lived assets are valued on an asset-by-asset basis and
recognized by reducing the carrying value of the related assets to their fair
value less costs to sell, as appropriate, when the criteria have been met for
the assets to be classified as held for sale or disposal.
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
In accordance with SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are
measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an
impairment exists.
37          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In the current year, we reduced goodwill by $21 million resulting from a final
determination that this value related to acquired intangible assets, primarily
the trade name of DEL'S FARM SUPPLY. Intangible assets are included in other
assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The weighted average
estimated life of the intangible assets is approximately 171 years. We
recognized $07 million in amortization expense related to intangible assets
during fiscal 2006.
ADVERTISING COSTS
Advertising costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with newspaper
circulars, television and radio, as well as direct mail, newspaper
advertisements and other promotions. Costs are expensed when incurred with the
exception of television advertising and circular and direct mail promotions,
which are expensed upon first showing. Advertising expenses for fiscal 2006,
2005 and 2004 were approximately $532 million, $474 million and $422 million,
respectively. Prepaid advertising costs were approximately $15 million and $16
million at December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively.
INCOME TAXES
We account for income taxes using the liability method, whereby deferred tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the
enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are
expected to be recovered or settled.
NET INCOME PER SHARE
As provided by SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share, basic earnings per share is
calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income
by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Diluted shares are computed
using the treasury stock method for options.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial
statements into U.S. dollars are included in the foreign currency translation
adjustment, a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders'
equity. The assets and liabilities of our store in British Columbia, which was
acquired as part of the acquisition of the assets of Del, are translated into
United States dollars at year-end rates of exchange, while revenues and expense
items are translated at average rates for the period.
NOTE 2 - SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payments, using
the modified prospective method and began recognizing compensation expense for
share-based payments based on the fair value of the awards. Share-based payments
include stock option grants and certain transactions under our other stock
plans. SFAS 123R requires share-based compensation expense recognized the
beginning of fiscal 2006 to be based on the following: a grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123 for unvested
options granted prior to the adoption date; b grant date fair value estimated
in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R for all share-based payments
granted subsequent to the adoption date; and c the discount on shares sold to
employees subsequent to the adoption date, which represents the difference
between the grant date fair value and the employee purchase price.
For fiscal 2006, the adoption of the SFAS 123R fair value method resulted in
share-based compensation expense a component of selling and general and
administrative expenses related to our stock plans that we would not have
recognized had we continued to account for share-based compensation under APB 25
defined below. For fiscal 2006, this share-based compensation expense lowered
pre-tax income by $97 million, and net income by $61 million or $15 per
diluted share. SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in
excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow
rather than as an operating cash flow, as required prior to adoption of SFAS
123R.
38          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based payments using the
intrinsic-value-based recognition method prescribed by Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, APB 25. As
options were granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant, no stock-based employee
compensation cost was reflected in net income prior to adopting SFAS 123R. As
we adopted SFAS 123R under the  method, results
from prior periods have not been restated.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share
as if we applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to options
granted under our stock plans in all periods presented in thousands. For
purposes of this pro forma disclosure, the value of the options is estimated
using a modified BLACK-SCHOLES option pricing model for all option grants.

Under SFAS 123R, forfeitures are estimated at the time of valuation and reduce
expense ratably over the vesting period. This estimate is adjusted periodically
based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to
differ, from the previous estimate. Under SFAS 123 and APB 25, we elected to
account for forfeitures at the time of valuation and reduce the pro-forma
expense ratably over the period.
Effective May 4, 2006, we adopted the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, which replaced
the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan. Following the adoption of the 2006 Stock
Incentive Plan, no further grants may be made under the 2000 Stock Incentive
Plan.
Under our 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, options may be granted to officers,
non-employee directors and other employees. The per share exercise price of
options granted shall not be less than the fair market value of the stock on the
date of grant and such options will expire no later than ten years from the date
of grant. In the case of a stockholder owning more than 10% of the outstanding
voting stock of the Company, the exercise price of an incentive stock option may
not be less than 110% of the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant
and such options will expire no later than five years from the date of grant.
Also, the aggregate fair market value of the stock with respect to which
incentive stock options are exercisable on a tax deferred basis for the first
time by an individual in any calendar year may not exceed $100,000. Vesting of
options commences at various anniversary dates following the dates of grant.
Under the terms of the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, a maximum of 2,750,000 shares
are available for grant as stock options or other awards. At December 30, 2006,
we had 2,736,971 shares available for future equity awards under the Company
2006 Stock Incentive Plan.
39          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The fair value of each option grant is separately estimated for each vesting
date. The fair value of each option is recognized as compensation expense
ratably over the vesting period. We have estimated the fair value of all stock
option awards as of the date of the grant by applying a modified BLACK-SCHOLES
pricing valuation model. The application of this valuation model involves
assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of
compensation expense. The weighted averages for key assumptions used in
determining the fair value of options granted during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
as well as a summary of the methodology applied to develop each assumption, are
as follows                              FISCAL YEAR

Dividend  00%     00%     00     EXPECTED PRICE VOLATILITY -- This is a measure of the amount by which a
price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate. We use actual
historical changes in the market value of the stock to calculate
expected price volatility because we believe that this is the best
indicator of future volatility. Prior to July 2006, we calculated weekly
market value changes from the date of grant over a past period
representative of the expected life of the options to determine
volatility. Beginning in July 2006, we calculated daily market value
changes from the date of grant over a past period representative of the
expected life of the options to determine volatility. An increase in the
expected volatility will increase compensation expense.
RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE -- This is the U.S. Treasury rate for the week
of the grant having a term equal to the expected life of the option. An
increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation
expense.
WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED LIVES -- This is the period of time over which
the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on
historical experience. Options granted generally have a maximum term of
ten years. An increase in the expected life will increase compensation
expense.
FORFEITURE RATE -- This is the estimated percentage of options granted
that are expected to be forfeited or cancelled before becoming fully
vested. This estimate is based on historical experience. An increase in
the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense.
DIVIDEND YIELD -- We have not made any dividend payments nor do we plan
to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. An increase in the dividend
yield will decrease compensation expense.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP whereby all our employees
have the opportunity to purchase, through payroll deductions, shares of common
stock at a 15% discount. Pursuant to the terms of the ESPP, we issued 38,354,
42,065 and 41,282 shares of common stock during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The total cost related to the ESPP, including the compensation
expense calculation under SFAS 123R, was approximately $430,000, $247,000 and
$220,000 in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 30, 2006,
there were 3,346,057 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under
the ESPP.
There were no significant modifications to the Company share-based
compensation plans during fiscal 2006 provided that, as noted above, the
Company adopted its 2006 Stock Incentive Plan in replacement of its 2000 Stock
Incentive Plan, effective May 4, 2006.
NOTE 3 - ACQUISITION OF DEL'S FARM SUPPLY On November 10, 2005, the Company acquired the assets of privately-held Del
Farm Supply, Inc. Del for $176 million including 16 stores and the
assumption of certain liabilities. Based in Lakewood, Washington, Del now
operates 18 stores, primarily in the Pacific Northwest, that offer a wide
selection of products tailored to those who enjoy the rural lifestyle. Del
specializes in the equine, animal and pet category. The purchase price was
preliminarily allocated as follows in thousands           Inventory..     $ 4,300
Current assets..       803
Fixed assets..      1,500
Goodwill..      12,400
Current liabilities      1,400
$ 17,603
The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired were estimated at
December 31, 2005 due to the time it takes to obtain pertinent information to
finalize the acquired company balance sheet frequently with implications for
the price of the acquisition. Upon completion of the Company procedures, the
initial estimates related to goodwill were revised see Note 1.
42          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 4 - CREDIT AGREEMENT In August 2002, we entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A.,
as agent for a lender group the Credit Agreement, allowing us to borrow up
to $155 million. The Credit Agreement was subsequently amended on January 28,
2004 and September 30, 2004 and replaced on February 22, 2007 see below. Both
amendments included changes to certain financial covenants, primarily to provide
flexibility for capital expenditures, and extended the maturity to February 27,
2008. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement at
December 30, 2006 and $82 million at December 31, 2005. The balance of funds
available under the Credit Agreement may be utilized for borrowings and up to
$50 million for letters of credit, of which $249 million and $121 million were
outstanding at December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. These
letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory. The
Credit Agreement bears interest at either the bank base rate 825% at
December 30, 2006 or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate LIBOR 532% at
December 30, 2006 plus an additional amount ranging from 075% to 15% per
annum, adjusted quarterly based on our performance 075% at December 30, 2006.
We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee ranging from
020% to 035% per annum 020% at December 30, 2006 and adjusted quarterly
based on our performance, on the average daily unused portion of the credit
line. There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the Credit
Agreement.
The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictions regarding additional
indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees,
investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with
subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens. In addition, we must comply with certain
quarterly restrictions based on a rolling four-quarters basis regarding net
worth, leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage, current ratio requirements and
spending limits on capital expenditures. We were in compliance with all
covenants at December 30, 2006.
In February 2007, we entered into a new Senior Credit Facility with largely the
same lender group as under the Credit Agreement. The new Senior Credit Facility
provides for borrowings up to $250 million with sublimits of $75 million and
$10 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively. This
agreement is unsecured and has a five-year term, with proceeds expected to be
used for working capital, capital expenditures and share repurchases. Borrowings
will bear interest at either the bank base rate or LIBOR plus an additional
amount ranging from 035% to 090% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our
performance 050% at February, 2007. We will also be required to pay a
commitment fee ranging from 006% to 018% per annum for unused capacity.
This new agreement eliminates the capital expenditures, net worth and current
ratio requirements from the previous Credit Agreement and requires quarterly
compliance with respect to fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios.
NOTE 5 - LEASES We lease the majority of our office space and retail store locations, certain
distribution centers, transportation equipment and other equipment under various
noncancellable operating leases. The leases have varying terms and expire at
various dates through 2029 and 2025 for capital leases and operating leases,
respectively. Store leases typically have initial terms of between 10 and 15
years, with two to four optional renewal periods of five years each. Some leases
require the payment of contingent rent that is based upon store sales above
agreed upon sales levels for the year. The sales levels vary for each store and
are established in the lease agreements. Generally, most of the leases also
require that we pay associated taxes, insurance and maintenance costs.
Total rent expense for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was approximately $1043
million, $833 million and $680 million respectively. Total contingent rent
expense for fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004 was insignificant.

NOTE 10 - RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS We have a defined contribution benefit plan, the Tractor Supply Company 401k
Retirement Savings Plan the Plan, which provides retirement and other
benefits for our employees. Employees become eligible at the first quarterly
entry period following their fulfillment of the eligibility requirements. To be
eligible, an employee must be at least 21 years of age, have completed 12 months
of employment, and performed 1,000 hours of service in a year of service as
defined by the Plan. We match in cash 100% of the employee elective
contributions up to 3% of the employee eligible compensation plus 50% of the
employee elective contributions from 3% to 6% of the employee eligible
compensation. In no event shall the total Company match made on behalf of the
employee exceed 45% of the employee eligible compensation. All current
contributions are immediately 100% vested. Company contributions in years prior
to 2000 did not vest immediately and accordingly, as certain employees leave
employment with the Company, they may forfeit a portion of their employer match.
Company contributions, net of forfeitures, to the Plan during fiscal 2006, 2005
and 2004, were approximately $2,278,000, $1,805,000 and $1,772,000,
respectively.
46          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We offer, through a deferred compensation program, the opportunity for certain
qualifying employees to elect a deferral of up to 40% of their annual base
salary and up to 100% of their annual incentive bonus under their respective
incentive bonus programs. To be eligible for the salary deferral, each
participant must contribute the maximum amount of salary to the Tractor Supply
Company 401k Retirement Savings Plan subject to the Company match. Under the
deferred compensation program, the participants' salary deferral is matched by
the Company, 100% on the first $3,000 of base salary contributed and 50% on the
next $3,000 of base salary contributed limited to a maximum annual matching
contribution of $4,500. Each participant account earns simple annual interest
at the prime rate as in effect on January 1 each year. Each participant is fully
vested in all amounts credited to their deferred compensation account. Payments
under the program, which are made in cash and paid in ten annual installments or
in a single lump sum payment at the election of the participant, are made within
30 days following the earlier of the participant i death, ii retirement,
iii total and permanent disability, iv separation from service, or v some
other date designated by the participant at the time of the initial deferral.
The Company contributions, including accrued interest, were $403,305, $257,000
and $173,000 for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
NOTE 11 - MOVE OF CORPORATE FACILITY In July 2004, the Company relocated its existing Store Support Center to
consolidate multiple headquarter facilities within one facility. The Company
recognized incremental after-tax costs of approximately $21 million primarily
related to remaining facility and technology lease obligations and other moving
costs.
NOTE 12 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES CONSTRUCTION COMMITMENTS
We had commitments for new store construction projects totaling approximately
$76 million at December 30, 2006.
LITIGATION
We are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of
business. After consultation with legal counsel, we expect these matters will be
resolved without material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
or results of operations. Any estimated loss related to such matters has been
adequately provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably
estimable. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any
particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in
circumstances relating to these proceedings.
NOTE 13 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In February 2007, we entered into a new Senior Credit Facility with largely the
same lender group as under the Credit Agreement. The new Senior Credit Facility
provides for borrowings up to $250 million with sublimits of $75 million and
$10 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively. This
agreement is unsecured and has a five-year term, with proceeds expected to be
used for working capital, capital expenditures and share repurchases. Borrowings
will bear interest at either the bank base rate or LIBOR plus an additional
amount ranging from 035% to 090% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our
performance. We will also be required to pay a commitment fee ranging from 006%
to 018% per annum for unused capacity. This new agreement eliminates the
capital expenditures, net worth and current ratio requirements from the previous
Credit Agreement and requires quarterly compliance with respect to fixed charge
coverage and leverage ratios.
Also in February 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase
program which provides for repurchase of up to $250 million of the Company
outstanding stock over an approximate three-year period. The repurchases may be
made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program
will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory
requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions. Repurchased
shares will be held in treasury. The program may be limited or terminated at any
time without prior notice.
47          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 14 - IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R is a revision
of SFAS 123 and supersedes APB 25. Among other items, SFAS 123R eliminates the
use of the intrinsic value method of accounting and requires companies to
recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of
equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards. Pro
forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard. We adopted
SFAS 123R in fiscal 2006, as required see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information.
HOW TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES
SHOULD BE PRESENTED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT
In March 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a consensus on
EITF Issue No. 06-3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement That Is,
Gross Versus Net Presentation, which allows companies to adopt a policy of
presenting taxes in the income statement on either a gross or net basis. Taxes
within the scope of this EITF would include taxes that are imposed on a revenue
transaction between a seller and a customer, for example, sales taxes, use
taxes, value-added taxes, and some types of excise taxes. EITF 06-3 is effective
for interim and annual reporting periods beginning in fiscal 2007. EITF 06-3
will not impact the method for recording and reporting these sales taxes in our
Consolidated Financial statements as our policy is to exclude all such taxes
from revenue.
ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES
In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -- an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 FIN 48 to create a single model to
address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This Interpretation
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the
financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes. This Interpretation prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a
tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial
statements. Tax positions that meet a more-likely-than-not recognition
threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be
recognized. We will adopt FIN 48 in fiscal 2007, as required. We currently
estimate a charge to retained earnings of approximately $2 million to be
recognized as the cumulative effect of adoption. Additionally, we anticipate the
adoption of this pronouncement to increase our effective income tax rate in
fiscal 2007 by approximately 60 basis points.
48 Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

Item 2. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
-  EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We carried out an evaluation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended the 1934 Act, under the supervision and with the participation of
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15e of the 1934 Act, as of December 30,
2006. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer concluded that, as of December 30, 2006, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.
MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

CHANGE IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are
reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial
reporting.
