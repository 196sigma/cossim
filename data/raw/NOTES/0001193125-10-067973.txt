BJS WHOLESALE CLUB, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1.
Summary of Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements of BJs Wholesale Club, Inc.
BJs or the Company or we include the financial statements of all of the Companys subsidiaries, all of whose common stock is wholly owned by the Company. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January31. The fiscal years ended January30, 2010,January31, 2009 and February2, 2008 each included 52 weeks. Estimates Included in Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities We consider highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments
with maturities exceeding three months are classified as marketable securities. We had no marketable securities at January30, 2010 and January31, 2009. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable consist primarily of credit card
receivables and vendor rebates and allowances and are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $10 million at January30, 2010 and $11 million at January31, 2009. The determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts is
based on BJs historical experience applied to an aging of accounts and a review of individual accounts with a known potential for write-off. Merchandise Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost,
determined under the average cost method, or market. We recognize the write-down of slow-moving or obsolete inventory in cost of sales when such write-downs are probable and estimable. We recognize a reserve for inventory shrinkage for the period
between physical inventories based on historical results of previous physical inventories, shrinkage trends or other judgments management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Property is depreciated by use of the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. Buildings are depreciated over 331/3 years. Leasehold costs and improvements are amortized over the
required lease term which includes renewal periods that are reasonably assured or their estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. Leasehold costs and improvements that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near
the beginning of the lease term are amortized over the term that includes the required lease term and renewal periods that are reasonably assured, or their estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. Furniture, fixtures and equipment are
depreciated over three to ten years. Interest related to the development of buildings is capitalized to the extent that debt is incurred during the construction period. 
34 Table of Contents
We capitalize certain computer software costs incurred in connection with developing or
obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included in furniture, fixtures, and equipment and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally three to seven years.
Normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Impairment of Long-lived Assets We review the realizability of our long-lived assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Current and expected operating
results and cash flows and other factors are considered in connection with our reviews. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long-lived assets, the recoverability test is performed using undiscounted net cash flows of individual clubs
and consolidated net cash flows for long-lived assets not identifiable to individual clubs. Impairment losses are measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the impaired assets. We recorded pretax asset impairment charges of $494,000 in 2009, $131,000 in 2008, and $357,000 in 2007 to write down leasehold improvements
and certain fixtures and equipment to fair value at underperforming clubs that were projected to have cash flow losses. The fair value of the assets was based primarily on past experience in disposing of similar assets. Asset impairment charges are
included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Self-Insurance Reserves We are primarily self-insured for workers compensation and general liability claims. Reported reserves for these claims are derived
from estimated ultimate costs based upon individual claim file reserves and estimates for incurred but not reported claims. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from the sale of merchandise, net of estimated returns, at the time
of purchase by the customer in the club. In the limited instances when the customer is not able to take delivery at the point of sale, revenue from the sale of merchandise is not recognized until title and risk of loss pass to the customer. For
sales of merchandise on our website, revenue is also recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which is normally at the time the merchandise is received by the customer. Membership fee revenue is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the life of the membership, which is typically twelve months. The Companys Rewards members qualify for a 2%
reward which can only be redeemed at BJs clubs, up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at BJs. The Company accounts for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified
within other current liabilities. The reduction in sales for the fiscal years ended January30, 2010,January31, 2009, and February2, 2008, and the related liability as of those dates were as follows:  2009

Rewards earned 21,483 18,337 17,100
Liability for unredeemed rewards 7,922 6,431 5,898 Gift cards are
available for purchase at all of our clubs. We do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards and gift cards do not have an expiration date. Revenue from gift card sales is recognized upon redemption of the gift card. We record revenue from
gift card breakage when the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and we do not have a legal obligation to escheat the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions. 
35 Table of Contents
Warranty Programs We pass on any manufacturers warranties to our customers. In addition, we offer an extended warranty on tires sold at our clubs, under
which BJs customers receive tire repair services or tire replacement in certain circumstances. We have insured this liability through a third party and, therefore, retain no liability in connection with the tire warranty program other than for
the premiums paid to the third-party carrier. As we are the primary obligor in these arrangements, associated revenue is deferred and amortized over the warranty period. We also offer extended warranties on certain types of products such as
electronics and jewelry. These warranties are provided by a third party at fixed prices to BJs. We retain no liability to satisfy warranty claims under these arrangements. We are not the primary obligor under these warranties, and as such
record revenue on these arrangements at the time of sale. Revenue from all warranty sales is included in Other revenues on the income statement. Presentation of Sales Tax Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities In the ordinary course of business, we collect sales tax on items purchased by our members that are taxable in the jurisdictions when the purchases take place. These taxes are then remitted to the
appropriate taxing authority. We exclude these taxes collected from revenues in our financial statements. Vendor Rebates
and Allowances We receive various types of cash consideration from vendors, principally in the form of rebates, based on
purchasing or selling certain volumes of product, time-based rebates or allowances, which may include product placement allowances or exclusivity arrangements covering a predetermined period of time, price protection rebates and allowances for
retail price reductions on certain merchandise, and salvage allowances for product that is damaged, defective or becomes out-of-date. We recognize such vendor rebates and allowances based on a systematic and rational allocation of the cash
consideration offered to the underlying transaction that results in progress by BJs toward earning the rebates and allowances, provided the amounts to be earned are probable and reasonably estimable. Otherwise, rebates and allowances are
recognized only when predetermined milestones are met. We recognize product placement allowances as a reduction of cost of sales in the period in which we complete the arranged placement of the product. Time-based rebates or allowances are
recognized as a reduction of cost of sales over the performance period on a straight-line basis. All other vendor rebates and allowances are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the merchandise is sold or otherwise disposed. 
We also receive cash consideration from vendors for demonstrating their products in the clubs and for advertising their products,
particularly in the BJs Journal, a publication sent to a subset of BJs members periodically throughout the year. In both cases, such cash consideration is recognized as a reduction of selling, general and administrative
SGA expenses to the extent it represents a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable SGA costs incurred by BJs to sell the vendors products. If the cash consideration exceeds the costs being
reimbursed, the excess is characterized as a reduction of cost of sales. Cash consideration for product demonstrations is recognized in the period during which the demonstrations are performed. Cash consideration for advertising vendors
products is recognized in the period in which the advertising takes place. Manufacturers Incentives Tendered by
Consumers We record consideration from manufacturers incentives such as rebates or coupons in net sales when the
incentive is generic and can be tendered by a consumer at any reseller and we receive direct reimbursement from the manufacturer, or clearinghouse authorized by the manufacturer, based on the face value of the incentive. If these conditions are not
met, we record such consideration as a decrease in cost of sales. 
36 Table of Contents
Rent Expenses Rent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases. We begin
recognizing rent expense in the preopening period when we take possession of the property. Our owned buildings, including those located on leased land, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 331/3 years. We calculate rent for ground leases over periods that equal
or exceed the time periods for depreciation of the buildings, which would include reasonably assured lease renewal periods. Preopening Costs Preopening costs consist of direct incremental costs of opening or relocating a facility and
are charged to operations as incurred. Advertising Costs Advertising costs generally consist of promoting new memberships and new store openings and also typically include television and radio
advertising some of which is vendor-funded. BJs expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expenses were less than 035% of net sales in each of the last three years. Legal Costs Legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are recognized at the same time that the loss contingency meets the criteria to be recorded. Stock-Based Compensation As of January30, 2010, we had one stock-based employee compensation plan, which is described more fully in Note 7. We recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis, measured at fair value of
an award on the date of grant, over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. The fair value of an option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of a
restricted stock award is the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Compensation cost is recognized net of estimated forfeitures. We evaluate the need to change our forfeiture estimates at the end of each quarter. Most of BJs stock option awards specify that eligible participants whose employment terminates on or after their normal retirement
date as defined may exercise options within the period of one year following their termination. Shares continue to become exercisable during this period in accordance with the stock option agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, options are not
exercisable after the end of the contractual term of the option. For awards issued after January29, 2006, with these retirement eligibility provisions, we recognize compensation cost over the employees nominal vesting period but consider
the award vested when the employees retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service, which results in an acceleration of one years compensation cost. Awards issued prior to January29, 2006, are
expensed over the nominal vesting period and do not accelerate upon the employee meeting the retirement eligible provisions. If we applied our current accounting methodology to awards issued prior to January29, 2006, post-tax share-based
compensation expense would have decreased by $06 million in 2008 and $07 million in 2007. We elected the Short
Cut method under current stock compensation accounting guidance ASC 718 to calculate our historical pool of windfall tax benefits. The gross amount of windfall tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options is reported in the
financing activities section of the cash flow statement. If applicable, gross tax shortfalls are classified in the operating activities section of the cash flow statement.

Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amount of long-term debt, including current installments, was $1,148,000 and $1,715,000 as of January30, 2010 and
January31, 2009, respectively. The fair value of this debt was $1,194,000 and $1,817,000 as of January30, 2010 and January31, 2009, respectively. Fair value was based on our estimate of current rates on debt with similar remaining
maturities for companies with credit ratings similar to BJs. New Accounting Pronouncements  In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued new guidance on fair value measurements. The guidance defines
fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The FASB deferred the effective date of this guidance for one year for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities except those that are
recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually. As such, we partially adopted the guidance effective February3, 2008. The partial adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial
statements. We adopted the remaining provisions effective February1, 2009. The guidance affects the way that we calculate fair value when conditions exist that require us to impair long-lived assets; however, this adoption did not have a
material impact on our financial statements.  In June 2009, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles the
Codification which authorized the Codification as the sole source for authoritative U.S. GAAP. Any accounting literature that is not in the Codification will be considered nonauthoritative. We commenced utilizing the Codification as our
sole source of authoritative U.S. GAAP in this years third quarter.  2.
Discontinued Operations The following tables summarize the activity for the years ended January30, 2010 and January31, 2009 associated with our discontinued operations, which consist of the closing of both our ProFoods clubs in January 2007, three

Closure of ProFoods In fiscal 2005, we began testing a concept that was new to BJs by opening two new clubs in the Metro New York market exclusively for
food service businesses under the name ProFoods Restaurant Supply ProFoods. Both ProFoods clubs were closed in
the fourth quarter ended February3, 2007. The operating results of these clubs are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. We recorded a charge of $257 million to close these clubs in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Included in this charge were lease obligation costs of $88 million. In 2007, we settled the lease for one of the two closed ProFoods locations, and subleased the other ProFoods location for a portion of its remaining lease term, which reduced the
reserve by approximately $40 million. In 2008 and 2009, increases in the reserve consisted of interest accretion charges and reductions to the reserve consisted of lease obligation payments. 2002 Closure of Three BJs Locations On November9, 2002, we closed both of our clubs in the Columbus, Ohio, market and a club in North Dade, Florida. We have settled two of the three leases. The reserve for BJs closed clubs at
January30, 2010 was related to the lease obligations for the remaining club. In 2008, based on our evaluation of the status of the remaining closed club, we recorded a pretax charge of $05 million. All other increases in 2008 and 2009
consisted of interest accretion charges and reductions consisted of lease obligation payments. The charges for both ProFoods
and BJs lease obligations were based on the present value of rent liabilities under the relevant leases, including estimated real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges, reduced by estimated income from the potential subleasing of
these properties. An annual discount rate of 6% was used to calculate the present value of the obligations. The liabilities for the closed club leases are included in current and noncurrent closed store obligations on our balance sheet. 
2008 Closure of One BJs Location On October7, 2008, we sold our owned club in Greenville, South Carolina, for $85 million and subsequently ceased operations on October14, 2008. The operating results of the club are presented
in discontinued operations in the statement of income for all periods presented. For 2008 and 2007, the club had total revenues of $177 million and $236 million, respectively. The club had a pretax operating loss of $04 million in 2008 and pretax
operating income of $39,000 in 2007. We recorded a pretax loss of $04 million in 2008 to close the club which consisted mainly of a $03 million loss on inventory liquidation, $02 million for employee termination benefits, $02 million for
membership refunds, $02 million in other exit costs, offset by a $05 million gain on the sale of fixed assets. As of January30, 2010, we have recorded and paid all liabilities for this club and do not expect any future expense related to its
closing.  3.
Debt As of
January30, 2010, long-term debt, less the portion due within one year, consisted entirely of real estate debt, bearing interest at 7%, maturing through November1, 2011. Real estate debt was collateralized by land and buildings with a net
book value of $99 million. On October30, 2009, we entered into a new $200 million unsecured credit agreement with a
group of banks which expires October30, 2012. The new agreement replaced our previous $225 million unsecured credit agreement, which was scheduled to expire on April27, 2010. The agreement includes a $50 million sub-facility for letters
of credit. We are required to pay an annual commitment fee which is currently 0375% of the amount by which the total commitment exceeds the total outstanding balance. Interest on borrowings is payable at BJs option either at athe
LIBOR rate plus a margin which is currently 275% or ba floating rate equal to a margin which is currently 175%, plus the highest of ithe sum of the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 050%, iithe agent banks prime rate
or iiithe one-month LIBOR rate plus 10%. The commitment fee, the LIBOR margin and the floating rate margin are subject to change based upon our adjusted leverage ratio as defined in the agreement. 
39 Table of Contents
The agreement contains financial covenants which require a minimum fixed charge coverage
ratio and a maximum adjusted leverage ratio. We are required to comply with these covenants on a quarterly basis. Under the credit agreement, we may pay dividends or repurchase our own stock in any amount so long as we remain in compliance with all
requirements under the agreement. We have no credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity date if borrowings were outstanding under our credit agreement. We were in compliance with the covenants and other requirements set forth in our
credit agreement at January30, 2010. In addition to the credit agreement, we maintain a $15 million uncommitted credit
line for short-term borrowings. We plan to renew this line before its April30, 2010 expiration. We also maintain two separate facilities totaling $72 million for letters of credit, primarily to support the purchase of inventories, of which $16
million was outstanding at January30, 2010. There were no borrowings outstanding under our bank credit agreement or our
uncommitted credit line at January30, 2010 or January31, 2009.  4.
Leases We are obligated
under long-term leases for the rental of real estate. In addition, we are generally required to pay insurance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses and, in some cases, additional rentals based on a percentage of sales in excess of certain
amounts, or other factors. Many of our leases require escalating payments during the lease term. Rent expense for such leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The initial primary term of our real estate leases excluding
ground leases ranges from 4 to 25 years. Most of these leases have an initial term of 20 years. The initial primary term of our ground leases ranges from 15 to 44 years, and averages approximately 24 years. As of January30, 2010, we have
options to renew all but one of our leases for periods that range from 5 to 65 years, and average approximately 21 years. Future minimum lease payments as of January30, 2010 were:  Fiscal Years Ending

balance sheets. Rental expense under operating leases including contingent rentals, which were not material amounted to
$161,874,000, $148,788,000, and $142,213,000 in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.  5.
Contingencies We are
involved in various legal proceedings that are typical of a retail business. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these proceedings or any related claims, we believe that such proceedings or claims will not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Provision for Credit Card Claims Early in 2004, we were notified by credit card issuers that credit and debit card accounts used legitimately at BJs were
subsequently used in fraudulent transactions at non-BJs locations. On August5, 2008, the U.S. Attorneys Office in Boston charged 11 individuals with allegedly breaching the credit card security systems of a number of retailers,
including BJs, in 2004, and these individuals have pleaded guilty to various charges. In prior years, we recorded total
pretax charges of $130 million to establish a reserve for claimants seeking reimbursement for fraudulent credit and debit card charges and the cost of replacing cards, monitoring expenses and related fees and expenses. As of January30, 2010,
all filed legal claims arising from the alleged data breaches were resolved. We recorded pretax income of $29 million to reverse the majority of our remaining reserve for these claims. As of January30, 2010, the balance in the reserve was
$04 million, which represents our best estimate of the remaining costs and expenses related to this matter. Wage and Hour
Settlement In November 2008, BJs was sued in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts
the court in a purported class action brought on behalf of current and former department and other assistant managers, in which plaintiffs principally alleged that they had not been compensated for overtime work as required
under federal and Massachusetts law. Caissie v. BJs Wholesale Club., Case No3:08cv30220. In the third quarter
of 2009, we recorded a pretax charge in selling, general and administrative SGA expenses of $117 million in connection with a proposed settlement of this claim and related payments. Under the settlement, which still must be
finally approved by the court, certain current and former mid-level managers will be eligible to receive payments to compensate them for particular hours worked in prior years. The settlement of the lawsuit is not an admission by us of any
wrongdoing. We expect to pay the settlement in the next twelve months and have recorded the liability within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our balance sheet. The number of employees who will receive compensation and the amount of each settlement will not be known until the court proceeds with the
final approval of the settlement terms and all employee claims are submitted. We will work with the court and a settlement administrator as the parties establish the process through which the settlement amount will be allocated and the amount each
eligible employee will receive is determined. While the ultimate outcome of the claims paid could differ from what we have recorded, the difference is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or liquidity.
Subsequent to January30, 2010, we paid $92 million into a settlement fund and we are awaiting a final approval from
the court before all claims and related payments are made. As permitted by Delaware law, BJs has entered into
agreements whereby it indemnifies its directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving, at the Companys request, in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments that
BJs could be required to make under these agreements is not limited. However, BJs carries insurance for current and former directors and officers that covers its exposure up to certain limits. As a result of our insurance coverage, we
believe that the estimated fair value of our indemnification agreements with directors and officers is minimal. No liabilities have been recorded for these agreements as of January30, 2010 nor have any claims been made.

differ from the stock repurchase amounts reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows by $97 million in 2009, $106 million in 2008 and $32 million in 2007, due to transactions that had not settled at the end of each fiscal year. As of
January30, 2010, our remaining repurchase authorization from the Board of Directors was $761 million. In addition to
the above repurchases, upon the vesting of certain restricted stock awards, 47,384 shares in 2009 and 2,707 shares in 2008 were reacquired to satisfy employees tax withholding obligations. In 2009 these reacquired shares were recorded as an
additional $17 million of treasury stock and accordingly, reduced the number of common shares outstanding by 47,384. In 2008, the reacquired shares were recorded as an additional $01 million of treasury stock and accordingly, reduced the number of
common shares outstanding by 2,707. In December 1997, one of BJs subsidiaries issued 126 shares of non-voting preferred
stock to individual stockholders, at $2,200 per share. These shares are entitled to receive ongoing annual dividends of $200 per share. The minority interest in this subsidiary is equal to the preferred shares preference in an involuntary
liquidation of $277,200 and is included in other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at January30, 2010 and January31, 2009.  7.
Stock Incentive Plans On
May24, 2007, at the 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company, BJs stockholders approved the adoption of our 2007 Stock Incentive Plan the 2007 Plan. As of May24, 2007, the 2007 Plan replaced BJs 1997
Stock Incentive Plan the 1997 Plan and no further grants would be made under the 1997 Plan. On May 21, 2009 at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company, the 2007 Plan was amended to allow for additional adjustments to
performance goals when calculating award payments. Awards may be made under the 2007 Plan for up to 4,000,000 shares of
BJs common stock subject to adjustment for changes in capitalization, including stock splits and other similar events. The 2007 Plan provides that all full value awards, which generally means awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights will count against the 4,000,000 maximum shares issuable under the 2007 Plan at a ratio of
two-to-one. Stock options and stock appreciation rights will count against shares issuable at a ratio of one-to-one. If an
award expires, terminates, is cancelled or otherwise results in shares not being issued, the unused shares covered by such award will generally become available for future grant under the 2007 Plan. Under the 2007 Plan, stock options must be granted at an exercise price equal to or greater than the closing price of BJs common stock
on the date of grant. Options may not be granted for a term in excess of ten years. The 2007 Plan provides for the automatic
grant of options to members of the Board of Directors who are not BJs employees. On the commencement of service on the Board, each non-employee director will receive a non-qualified stock option to purchase 10,000 shares. In addition, on the
date of each Annual Meeting of Shareholders, each non-employee director who is serving as a director immediately before and after such meeting
42 Table of Contents
will receive a non-qualified option grant to purchase 5,000 shares. Director options vest on a cumulative basis in three equal annual installments beginning on the first day of the month which
includes the first anniversary of the grant. The Board may issue other stock-based awards in lieu of some or all of the options otherwise issuable. The 2007 Plan generally requires that all stock options have a minimum one-year vesting period. In general, restricted stock awards that vest solely on the passage of time may not vest sooner than ratably
over three years and such awards that do not vest solely on the passage of time may not vest prior to the first anniversary of the grant. These minimum vesting requirements can be waived in extraordinary circumstances, including death, disability or retirement, estate planning needs, or the occurrence of a business combination,
recapitalization or change of control. In addition, restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards and other stock-based awards for up to an aggregate of 100,000 shares of common stock may be granted without satisfying the minimum vesting
requirements. The 100,000 number already reflects application of the two-to-one fungible share ratio described above. As of
January30, 2010 and January31, 2009, respectively, 983,150 and 2,051,530 shares were reserved for all future stock awards under the 2007 Plan. Total share-based compensation recognized in the financial statements was $220 million $131 million post-tax in the fiscal year ended January30, 2010, $194 million $115 million post-tax in
the fiscal year ended January31, 2009 and $190 million $113 million post-tax in the fiscal year ended February2, 2008. As of January30, 2010, there was $267 million of total share-based compensation cost not yet recognized related to nonvested awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 17 years. The fair value of BJs stock options was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions no dividends were expected:  Fiscal Year Ended January302010 January312009 February22008 Risk-free interest rate 241 208 455 Expected volatility factor 410 388 365 Expected option life yrs. 55 55 55 Weighted-average grant-date fair value 1506 1335 1348
Expected volatility
for the years ended January30, 2010,January31, 2009, and February2, 2008 was based on a combination of implied volatility from traded options on our stock and historical volatility of our stock. 75% of our overall volatility
assumption was based on a review of BJs daily stock price volatility over the last five years. 25% was based on the implied volatility of near at-the-money exchange-traded options. We use historical data to estimate option exercise and
employee termination behavior within the valuation model. The expected option life represents an estimate of the period of time options are expected to remain outstanding based upon historical option exercise trends. The risk-free rate is for
periods within the expected life of the option and is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.

The total fair value of restricted shares vested was $53 million in the year ended
January30, 2010, $44 million in the year ended January31, 2009, and $27 million in the year ended February2, 2008. Restricted stock awards are issued at no cost to the recipients and have service restrictions that generally lapse over three to four years from the date of grant. Grant-date fair value of the award is charged to income ratably over the
period during which the restrictions lapse. Approximately 90,500 shares of the restricted stock issued in 2009, 79,000 of the restricted shares issued in 2008 and 143,000 of the restricted shares issued in 2007 also have performance condition
vesting features. When achievement of the performance condition is deemed probable, we recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the awards expected vesting periods. Performance shares are included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share, if their effect is dilutive, in the period in which the performance conditions have been attained.  8.

$02 million as a result of unfavorable state income tax audit settlements. Of this total, $01 million reflected an increase in income tax reserves and $01 million reflected an increase in interest reserves. During the year ended January31,
2009, we recorded a reduction in our income tax provision totaling $33 million as a result of favorable state income tax audit settlements. Of this total, $21 million reflected a reduction in income tax reserves and $12 million reflected a
reduction in interest reserves. During the year ended February2, 2008, we recorded a reduction in our income tax provision totaling $36 million, also as a result of favorable state income tax audit settlements.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:  January302010 January312009 Dollars in Thousands Beginning balance 6,271 20,654 Additions for tax positions taken during prior years 1,447 1,067 Reductions for tax positions taken during prior years 324 4,497 Additions for tax positions taken during the current year 554 576 Settlements 3,571 10,783 Lapses in statutes of limitations 810 746 Ending balance 3,567 6,271 The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, reflective of federal tax benefits that, if recognized, would
decrease the effective tax rate at January30, 2010 was $25 million and at January31, 2009 was $43 million. We
classify interest expense and any penalties related to income tax uncertainties as a component of income tax expense, which is consistent with the recognition of these items in prior reporting periods. For the years ended January30, 2010 and
January31, 2009, we recognized $04 million $02 million, net of federal and state tax benefit and $20 million $11 million, net of federal and state tax benefit, respectively, in interest expense. As of January31, 2009, we had $29
million of accrued interest $17 million, net of federal and state tax benefit related to income tax uncertainties. Accrued interest decreased by $19 million $11 million, net of federal and state benefit for the year ended January30,
2010 to $10 million $06 million, net of federal and state benefit. This decrease was primarily attributable to state income tax audit settlements.

Retirement Plans Under
BJs 401k savings plans, participating employees may make pretax contributions up to 50% of covered compensation subject to federal limits. BJs matches employee contributions at 100% of the first one percent of covered compensation and
50% of the next four percent. The Companys expense under these plans was $8,051,000, $6,941,000, and $5,813,000 in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. We have a non-contributory defined contribution retirement plan for certain key employees. Under this plan, BJs funds annual retirement contributions for the designated participants on an after-tax
basis. For the last three years, the Companys contributions equaled 5% of the participants base salary. Participants become fully vested in their contribution accounts at the end of the fiscal year in which they complete four full fiscal
years of service. Our pretax expense under this plan was $1,756,000, $1,633,000, and $1,416,000, in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  11.
Postretirement Medical Benefits We have a defined benefit postretirement medical plan which covers employees who retire after age 55 with at least 10 years of service, who are not eligible for Medicare, and who participated in a Company-sponsored medical plan. Spouses and
eligible dependents are also covered under the plan. Amounts contributed by retired employees under this plan are based on years of service prior to retirement. The plan is not funded. The discount rates presented in the tables below were selected
by referencing yields on high quality corporate bonds, using the Citigroup Pension Yield Curve. We recognize the funded
status of the postretirement medical plan on our balance sheet. The funded status represents the difference between the projected benefit liability obligation of the plan and the market value of the plans assets. Previously unrecognized
deferred amounts such as actuarial gains and losses and the impact of historical plan changes are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Changes in these amounts in future years are adjusted as they occur through accumulated
other comprehensive income loss. Obligation and Funded Status The change in obligation and funded status of the plan at January30, 2010 and January31, 2009 were as follows:  Fiscal Year Ended January302010 January312009 Dollars in Thousands Change in Obligation Projected benefit obligation at beginning of year 7,490 6,916 Company service cost 688 702 Interest cost 483 405 Plan participants contributions 91 73 Net actuarial loss gain 849 431 Benefit payments made directly by the Company 145 103 Other adjustments 63 72 Projected benefit obligation at end of year 9,393 7,490 Change in Plan Assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year Company contributions 54 30 Plan participants contributions 91 73 Benefit payments made directly by the Company 145 103 Fair value of plan assets at end of year Funded status at end of year 9,393 7,490

The funded status of the plan as of January30, 2010 and January31, 2009 has been
recognized as a net liability in other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet. We expect to contribute approximately $59,000 to the postretirement plan next year.

VISA/MasterCard Settlement In April 2003, a settlement was reached in the VISA/MasterCard antitrust class action litigation. The terms of the settlement require VISA and MasterCard to pay $305 billion into a settlement fund that will be distributed to class members.
We are a member of the class and are entitled to a portion of the fund. In 2005, we received a settlement offer related to the distribution of the fund. Based upon information contained in the settlement offer, we recorded a $31 million pretax
estimated recovery as a reduction to SGA expenses in 2005. On a post-tax basis, this recovery was $19 million. In 2006, we received cash recoveries totaling $33 million. As a result we recorded a pretax gain of $02 million as a reduction of
SGA in 2006. There were no cash recoveries in 2007. In 2008 and 2009, we received additional pretax recoveries of $09 million and $30 million, respectively, which were also recorded as a reduction of SGA. We do not expect to receive
further material recoveries from this settlement.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BJs Wholesale Club, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item8 present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of BJs Wholesale Club, Inc. and its subsidiaries at January30, 2010 and January31, 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
January30, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
January30, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these
financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for uncertain tax positions in the period ended February2, 2008. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. BJs management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January30, 2010. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of January30, 2010, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was
effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
January30, 2010 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. March25, 2010  Item1B.
Unresolved Staff Comments None.  Item2.
Controls and Procedures The Companys management, with the participation of the Companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of January30,
2010. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including
its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of the Companys disclosure controls and
procedures as of January30, 2010, the Companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Managements report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and
15d-15f under the Exchange Act and the independent registered public accounting firms audit report are included in Item8 of this Form 10-K and are incorporated herein by reference. No change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended January30, 2010 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.  Item9B.
