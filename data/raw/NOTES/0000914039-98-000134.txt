REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of TransAct Technologies Incorporated
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of income, of cash flows and of changes in shareholders'
equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
TransAct Technologies Incorporated and its subsidiaries, as described in Note 1,
at December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1997 and December 31, 1996 and the
nine months ended December 31, 1995, and their changes in shareholders' equity
for the year ended December 31, 1997 and the period from August 22, 1996 through
December 31, 1996 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

intercompany indebtedness to Tridex; vi Tridex applied to the Internal
Revenue Service the IRS for a ruling that the distribution of the
5,400,000 shares of TransAct owned by Tridex to Tridex stockholders the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2.  BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: The Company considers all highly liquid
investments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to
be cash equivalents.
USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
FOREIGN CURRENCY: The financial position and results of operations of
the Company foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the
functional currency. Assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries have been
translated at end of period exchange rates, and related revenues and
expenses have been translated at weighted average exchange rates. The
aggregate effect of translation adjustments so calculated for periods prior
to the Offering, which would be ordinarily included as a separate component
of shareholders' equity, is de minimis. Transaction gains and losses are
included in other income.
INVENTORIES: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally
standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out
basis or market.
PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION: Plant and equipment and leasehold
improvements are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided for primarily by
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. The estimated
useful life of machinery, furniture and equipment is three to ten years.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the
lease or the useful life of the asset. Depreciation amounted to $1,227,000,
$905,000 and $521,000 in the year ended December 31, 1997, December 31,
1996 and the nine months ended December 31, 1995, respectively.
EXCESS OF COST OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED: The excess of
cost over fair value of net assets acquired goodwill resulted from the
acquisition of Ithaca in 1991. The original amount applicable to this
acquisition totaled $3,536,000 and is being amortized on the straight line
method over 20 years. Accumulated amortization of goodwill was $1,463,000
and $1,290,000 at December 31, 1997 and December 31, 1996, respectively.
The Company periodically reviews goodwill to assess recoverability based
upon expectations of non-discounted cash flows from operations for Ithaca.
The Company believes that no impairment of goodwill exists at December 31,
1997.
REVENUE RECOGNITION: Sales are recognized when the product is shipped.
Revenue from extended warranty and maintenance agreements is recognized
over the term of such agreements as services are performed. Sales to one
customer accounted for approximately 29%, 16% and 12% of net sales for the
year ended December 31, 1997, December 31, 1996 and the nine months ended
December 31, 1995, respectively.
INCOME TAXES: Through the date of the Distribution, the Company was
included in the consolidated federal and certain state income tax returns
of Tridex. The income tax amounts reflected in the accompanying financial
statements are accounted for under the liability method in accordance with
FAS 109 Accounting for Income Taxes, and for the periods presented
through the date of the Distribution are an allocation of Tridex
consolidated balances, and are computed as if a separate return had been
filed for the Company, using those elements of income and expense as
reported in the consolidated statements of income. Subsequent to the
Distribution, the Company will file federal and state income tax returns
separately from Tridex. See Note 13.
EARNINGS PER SHARE: TransAct adopted FAS 128 Earnings per Share,
effective December 15, 1997, which requires the dual presentation of basic
and diluted earnings per share for complex capital structures. In
accordance with FAS 128, earnings per share presented in the accompanying
financial statements for periods prior to adoption have been restated. For
the year ended December 31, 1996, December 31, 1995 unaudited, the nine
months ended December 31, 1995 and the nine months ended December 31, 1994
unaudited, pro forma basic and diluted earnings per share are based on
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, as if
all shares issued to Tridex prior to the Offering had been outstanding
throughout these periods.                    21

2.  BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: The Company has elected to follow Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
APB 25, and related interpretations in accounting for its stock
options. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of employee stock options
equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no
compensation expense is recorded. The Company has adopted the
disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation FAS 123. See Note
11.
3. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Prior to the Offering, the Company participated in Tridex centralized
cash management system. While under this system, cash deposits from the
Company were transferred to Tridex and Tridex funded the Company
disbursement bank accounts as required. In August 1996, the Company ceased
to participate in the Tridex cash management system.
Prior to the Offering, Tridex provided certain general and
administrative services to the Company, including tax, treasury, risk
management and insurance, legal, marketing, accounting, auditing, human
resources and executive management. For periods prior to the Offering,
these expenses were allocated to the Company based upon actual usage for
those expenses directly attributable to the Company, and otherwise
allocated based upon other methods which management believes to be
reasonable. These allocations were $869,000 and $1,203,000 for the year
ended December 31, 1996 and the nine months ended December 31, 1995,
respectively. These costs may have been different had the Company operated
as a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented.
Included as a component of Tridex investment in the Company are net
cash advances from Tridex to the Company and general and administrative
expenses allocated from Tridex to the Company. No interest expense on net
advances from Tridex has been reflected in the accompanying financial
statements.
On July 31, 1996, the Company entered into a Corporate Services
Agreement with Tridex. Under the terms of this agreement, Tridex agreed to
provide the Company with certain services, including employee benefit
administration, human resource and related services, administrative
services, risk management, regulatory compliance, preparation of tax
returns and certain financial and other services. Such services were
provided and reimbursed at actual cost, which amounted to approximately
$96,000 and $91,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997 and December 31,
1996, respectively. Certain services ceased to be provided after March 31,
1997. Also, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Tridex agreed to pay
15% of the direct employment costs of the Company chief financial officer
through March 31, 1997, which amounted to approximately $7,000 and $8,000
for the year ended December 31, 1997 and December 31, 1996, respectively.
The Corporate Services Agreement expired on December 31, 1997.
On July 31, 1996, the Company entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement with
Tridex. The agreement provides for the treatment of certain tax attributes
of the Company including the method of allocating tax obligations,
treatment of tax carryforwards and the computation of income tax provisions
for the Company between the date of the Offering and the Distribution. In
addition, tax benefits related to certain tax carryforwards arising prior
to the Distribution will be paid to Tridex as the carryforwards are
utilized. For the year ended December 31, 1997 and December 31, 1996, the
Company paid, net of refunds from Tridex, approximately $410,000 and
$527,000, respectively, to Tridex pursuant to the agreement.
The Company and Tridex also entered into an Asset Transfer Agreement
dated July 31, 1996, under which the Company agreed to transfer to Tridex
certain assets used in the manufacturing process of the printer ribbon
product line. Additionally, on September 28, 1996, the Company and Tridex
entered into a Manufacturing Support Services Agreement. Under this
agreement, the Company agrees to provide Tridex with space within its
Wallingford, CT manufacturing facility and certain support services for the
ribbon business through September 28, 1998. Tridex agrees to pay the
Company a monthly fee calculated to compensate the Company for the direct
and indirect costs incurred by the Company to provide the space and render
such services. These fees amounted to approximately $254,000 and $67,000
during the year ended December 31, 1997 and December 31, 1996,
respectively. The Company also purchased approximately $4,000 and $5,000 of
ribbons from Tridex during the same periods.                    22

The Company sells certain POS printers to a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Tridex. Revenues from the sale of such printers amounted to $2,675,000,
$3,178,000 and $2,340,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997, the year
ended December 31, 1996 and the nine months ended December 31, 1995,
respectively. On July 30, 1996, the Company entered into a Printer Supply
Agreement which will require the subsidiary, in consideration for continued
favorable price terms, to purchase from the Company at least three quarters
of its total POS printer requirements through December 31, 1999.
On April 1, 1997, the Company established the TransAct Technologies
Retirement Savings Plan the Plan, a defined contribution plan under
Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. Prior to the Distribution, the
Company employees participated in the Tridex Corporation Retirement
Savings Plan. All full-time employees are eligible to participate in the
Plan at the beginning of the calendar quarter immediately following their
date of hire. The Company matches employees' contributions at a rate of
375% of employees' contributions up to the first 4% of the employees'
compensation contributed to the Plan. The Company matching contributions
were $101,000, $80,000 and $51,000 in the year ended December 31, 1997,
December 31, 1996 and the nine months ended December 31, 1995,
respectively, and are included in general and administrative expense.
Effective January 1, 1998, the Company increased its rate of matching
contributions to 50% of the employees' contributions up to the first 4% of
the employees' compensation contributed to the Plan.

9.  BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT
On August 29, 1996, the Company entered into an agreement with Fleet
National Bank Fleet to provide the Company with a $5,000,000 revolving
credit facility the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility bears interest
on outstanding borrowings at Fleet prime rate 825% at December 31,
1997 and bears a commitment fee of 025% on any unused portion of the
Credit Facility. The Credit Facility also permits the Company to designate
a LIBOR rate on outstanding borrowings with a margin of 15 percentage
points over the market rate. The Credit Facility is secured by a lien on
substantially all of the assets of the Company, imposes certain financial
covenants and restricts the payment of cash dividends. The Company had
borrowings of $1,500,000 under the Credit Facility during the year ended
December 31, 1997 and none during the year ended December 31, 1996. The
Company had $300,000 of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 1997.
On January 29, 1998, the Company replaced its existing $5,000,000
Credit Facility with a new $15,000,000 facility the New Credit
Facility. The New Credit Facility, also with Fleet, provides the Company
with a $5,000,000 revolving working capital facility, and a $10,000,000
revolving credit facility that may be used for activities such as
acquisitions and repurchases of the Company common stock. Borrowings
under the $10,000,000 revolving credit facility may, at the Company
election, be converted to a four-year term loan commencing on June 30,
1999, the expiration date of the New Credit Facility. Any term loan
borrowings mature on June 30, 2003. Borrowings under the New Credit
Facility bear interest at Fleet prime rate and bear a commitment fee
ranging from 025% to 050% on any unused portion of the New Credit
Facility. The New Credit Facility also permits the Company to designate a
LIBOR rate on outstanding borrowings with a margin ranging from 125 to
175 percentage points over the market rate, depending on the Company
meeting certain ratios. The New Credit Facility is secured by a lien on
substantially all of the assets of the Company, imposes certain financial
covenants and restricts the payment of cash dividends and the creation of
liens.
10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
At December 31, 1997, the Company was lessee on operating leases for
equipment and real property. The terms of certain leases provide for
escalating rent payments in later years of the lease as well as payment of
minimum rent and real estate taxes. Rent expense amounted to approximately
$713,000, $682,000 and $532,000 in the year ended December 31, 1997,
December 31, 1996 and the nine months ended December 31, 1995,
respectively. Minimum aggregate rental payments required under operating
leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess
of one year as of December 31, 1997 are as follows: $836,000 in 1998;
$864,000 in 1999; $842,000 in 2000; $826,000 in 2001; $806,000 in 2002 and
$4,516,000 thereafter.
The Company has a long-term purchase agreement for certain printer
components. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company receives
favorable pricing for volume purchases over the life of the contract. In
the event anticipated purchase levels are not achieved, the Company would
be subject to retroactive price increases on previous purchases. Management
currently anticipates achieving sufficient purchase levels to maintain the
favorable prices.
In conjunction with the Plan of Reorganization, as described in Note 1,
Tridex indemnified the Company from any liabilities, including
environmental liabilities, which could arise in connection with a
manufacturing facility owned by Tridex and formerly operated by the
Company.                    25

granted 78,800 shares of restricted common stock to its Chairman of the
Board, officers and certain key employees. Restricted stock totaling 49,800
shares vest over a five-year period, while 29,000 shares vest at the end of
a five-year period. Under certain conditions vesting may be automatically
accelerated. Upon issuance of the restricted stock, unearned compensation
equivalent to the market value at the date of grant is charged to
stockholders' equity and subsequently amortized over the vesting period.
Amortization expense of $124,000 was recorded during 1997.
WARRANTS: On August 22, 1996, the Company sold to the underwriters of
the Offering, for nominal consideration, a warrant to purchase from the
Company up to 115,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1020
per share. The warrant is exercisable for a period of five years beginning
April 1, 1998. No warrants were exercisable at December 31, 1997.

plan declaring a distribution of one right the Rights for each
outstanding share of the Company common stock to shareholders of record
at December 15, 1997. Initially, each of the Rights will entitle the
registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a
share of Series A Preferred Stock, $001 par value, at a price of $69 per
one one-thousandth of a share. The Rights, however, will not become
exercisable unless and until, among other things, any person or group of
affiliated persons acquires beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of
the then outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock. If a person, or
group of persons, acquires 15 percent or more of the outstanding Common
Stock of the Company subject to certain conditions and exceptions more
fully described in the Rights Agreement, each Right will entitle the
holder other than the person, or group of persons, who acquired 15 percent
or more of the outstanding Common Stock to purchase Preferred Stock of the
Company having a market value equal to twice the exercise price of the
Right. The Rights are redeemable, under certain circumstances, for $00001
per Right and will expire, unless earlier redeemed, on December 2, 2007.                    27

trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and bank loans approximate fair
value because of the short maturity of those instruments.
