Consolidated Financial Statements as of June30, 2007 and
2006, and for each of the years in the three year period ended

73 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL
CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of   CheckFree Corporation and Subsidiaries   Norcross, Georgia   We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that CheckFree Corporation and Subsidiaries
the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of June30, 2007, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in
Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting,
management excluded from its assessment the internal control
over financial reporting at Carreker Corporation, which was
acquired on April2, 2007, Corillian Corporation, which was
acquired on May15, 2007, and Upstream Technologies LLC,
which substantially all the assets were acquired on May31,
2007 and whose combined financial statements constitute 228
percent of total assets and 24 percent of revenues, of the
consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year
ended June30, 2007. Accordingly, our audit did not include
the internal control over financial reporting at Carreker
Corporation, Corillian Corporation and Upstream Technologies
LLC. The Companys management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
companys principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
by the companys board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.   In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of June30, 2007, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the   
74 Table of Contents   Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of June30, 2007, based on the
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.   We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheet of CheckFree Corporation and
Subsidiaries as of June30, 2007, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders
equity, and cash flows for the year ended June30, 2007,
and the consolidated financial statement schedule listed in the
index at , and our report dated August24, 2007
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements
and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory
paragraph regarding the adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No123R, Share Based
Payment.     Atlanta, Georgia   August24, 2007   
75 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of   CheckFree Corporation and Subsidiaries   Norcross, Georgia   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
CheckFree Corporation and Subsidiaries as of June30, 2007
and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended June30, 2007. Our audit also
included the financial statement schedule, listed in the Index
at . These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of CheckFree
Corporation and Subsidiaries at June30, 2007 and 2006, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended June30, 2007 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.   As described in Note1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No123R, Share Based
Payment, effective July1, 2005, based on the
modified prospective application transition method.   We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of June30, 2007, based on the
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
August24, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting and an
unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting.     Atlanta, Georgia   August24, 2007

principal operating company of our business. CheckFree Services
was founded in 1981 and is a leading provider of financial
electronic commerce products and services. See Note19 for
a description of our business segments.   Principles
of Consolidation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
results of our operations and the results of our wholly owned
subsidiaries. We have eliminated all significant intercompany
accounts and transactions in consolidation.   Use of
Estimates   The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
the United States of America GAAP. The preparation
of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us
to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during our
reporting period. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates.
Estimates are based on historical experience and various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under applicable
circumstances. Our actual results could differ from those
estimates.   Cash and
Cash Equivalents   We consider all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with
original maturities of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.   Investments   We have certain investments in marketable debt securities that
are classified as available-for-sale in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities SFAS115. Our
available-for-sale investments are recorded at fair value and
changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized gains and
losses, net of applicable taxes, in accumulated other
comprehensive income loss, a component of stockholders
equity on our consolidated balance sheet. We regularly evaluate
whether declines in fair value of our available-for-sale
investments result in other-than-temporary impairments. In
performing this evaluation, we assess the severity and duration
of an impairment, the recovery of fair value, and our ability
and intent to hold the security. If it is determined that a
security suffers an other than temporary impairment, the fair
value is recorded as the new cost basis.   We have certain other investments in venture capital investment
portfolio funds as well as equity and debt securities that are
accounted for under the cost method. Under the cost method of
accounting, investments are carried at cost and are adjusted
only for other-than-temporary declines in fair value,
distributions of earnings and additional investments. We
periodically evaluate whether declines in fair value of our
other investments are other-than-temporary. In performing this
evaluation, we consider various factors including any decline in
market price, and where available, the investees financial
condition, results of operations, operating trends and other
financial ratios.   
82 Table of Contents   We have received equity instruments in connection with
agreements with certain partners. In such cases, our initial
cost was determined based on the estimated fair value of the
equity instruments received. Subsequent changes in the fair
value of these equity instruments are accounted for in
accordance with the investment policies described above.   In April 2004, we entered into a joint venture, OneVu Limited
OneVu, with Voca Limited Voca, in
the United Kingdom to create an integrated electronic billing
and payment network for billers and banks in the United Kingdom.
We currently have a 466% equity interest in OneVu, therefore,
we account for our interest in OneVu under the equity method of
accounting. We provided 100% of OneVus necessary working
capital requirements during its formative stage, and therefore,
the equity in net loss of OneVu represents 100% of the loss
incurred by OneVu through March31, 2006. In March 2006, we
entered into an additional funding arrangement with Voca related
to OneVu whereby both joint venture partners contributed
approximately $08million in exchange for a security
interest subordinate to our previous funding. OneVu obtained a
line of credit facility from a bank in the amount of
approximately $27million. Accordingly, beginning in April
2006, we continued to record the operations of OneVu on the
equity basis of accounting recognizing only 466% of the results
of operations of OneVu. We have invested $72million in
the joint venture. We did not invest any amount into the joint
venture during the year ended June30, 2007.   Settlement
Assets and Obligations   Amounts receivable from our agents and customers, as well as
amounts payable to our agents and customers associated with our
walk-in payment services, are classified as settlement assets
and obligations. The majority of these assets and obligations
result from timing differences between our agents collecting
funds from the consumers making the payments and depositing the
funds collected into our bank accounts. Settlement assets and
obligations arise due to our reporting of transactions to our
customers prior to fulfilling the payment obligation.   Concentrations
of Credit Risk   Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, investments and
trade accounts receivable. Excess cash is invested through
banks, mutual funds and brokerage houses primarily in highly
liquid securities. We have investment policies and procedures
that limit any concentration of credit risk with single issuers.
With respect to accounts receivable, we do not generally require
collateral and believe that any credit risk is substantially
mitigated by the nature of our customers and reasonably short
collection terms. We maintain reserves for potential credit
losses on customer accounts when deemed necessary.   Derivative
Financial Instruments   On July1, 2000, we adopted SFAS133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as
amended SFAS133, which requires that all
derivative financial instruments be recognized as either assets
or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives
that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through our
consolidated statement of operations. If the derivative
qualifies as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge,
changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset
against the change in fair value of assets, liabilities, or firm
commitments through earnings or recognized in accumulated other
comprehensive income loss, a component of stockholders
equity of our consolidated balance sheet, until the hedged item
is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a
derivatives change in fair value is immediately recognized
in earnings. We do not enter into derivative financial
instruments for speculative or trading purposes.   Property
and Equipment   Property and equipment are stated at cost. Property and
equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives as follows: land improvements,
building and building improvements, 15 to 30years;
computer equipment, software and furniture, 18months to
seven years. Equipment under capital leases is amortized using
the straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated
useful lives or the terms of   
83 Table of Contents   the leases. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser
of the estimated useful lives or remaining lease periods.   Capitalized
Software   Capitalized software includes purchased technology associated
with acquisitions and capitalized internal development costs.
Purchased technology is initially recorded based on the fair
value allocated at the time of acquisition. Internal development
costs are capitalized in accordance with the provisions of
either SFAS86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed
SFAS86 or Statement of Position
SOP
98-1,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use
SOP98-1.
Unamortized capitalized software costs in excess of estimated
future net realizable values from a particular product are
written down to estimated net realizable value. We determine
whether software costs fall under the provisions of SFAS86
or
SOP98-1
and account for them as follows   
SFAS86 Software development costs
incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility
are expensed as incurred. Software development costs incurred
after the technological feasibility of the subject software
product has been established are capitalized in accordance with
SFAS86. Capitalization continues until the related
products are available for distribution to customers.
Capitalized software costs are amortized on a
product-by-product
basis using either the estimated economic life of the product on
a straight-line basis over three to five years, or the current
year gross product revenue to the current and anticipated future
gross product revenue, whichever produces the greater annual
amortization.     
SOP98-1
Software costs incurred in the preliminary project stage are
expensed as incurred. Software costs incurred after the
preliminary project stage is complete, we have committed to the
project, and it is probable the software will be used to perform
the function intended are capitalized in accordance with
SOP98-1.
Capitalized software costs are amortized on a
product-by-product
basis using the estimated economic life of the product on a
straight-line basis, generally three to five years. Capitalized
software costs not expected to be completed and placed in
service are written down to estimated fair value.   Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets   Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the
fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Other
intangibles represent identifiable intangible assets purchased
in connection with business combinations. The costs of
identified intangible assets are generally amortized on a
straight-line basis over periods from eight months to ten years.   We perform our annual goodwill impairment review at least
annually on April 30 of each year. No indicators for impairment
were evident during our review for fiscal years 2007 or 2006.   Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets   In accordance with SFAS144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
SFAS144, we review long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events indicate that their carrying amount
may not be recoverable. In such reviews, estimated undiscounted
future cash flows associated with these assets or operations are
compared with their carrying value to determine if a write-down
to fair value is required normally measured by the expected
present value technique. There were no indicators of impairment
during our review for fiscal years 2007 or 2006.   Transaction
Processing   In connection with the timing of our financial transaction
processing, we are exposed to credit risk in the event of
nonperformance by other parties, such as returns. We utilize
credit analysis and other controls to manage our credit risk
exposure. We also maintain a reserve for future returns. This
reserve is included in accounts receivable on our consolidated
balance sheet.   
84 Table of Contents   Comprehensive
Income Loss   We report comprehensive income loss in accordance with
SFAS130, Reporting Comprehensive Income
SFAS130. This Statement requires disclosure
of total non-shareowner changes in equity and its components.
Total non-shareowner changes in equity include all changes in
equity during a period except those resulting from investments
by and distributions to shareowners. The components of
accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a component of
stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet,
applicable to us are unrealized gains or losses of
available-for-sale securities and derivative instruments, as
well as unrealized foreign currency translation differences. As
of June30, 2007, unrealized foreign currency translation
gains of $43million, gross unrealized gains of
$14million offset by gross unrealized loss of
$24million from our available-for-sale securities, net of
deferred taxes of $04million have been recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a component of
stockholders equity of our consolidated balance sheet.   Stock-Based
Compensation   On July1, 2005, we adopted, SFAS123R, Share
Based Payment SFAS123R using the
modified prospective method. SFAS123R requires all
share-based payments to employees to be recognized in the
financial statements based on their fair values and did not
change the accounting guidance for share-based payment
transactions with parties other than employees provided in
SFAS123, Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation SFAS123, as originally
issued and Emerging Issues Task Force EITF
96-18,
Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other
Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling,
Goods or Services
EITF96-18.   Upon our adoption of SFAS123R, we began recording
compensation cost related to equity-based awards that were
unvested as of July1, 2005, as well as for all new
equity-based awards after our adoption date. The compensation
cost to be recorded is based on the fair value at the grant
date. The adoption of SFAS123R did not have an effect on
our recognition of compensation expense relating to the vesting
of restricted stock grants. SFAS123Rrequired the
elimination of unearned compensation contra-equity account
related to earlier awards against the appropriate equity
accounts of our consolidated balance sheet.   Prior to the adoption of SFAS123R, cash flows resulting
from the tax benefit related to equity-based compensation was
presented in our operating cash flows, along with other tax cash
flows, in accordance with the provisions of
EITF00-15,
Classification in the Statement of Cash Flows of the
Income Tax Benefit Received by a Company upon Exercise of a
Nonqualified Employee Stock Option
EITF00-15.
SFAS123R superseded
EITF00-15,
amended SFAS95, Statement of Cash Flows and
requires tax benefits relating to excess equity-based
compensation deductions to be prospectively presented in our
statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows.   Had compensation cost for our stock-based compensation plans
been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for
awards under those plans in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS123R, our net income loss and net income loss

Under the provisions of
EITF96-18,
because none of the agreements have a disincentive for
non-performance, we record a charge for the fair value of the
portion of the warrants earned from the point in time when
vesting of the warrants becomes probable. Final determination of
fair value of the warrants occurs upon actual vesting.
EITF01-9,
requires that the fair value of certain types of warrants issued
to customers be recorded as a reduction of revenue to the extent
of cumulative revenue recorded from that customer.   Basic and
Diluted Earnings Per Share   We report basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS128, Earnings Per
Share SFAS128. Basic earnings per
common share is determined by dividing net income available to
common shareholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding. Diluted per common share amounts assume the
issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive equivalent
shares outstanding.   Foreign
Currency Translation   The financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are
measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
Operations using a local currency other than the
U.S.dollar are located in the United Kingdom, Canada,
European Union, and Australia. Foreign currency denominated
assets and liabilities for these operations are translated into
U.S.dollars based on exchange rates prevailing at the end
of the period, and revenues and expenses are translated at
average exchange rates during the period. The effects of foreign
exchange gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of
assets and liabilities of those entities from the functional
currency to the U.S.dollar are included in accumulated
other comprehensive income loss, a component of
stockholders equity of our consolidated balance sheet.
Recognized gains and losses from currency exchange transactions
are recorded in operating expenses in our consolidated
statements of operations and were not material to our
consolidated results of operations for fiscal years 2007, 2006
and 2005.   Revenue
Recognition   Our sources of revenue and methodology of recognition is as
follows   
Processing and Servicing Processing and
servicing includes revenues from transaction processing,
electronic funds transfer and monthly service fees on consumer
funds transfer services. We recognize revenues when the services
have been performed. Certain customer agreements include minimum
monthly revenue commitments to us and, of those agreements, some
have provisions that allow these minimum commitments to be
credited against future services, as defined. We defer any
portion of the minimum revenue commitments that we expect to be
credited against future services until the future services are
performed or the credits expire unused. Our estimate of minimums
to be credited against future services is primarily based on
customer specific historical experience and volume and growth
experience with other customers. Transaction fees related to our
walk-in payment operations are recorded gross of agent
commissions if we are required to invoice our customers for such
fees and remit the commission to our agents. As part of
processing certain types of transactions, we earn interest from
the time money is collected from our customers until the time
payment is made to the applicable merchants. These revenues,
which are generated from trust account balances not included on
our consolidated balance sheets, are included in our processing
and servicing revenues and totaled $400million,
$416million and $266million for the years ended
June30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.     
License Fees We recognize revenues on
software transactions in accordance with
SOP97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition
SOP97-2,
as amended by
SOP98-9,
Modification of
SOP97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
Transactions and
SOP81-1,
Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
Certain Production-Type Contracts, based on the terms and
conditions in the   
86 Table of Contents   
contract. In accordance with the provisions of
SOP97-2,
revenues from software license agreements are recognized when
there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, the fee
is fixed or determinable, collectibility is probable and the
software has been delivered, provided that no significant
obligation remains under the contract. We have multiple-element
software arrangements which in addition to software licensing
typically also include professional services and maintenance
services. For these arrangements, we recognize revenue using the
residual method. Under the residual method, the fair value of
the undelivered elements, based on vendor specific objective
evidence of fair value, is deferred. The difference between the
total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the
undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the
delivered elements. We determine the fair value of the
undelivered elements based on the amounts charged when those
elements are sold separately. Contracts accounted for under the
percentage-of-completion method are generally measured based on
the ratio of labor costs incurred to total estimated labor costs
to be incurred. Changes in estimates to complete and revisions
in overall profit estimates on these contracts are charged to
earnings in the period in which they are determined. We accrue
for contract losses if and when the current estimate of total
contract costs exceeds total contract revenue. Where a customer
enters into arrangements to purchase software and services on a
subscription basis, we recognize revenue in accordance with
Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No104, Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements. Under these arrangements,
we defer recognition of the implementation and license revenue
and recognize them ratably over the greater of the initial life
of the customer contract or the estimated life of the customer
service relationship. Costs associated with implementation are
deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the
arrangements.   
Maintenance Fees We recognize maintenance fee
revenues ratably over the term of the related contractual
support period, generally 12months.     
Professional Fees Other revenues consist
primarily of consulting and training services. We recognize
consulting revenues as services are performed and training
revenues are recognized upon delivery of the related services.   Our customers are billed in accordance with contract terms. We
do not record deferred revenue until all contractual obligations
are met. Maintenance is generally billed in advance on an annual
basis. We record any unrecognizable portion of billed fees as
deferred revenue until such time as revenue recognition is
appropriate. Credit losses, if any, are contemplated in the
establishment of the allowance for doubtful accounts.   Advertising
Costs   We expense advertising costs as incurred in accordance with
SOP93-7,
Reporting on Advertising Costs
SOP93-7.
Advertising expense for the years ended June30, 2007, 2006
and 2005 was $58million, $60million and
$61million, respectively. Advertising expenses are
included in sales and marketing costs in our consolidated
statements of operations.   Income
Taxes   We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS109,
Accounting for Income Taxes
SFAS109, which requires an asset and
liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for
income taxes. In accordance with SFAS109, deferred income
tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in
the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the
periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable
income. Income tax expense benefit is the tax payable or
refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the
period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.   Business
Segments   We report information about our business segments in accordance
with SFAS131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information
SFAS131. The Statement defines how operating
segments are determined and requires disclosure of certain
financial and descriptive information about a companys
operating segments. See Note19 for our segment information.   
87 Table of Contents   Related
Parties   We consider certain entities to be related parties as defined by
SFAS57, Related Party Disclosures
SFAS57, based on the ability to designate
for election a director to our board of directors as well as the
level of share ownership. First Data Corporation
FDC was considered a related party until the
beginning of our quarter ended September30, 2004 On
August29, 2006, we entered into an agreement with
Microsoft terminating its stockholder agreement, dated
September1, 2000, that gave Microsoft Corporation the
right to designate for election a director to our board. As a
result of the termination, Microsoft is no longer considered a
related party for financial statement purposes.   Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued Statement of Accounting Standards 159,
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
No115 SFAS159, which permits an
entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and
certain other items at fair value. Most of the provisions of
SFAS159 are elective; however, the amendment to FASB
Standard No115 applies to all entities with
available-for-sale and trading securities. The FASBs
stated objective in issuing this standard is to improve
financial reporting by entities with the opportunity to mitigate
volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related
assets and liabilities differently, without having to apply
complex hedging accounting provisions. The provisions of
SFAS159 are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal
year 2009, and we are currently evaluating the impact of the
adoption of SFAS159 on our consolidated financial
statements.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS157, Fair
Value Measurements SFAS157, which is
intended to provide guidance for using fair value to measure
assets and liabilities. In general, this pronouncement is
intended to establish a framework for determining fair value and
to expand the disclosures regarding the determination of fair
value. With certain financial instruments, a cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle may be required with the
impact of the change recorded as an adjustment to beginning
retained earnings. The provisions of SFAS157 are effective
as of the beginning of our fiscal year 2008, and we are
currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS157
on our consolidated financial statements.   In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
FIN48, an interpretation of SFAS109,
which is intended to increase comparability in the financial
reporting of income taxes. FIN48 provides additional
guidance regarding the recognition and measurement of uncertain
tax positions in a companys consolidated financial
statements by establishing a more-likely-than-not
recognition threshold. Once the threshold has been met,
companies are required to recognize the largest amount of the
benefit that is greater than 50percent likely on an
accumulated basis of being realized upon ultimate settlement
with the taxing authority. The provisions of FIN48 are
effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year 2008, and we
are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of
FIN48 on our consolidated financial statements.   In September 2006, the SEC released Staff Accounting
BulletinNo108, codified as SABTopic 1.N,
Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When
Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements SAB108.
SAB108states that registrants should use both a
balance sheet approach and an income statement approach when
quantifying and evaluating the materiality of a misstatement.
SAB108 also contains guidance on correcting misstatements
under the dual approach and provides transition guidance for
correcting misstatements in prior years. Adjustments required
upon adoption of SAB108 must be disclosed in the notes to
the financial statements. The adoption of SABNo108
did not have a material effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.

of M-Solutions   On February6, 2006, we completed the sale of the assets of

Services Division, for $186million in cash, subject to
post-closing adjustments. The sale was the result of an
unsolicited offer and resulted in a gain on disposal of
$128million. As a result of this disposition, the
operating results of the M-Solutions business for the current
and prior periods through the disposition date have been
reclassified as discontinued operations in the Consolidated
Financial Statements and related notes. M-Solutions generated

Software Limited Acquisition   In April 2005, we completed the acquisition of Accurate Software
Limited Accurate, a United Kingdom-based provider
of reconciliation, exception management, workflow and business
intelligence solutions, for approximately $570million in
cash. We completed the acquisition of Accurate to further
solidify our leadership in financial software and services,
expand our global presence and client base, and drive continued
product innovation in operational risk management solutions for
banks, brokerages and corporations.   Accurate is part of our Software Division. We recorded assets
and liabilities based on their fair market values at the date of
the acquisition. Based on the purchase price allocation, we
recorded goodwill of approximately $401million, which is
not deductible for tax purposes. As a direct result of our
acquisition of Accurate, we recorded a charge in the amount of
$10million to write down the value of previously
capitalized software due to technology redundancy. This charge
is included in depreciation and amortization within our

REORGANIZATION
CHARGES   We are committed to a plan of integration of certain activities
with our fiscal 2007 acquisitions. These activities are
accounted for in accordance with
EITF95-3,
Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase
Business Combination
EITF95-3.
These activities include primarily employee severance and
related costs. In connection with those acquisitions, we accrued
reorganization charges totaling approximately
$103million. A charge of $61million was recorded
in our 2007 Statement of Income as a result of severance and
related costs associated with termination of a number of our
associates in connection with our integration plans. The balance
of the costs were included in the determination of the purchase
price as they related to the acquired companies associates.

223,557     86     2,336        221,307   The fair value of available-for-sale securities is based on
quoted market values or estimates from independent pricing
services.   We have determined that the unrealized losses in our
available-for-sale investments, comprised of 74 and 140
securities, are deemed to be temporary impairments as of
June30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We believe that the
unrealized losses generally are caused by increases in market
interest rates rather than adverse changes in cash flows or a
fundamental weakness in the credit quality of the issuer or
underlying assets. We believe that the investments full
principal will be returned to us at maturity.

182,471     181,541   Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities
because debt issuers may have the right to call or prepay
obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. We
classify, in our consolidated balance sheet, our investments
based on their expected maturities rather than contractual
maturities. During the quarter ended March31, 2005, we
began classifying our auction rate preferred and debt
instruments as available-for-sale rather than as cash and cash
equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet. As of
June30, 2007 and 2006, we had approximately
$1114million and $780million in auction rate
securities, respectively.   In 2007, available-for-sale investments of approximately
$3450million matured, and we recognized no gross gains or
gross losses on these maturities. In 2006, available-for-sale
investments of approximately $4660million, and we
recognized no gross gains or gross losses on these maturities.
In 2005, we sold available-for-sale securities of approximately
$2627million. We recognized gross gains of $4,000 and
gross losses of $40,000 on those sales.   The amount of the net unrealized holding gains or losses on
available-for-sale securities included in accumulated other
comprehensive income loss as of June30, 2007, 2006 and
2005 was $06million, $14million and
$04million, respectively. The amount of losses
reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income
loss into earnings for the fiscal years ended June30,
2007, 2006 and 2005 was $9,000, $0 and $24,000, respectively. We
use the specific identification method to determine the basis on
which the cost of a security is sold or the amount that we
reclassify out of the accumulated other comprehensive income
loss, a component of stockholders equity of our
consolidated balance sheet, into earnings.   In the quarter ended March31, 2005, we recorded a
$06million gain on the sale of stock. While we do not
typically invest in equity securities, we received shares of
stock from an insurance vendor that demutualized. We sold the
shares shortly after we received them, and recorded the proceeds
as a gain on investments.   Other
investments   We account for other investments under the cost method. Our
other investments include common stock, warrants and venture
capital initiatives. The common stocks and warrants consist of
preferred stock warrants in a non-publicly traded electronic
billing related company. The fair value of our investments was
approximately $26million and $01million as of
June30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.   Our venture capital investments are in early to mid-stage
financial solutions and technology companies. We have made a
commitment to invest $10million and $40million in
two separate venture capital initiatives. Actual contributions
are made at the point in time a specific company in which
venture capital will be invested is identified. The fair value
of our venture capital initiative with a $10million
commitment was approximately $07million and
$06million as of June30, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The cost and fair value of our venture capital
initiative with a $40million commitment was approximately
$13million and $06million as of June30, 2007
and 2006, respectively.   
97 Table of Contents   Pledged
investments   We have pledged certain available-for-sale investments as
collateral for payments due under our operating leases and have
three standby letters of credit related to our operating leases.
In conjunction with our operating leases, the total amount of
our collateralized available-for-sale investments and standby
letters of credit at June30, 2007 and 2006 was
approximately $07million and $24million,
respectively. The standby letters of credit associated with our
operating leases expire at various dates through February 2008
but automatically renew yearly through the underlying lease
expiration dates. Our operating leases expire at various dates
through October 2017.

FINANCING
AGREEMENTS   In August 2003, our wholly owned subsidiaries, CheckFree
Services and Bastogne, Inc., a bankruptcy-remote, special
purpose entity Bastogne, entered into a Master
Agreement with SunTrust Banks, Atlanta, Georgia
SunTrust with respect to activities in our
Electronic Commerce Division. Under this Master Agreement,
SunTrust provides us with Automated Clearing House
ACH and other electronics funds transfer services,
on behalf of Bastogne in connection with the receipt,
investment, custody and transmission of subscriber funds. In
addition, SunTrust and its affiliates provide us with various
deposit accounts and investment accounts and services to
Bastogne. CheckFree Services provides processing and
administrative services to Bastogne to facilitate transactions
under the Master Agreement.   SunTrust has agreed to provide a facility to Bastogne to cover
overdrafts occurring from time to time due to timing differences
between transmission of subscriber funds and movement of funds
from Bastognes investment accounts to the zero balance
demand deposit account maintained by Bastogne with SunTrust. In
addition, SunTrust provides ACH services, and maintains and
permits Bastogne to use SunTrusts MasterCard ICA transit
number and VISA bank identification numbers to facilitate
transactions in the MasterCard and VISA systems. The obligations
of Bastogne under the Master Agreement to SunTrust are
guaranteed by CheckFree Services.   Revolving
Credit Facility   On April13, 2006, we entered into a revolving credit
facility with SunTrust that provides for up to
$3000million in revolving credit loans, swingline loans
and the issuance of letters of credit. The credit facility
terminates on April13, 2011, unless terminated earlier.
Any borrowings will bear interest at certain rates based upon
our then current ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA. The
credit facility also requires the payment of a commitment fee,
expressed as a percentage per annum on any unused commitment. As
of June30, 2007, the amount outstanding under the facility
was $2040million at an average rate of 587%. The
interest charged on the facility fluctuates with changes in
short-term interest rates.   The credit facility contains certain financial covenants
requiring us to meet certain financial ratios and contains
certain operating covenants which, among other things, impose
certain limitations with respect to additional indebtedness,
investments, dividends and prepayments of subordinated
indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, asset sales, mergers
and consolidations, liens and other matters customarily
addressed in such agreements. The credit facility also contains
customary events of default, including payment defaults,
material inaccuracies in representations and warranties,
covenant defaults, cross-defaults to certain other agreements,
certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, certain ERISA
events, judgment defaults in excess of specified amounts,
failure of any guaranty supporting the credit facility to be in
full force and effect, and a change in control.   Data
Center Facility   On April13, 2006, we entered into a series of financing
and leasing arrangements the Agreements with a
consortium of banks for the purpose of funding the construction
of up to two data centers. We record the construction of the
data centers as construction in progress during the construction
period and will begin to record depreciation once we have
assumed occupancy. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreements,
SunTrust   
101 Table of Contents   purchased a fee simple interest in two parcels of real property
the Properties specified by CheckFree Services,
and CheckFree Services, as construction agent for SunTrust, is
required to construct data center facilities the
Facilities on the Properties. The funding for the
acquisition of the Properties and the construction of the
Facilities will be provided by SunTrust and certain financial
institutions. The aggregate limit on the funding to be provided
by SunTrust and the financial institutions is
$1000million. As of June30, 2007, the amount
outstanding under the facility was $401million at an
average rate of 603%. The interest charged on the facility
fluctuates with changes in short-term interest rates.   During construction and after completion of the Facilities,
SunTrust will lease the Properties and the Facilities to
CheckFree Services pursuant to the terms of the Agreements.
CheckFree Services will make minimum lease payments,
representing the interest charge on the outstanding balance,
beginning upon completion of construction that will vary based
on the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus a
spread. The lease agreements will expire on April15, 2013,
unless terminated earlier pursuant to the terms of the lease
agreements.   Upon expiration of the Agreements, CheckFree Services must elect
to: ipurchase the Facilities and Properties from
SunTrust for a defined amount; iirequest a five year
renewal of the lease agreements maximum of two such five year
renewals provided for, subject to the approval and consent of
SunTrust and the Lenders; or iiisell the Facilities and
Properties as agent for SunTrust, provided that certain
conditions are satisfied the Remarketing Option.   If CheckFree Services chooses the Remarketing Option, various
outcomes may occur under the Agreements, but if the net cash
proceeds of any sale are less than an amount equal to the
aggregate sum of the outstanding amounts funded by SunTrust and
all other lenders, all accrued and unpaid interest on the loans,
all unpaid fees owing to SunTrust and any other lender under the
operative documents, and all other amounts owing to SunTrust and
all other lenders under the lease agreements the
Outstanding Amounts, CheckFree Services will be
required to pay SunTrust the difference between the sale
proceeds and the Outstanding Amounts, but in no event more than
approximately eighty-three percent 83% for the property in
Texas and approximately eighty-five percent 85% for property
in Georgia of the Outstanding Amounts. If the net proceeds
received from a third party for the Properties and Facilities,
or a given Property and Facility, are in excess of the
Outstanding Amounts or the Outstanding Amounts related to the
specific Property and Facility, the excess shall be paid to
CheckFree Services. SunTrust or the Agent may reject a third
party purchase offer for the Properties and Facilities or a
given Property and Facility under certain conditions.   The Agreements contain certain financial covenants requiring us
to meet certain financial ratios and contains certain operating
covenants which, among other things, impose certain limitations
with respect to additional indebtedness, investments, dividends
and prepayments of subordinated indebtedness, transactions with
affiliates, asset sales, mergers and consolidations, liens and
other matters customarily addressed in such agreements. We are
in compliance with our covenants as of June30, 2007.

CAPITAL
LEASE AND OTHER LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS   We lease certain equipment under capital leases and purchase
certain software licenses under long-term agreements. We are
required to pay certain taxes, insurance and other expenses
related to the leased property.   The components of our capital leases included in our
consolidated balance sheets are as follows in thousands

agreements with extended payment terms. Total amounts due under
these agreements are not significant at June30, 2007.   On April2, 2004, we received a $250million deposit
from a customer in connection with a contract modification
relating to the timing of transaction settlements. The agreement
has an initial term of four years and automatically renews
thereafter unless terminated with 180days notice. We
expect the agreement to be renewed beyond April 2008. During the
term of the agreement, we are required to pay the customer a
variable rate of interest on a monthly basis equal to the then
current overnight repurchase agreement rate. The deposit is
reflected as a long-term liability in our consolidated balance
sheets. There are no restrictions on the deposit, and the funds
are available to us for general use. The deposit will be
refunded to our customer upon termination of the agreement.

COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES   Operating
Leases   We lease office space and equipment under operating leases.
Certain leases contain renewal options and generally provide
that we are required to pay for insurance, taxes and
maintenance. In addition, certain leases include rent
escalations throughout the terms of the lease. Total expense
under all operating lease agreements for the years ended
June30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $250million,
$210million and $200million, respectively.   Future minimum rental payments as of June30, 2007 under
these leases are as follows in thousands

103 Table of Contents   As previously explained in Note4, Pledged Investments, we
have pledged certain available-for-sale investments as
collateral for payments due under our operating leases and have
three standby letters of credit related to our operating leases.   Guarantees   FASB Interpretation 45, Guarantors Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others
FIN45, requires that a guarantor recognize,
at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value
of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee.   We warrant that our software products will perform in all
material respects in accordance with our standard published
specifications in effect at the time of delivery of the licensed
products to the customer for 90days. Additionally, we
warrant that our services will be performed consistent with
generally accepted industry standards or specific service levels
through completion of the agreed upon services. If necessary, we
would provide for the estimated cost of product and service
warranties based on specific warranty claims and claim history,
however, we have not incurred significant recurring expense
under our product or service warranties. As a result, we believe
the estimated liabilities related to these agreements are not
material.   We have entered into the following guarantees related to our
walk-in payment operations. The transmittal of consumer funds
for three customers is guaranteed. As of June30, 2007, we
have secured deposits and have issued surety bonds and letters
of credit totaling $253million on behalf of consumers in
the event that consumer funds are not remitted to billers.
Historically, payments made related to settling claims under
these arrangements have not been significant. As a result, we
believe the estimated fair value of any unsettled claims is
nominal. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded for these
arrangements as of June30, 2007.   OneVu, our joint venture, has a line of credit facility from a
bank in the amount of approximately $27million, which we
have guaranteed. See further discussion on our joint venture
with OneVu in Note1.   In connection with our MSFDC, L.L.C. TransPoint
acquisition in 2001, we entered into commercial agreements with
Microsoft and FDC to provide payment processing services. These
agreements included minimum guaranteed revenue commitments
totaling $1800million over five years. The monthly
minimum commitments from Microsoft and FDC increased over the
five year term of the agreements and expired during the fiscal
year 2006.   Litigation   On or about April10, 2007, the first of two related
shareholder securities putative class actions was filed against
CheckFree and Messrs.Peter J. Kight and David E. Mangum in
federal court in Atlanta styled as follows: Skubellav.
CheckFree Corporation, et al., Civil Action
No1:07-CV-0796-TWT,
United States District Court for the Northern District of
Georgia, Atlanta Division; Gattelarov. CheckFree
Corporation, et al., Civil Action
No1:07-CV-0945-TWT,
United States District Court for the Northern District of
Georgia, Atlanta Division. The actions were filed on behalf of a
putative class of all purchasers of CheckFree common stock
between April4, 2006 and August1, 2006 and allege
violations of Section10b of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 and
Rule10b-5
promulgated thereunder against CheckFree and the individual
defendants, as well as of Section20a against the
individual defendants, related to CheckFrees disclosures
concerning its Electronic Commerce and Payment Services
business. Plaintiffs seek undisclosed damages. On June29,
2007, the Court entered an order that, among other things,
consolidated these two actions and appointed Southwest
Carpenters Pension Trust as the Lead Plaintiff. We anticipate
that the Lead Plaintiff will file a consolidated complaint in
the near future.   A related derivative action was filed on or about June14,
2007 in federal court in Atlanta styled as follows:
Borroniv. Peter Kight, et al., Civil Action
No1:07-CV-1382-TWT,
United States District Court for the Northern District of
Georgia, Atlanta Division. The complaint names the following as
defendants: Peter Kight, Mark Johnson, William Boardman, James
D. Dixon, C. Kim Goodwin, Eugene F. Quinn, Jeffrey M. Wilkins,
and David Mangum. The complaint also names CheckFree Corporation
as a nominal defendant. The complaint alleges breach of
fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting, and contribution and
indemnification against the   
104 Table of Contents   individual defendants as well as unjust enrichment against one
of the individual defendants. Following CheckFrees
announcement of its proposed acquisition by Fiserv, Inc., the
plaintiffs filed a Corrected Verified First Amended Shareholder
Derivative and ClassAction Complaint on August6,
2007, which added C. Beth Cotner as a defendant and also added a
claim on behalf of a putative class of all holders of CheckFree
common stock for breach of fiduciary duty against all the
individual defendants related to their approval of the proposed
acquisition.   We believe these actions are without merit and intend to defend
vigorously. We intend to move to dismiss these lawsuits at the
appropriate time. At this time, it is not possible to predict
the outcome of these matters.

CAPITAL
STOCK   Our authorized capital shares consist of 500,000,000shares
of common stock, $01par value, 48,500,000shares of
preferred stock, $01par value, and 1,500,000shares
of SeriesA Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred
Stock, $01par value. The preferred stock may be issued in
one or more series and may be established with such relative
voting, dividend, redemption, liquidation, conversion and other
powers, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations and
restrictions as our board of directors may determine without
further stockholder approval. No preferred shares have been
issued through June30, 2007.   On December16, 1997, our board of directors declared a
dividend distribution of Preferred Share Purchase Rights
Rights to protect our stockholders in the event of
an unsolicited attempt to acquire us. On December19, 1997,
the Rights were issued to our stockholders of record, with an
expiration date of December16, 2007. Until a person or
group acquires 15% or more of our common stock, the Rights will
automatically trade with our shares of common stock. Only when a
person or group has acquired 15% or more of our common stock,
will the Rights become exercisable and separate certificates
issued. Prior to the acquisition by a person or group of
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common stock, the
Rights are redeemable for $001 per Right at the option of our
board of directors.   On August3, 2005, we announced that our board of directors
had approved a stock repurchase program under which we could
repurchase up to $600million of our common stock through
July31, 2006. During our fiscal year 2006, we repurchased
a total of 707,732shares at an average purchase price of
$4748 per share, or approximately $336million in the
aggregate. As of June30, 2006, the dollar value of the
shares that remained available for repurchase was approximately
$264million. The repurchased shares were immediately
retired and cancelled. This program expired on July31,
2006, with such remaining approved repurchase amount still
outstanding.   On August1, 2006, we announced that our board of directors
had approved a separate stock repurchase program under which we
could repurchase up to $1000million of our common stock
through July31, 2007. During the month of August 2006, we
repurchased a total of 2,176,158shares of common stock at
an average purchase price of $3722; in September 2006, we
repurchased a total of 461,589shares at an average
purchase price of $4115 per share, or approximately
$1000million in the aggregate. The repurchased shares
were immediately retired and cancelled.   On November6, 2006, we announced that our board of
directors had approved a separate stock repurchase program under
which we could repurchase up to $1000million of our
common stock through August1, 2007. During the month of
November 2006, we repurchased a total of 1,273,807shares
of common stock at an average purchase price of $3925 per
share, or approximately $500million in the aggregate. The
repurchased shares were immediately retired and cancelled.   
NOTE13.
TRANSACTIONS
INVOLVING EQUITY INSTRUMENTS   Employee
Plans   During 1995, we adopted the 1995 Stock Option Plan the
1995 Plan. The options granted under the 1995 Plan
may be either incentive stock options or non-statutory stock
options. The terms of the options granted under the 1995 Plan
are at the sole discretion of a committee of members of our
board of directors, not to exceed ten years. Generally, options
vest at either 33% or 20% per year from the date of grant. The
1995 Plan   
105 Table of Contents   originally provided us with the ability of granting options for
not more than 5,000,000shares of common stock to certain
of our key employees, officers and directors. In November 1998
and again in November 2000, the 1995 Plan was amended by a vote
of our shareholders to extend the maximum option grants to not
more than 8,000,000shares and not more than
12,000,000shares, respectively. Options granted under the
1995 Plan are exercisable according to the terms of each option,
however, in the event of a change in control or merger as
defined, the options shall become immediately exercisable.   In November 2002, our stockholders approved the 2002 Stock
Incentive Plan the 2002 Plan. Under the provisions
of the 2002 Plan, we have the ability to grant incentive or
non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights
SARs, restricted stock, performance units or
performance shares for not more than 6,000,000shares of
common stock such shares to be supplied from the
12,000,000shares approved for the 1995 Plan to certain of
our key employees, officers and non-employee directors. The
terms of the options, SARs, restricted stock, performance units
or performance shares granted under the 2002 Plan are determined
by a committee of our Board of Directors, however, in the event
of a change in control as defined in the 2002 Plan, they shall
become immediately exercisable.   The 2002 Plan replaced the 1995 Plan, except that the 1995 Plan
continues to exist to the extent that options granted prior to
the effective date of the 2002 Plan continue to remain
outstanding. At June30, 2007, there were 2,592,599
additional shares available for grant under the 2002 Plan.   In the event that shares purchased through the exercise of
incentive stock options are sold within one year of exercise, we
are entitled to a tax deduction. The tax benefit of the
deduction is not reflected in our consolidated statements of
operations but is reflected as an increase in additional paid-in
capital.   As of June30, 2007, we have three types of share-based
payment arrangements with our associates; stock options,
restricted stock and associate stock purchase plan.

value of options granted during the period
1439   The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in the
years ended June30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively:
dividend yield of 0% in all periods; expected volatility of 49   50% and 55%; risk-free interest rates 490%, 467% and 315   and expected lives of three to seven years. We have used the
simplified method as provided by Staff Accounting
Bulletin107, Share Based Payment, to estimate
the expected life of stock options granted during the years
ended June30, 2007, 2006 and 2005. This method   
107 Table of Contents   allows us to estimate the expected life using the average of the
vesting period and the contractual life of the stock options
granted.   As of June30, 2007, we had approximately $41million
of unearned compensation related to nonvested stock options,
which we will record in our statement of operations over a
weighted average recognition period of approximately
2years.   In June 2003, we made an offer the Tender Offer to
certain of our employees to exchange options with exercise
prices greater than or equal to $4400 per share outstanding
under our 1983 Incentive Stock Option Plan, 1983 Non-Statutory
Stock Option Plan, 1993 Stock Option Plan, Third Amended and
Restated 1995 Plan, BlueGill Technologies, Inc. 1997 Stock
Option Plan, BlueGill Technologies, Inc. 1998 Incentive and
Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, and 2002 Plan, for restricted
stock units of our common stock, and in certain cases, cash
payments.   Restricted stock units issued under the Tender Offer vest
ratably over a three-year period. The offer period closed on
July17, 2003, and employees holding 1,165,035 options
participated in the Tender Offer. We made cash payments totaling
$586,000 in July 2003 representing the cash consideration
portion of the Tender Offer, and we issued approximately
153,000shares of restricted stock under the 2002 Plan
during July 2006. We recorded an expense of $0,
$16million and $21million for the years ended
June30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, for cash
payments made and the vesting of restricted stock units. On
July19, 2004, we issued 51,143shares relating to the
portion of the Tender Offer that vested on July17, 2004.
In total, 80,588shares actually vested, of which
29,445shares were retained by us to fund the
employees payroll taxes associated with the vesting. On
July19, 2005, we issued 42,756shares relating to the
portion of the Tender Offer that vested on July17, 2005.
In total, 67,174shares actually vested, of which
24,418shares were retained by us to fund the
employees payroll taxes associated with the vesting. On
July17, 2006, we issued 38,998shares relating to the
portion of the Tender Offer that vested on July17, 2006.
In total, 62,239shares actually vested, of which
23,241shares were retained by us to fund the
employees payroll taxes associated with the vesting.   Restricted
Stock   Beginning in fiscal year 2005, we adopted a Long-Term Incentive
Compensation LTIC program to replace our
traditional equity based compensation program. Under the LTIC
program, we grant a smaller number of options and shares of
restricted stock under the 2002 Plan. We do not treat shares of
restricted stock as issued and outstanding on our balance sheet
until the restrictions lapse. Our disclosure of vested shares
includes shares which are never issued because they are withheld
to fund employees payroll taxes. We withheld
5,875shares under the LTIC program during the year ended
June30, 2007 to fund employees payroll taxes. Our
annual LTIC grants occur in the first quarter of each fiscal
year. The shares of restricted stock granted under the LTIC
program have a five-year vesting period with an accelerated
vesting provision of three years based on achievement of
specific goals and objectives. We recorded an expense of
approximately $64million, $28million, and
$26million for the years ended June30, 2007, 2006,
and 2005, respectively, related to the vesting of restricted
stock under the LTIC.   The following tables summarize the activity of restricted stock

456,676     2616   As of June30, 2007, we had approximately
$107million of nonvested restricted stock which we will
record in our statement of operations over a recognition period
of approximately five years.   Associate
Stock Purchase Plan   Under our 2006 Associate Stock Purchase Plan the 2006
Plan, we are authorized to issue up to 20million
shares of our common stock to our full-time employees, nearly
all of whom are eligible to participate. On July27, 2006,
our board of directors approved the adoption of the 2006 Plan,
and on November1, 2006, at the 2006 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders, stockholders approved and adopted the 2006 Plan.
The 2006 Plan replaced our Third Amended and Restated Associate
Stock Purchase Plan, which expired on December31, 2006.
The total number of shares available for awards increased under
the 2006 Plan from 10million to 20million shares.
Under the terms of the 2006 Plan, our employees can choose,
every six months, to have up to 15% of their salary withheld to
purchase our common stock.   The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the end-of-period
market price. On June13, 2005, we amended our Associate
Stock Purchase Plan to remove a look-back feature which
established the purchase price as 85% of the lower of the
beginning-of-period and end-of-period market price.
Participation in the plan by eligible employees has ranged from
25% to 50% in any given six-month period. Under the Associate
Stock Purchase Plan, we issued 70,576shares in January
2007, 53,066shares in July 2006, 54,390 in January 2006,
67,204shares in July 2005, 92,805 in January 2005, 72,293
in July 2004 and 74,952 in January 2004 from our employees
salary withholdings from the respective previous six-month
period. As of June30, 2007, there are
1,929,424shares available for future issuance to our
employees under our Associate Stock Purchase Plan. In July 2007,
we issued an additional 60,566shares. For the year ended
June30, 2007, we recorded an expense of approximately
$08million under the provisions of SFAS123R for
our Associate Stock Purchase Plan.   401 k
Plan   In January 1997, our board of directors approved an amendment to
our 401k plan, which authorized up to 10million shares
of our common stock to be used by us to match our employee
contributions to our 401k plan. Our board of directors
authorized an additional 10million shares of our common
stock for the matching contribution in November 2002. We issued
68,102shares in January 2007, 108,785shares in
August 2006, 82,242shares in August 2005 and
108,484shares in August 2004 to fund our 401k match that
had accrued during the years ended June30, 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.   109 Table of Contents   Effective January1, 2007, our 401 kplan fiscal
year changed from June 30 to December31. This resulted in
a short
6-month
fiscal year for the 401 kplan beginning July1,
2006 and ending December31, 2006. Prior to January1,
2007, we made an annual employer match to the 401 kplan
in the form of CheckFree common stock, which was calculated and
distributed into participants accounts at the end of each
fiscal year. Beginning January1, 2007, we will no longer
match contributions with our common stock, but rather, will make
our employer match in cash, on a semi-monthly basis. The
employer match, effective January1, 2007, is guaranteed at
50% of the employees semi-monthly contribution, up to 6%
of eligible earnings in that period.   Stock
Related Transactions With Third Parties   In October 2000, we completed an agreement to acquire various
electronic billing and payment assets from Bank of America in
exchange for 100million shares of our common stock,
$350million in cash and warrants to acquire an additional
100million shares of our common stock. In connection with
a December2003 modification of the terms of our processing
services agreement with Bank of America, the amount of shares
available under the warrants was reduced to 50million.
Bank of America has the ability to earn warrants for up to
50million shares, 30million of which vest upon
achievement of specific levels of active subscriber adoption of
electronic billing and payment services and 20million of
which vest upon achievement of specific levels of electronic
bills delivered, as defined. The warrants have a strike price of
$3250 and expire on September30, 2010.   In February 2007, Bank of America achieved the first level of
active subscriber adoption of electronic billing and paying
services and as a result 10million warrants vested. Prior
to February 2007, we did not believe it was probable that any of
the warrants would vest. Accordingly, during February 2007, we
recorded an $110million charge for the fair value of the
1,000,000 warrants earned to date. The charge for these warrants
was recorded as a reduction of processing and service revenue
received from Bank of America. Fair value was determined based
on a Black-Scholes option pricing model valuation. We currently
believe it is not probable that the warrants for the remaining
40million unvested shares will vest, and as a result, no
charge for the fair value of these warrants has been recorded.   In October 1999, we entered into an agreement with one of our
customers. Under the terms of the agreement, the customer
purchased 250,000shares of our common stock and has been
issued warrants on 10million shares. All warrants reflect
a strike price of $3925 and became exercisable on
September15, 2002. Fair value was determined based on a
Black-Scholes option pricing model valuation. Warrants to
acquire 10million shares of our common stock remain
outstanding at June30, 2007.   In January 1998, we entered into a ten-year processing agreement
with a strategic partner. Under the terms of the agreement, the
partner acquired ten-year warrants for 100million shares
of our common stock exercisable at $20 15/16. 30million
warrants vested upon the execution of a related processing
outsourcing agreement in March 1998. Of the vested warrants,
only 15million remain outstanding at June30, 2007.

EMPLOYEE
BENEFIT PLANS   Retirement
Plan   We have a defined contribution 401k retirement plan covering
substantially all of our
U.S.-based
employees. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute a
portion of their salary until retirement and we match a portion
of our employees contribution See Note13. Total
expense under this plan amounted to $55million,
$41million and $30million for the years ended
June30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.   Pension
Plan   We have a defined contribution pension plan for our eligible
United Kingdom employees. Total contributions amounted to
$10million, $08million and $04million for
the years ended June30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.   Deferred
Compensation Plan   In January 1999, we established a deferred compensation plan
the DCP, covering our highly compensated employees
as defined by the DCP. Under the plan, eligible employees may
contribute a portion of their salary on a pre-tax basis. The DCP
is a non-qualified plan; therefore, the associated liabilities
are included in our consolidated balance sheets as of
June30, 2007 and 2006. In addition, we have established a
rabbi trust to finance our obligations under the DCP with
corporate-owned life insurance policies on participants. The
cash surrender value of such policies is also included in our
consolidated balance sheets as of June30, 2007 and 2006.
Total net income expense under the DCP for the years ended
June30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 amounted to $84,000, $74,000
and $229,000, respectively.   Group
Medical Plans   Since 2000, all of our
U.S.-based
employees receive medical coverage under a group medical
self-insurance plan. We have employed an administrator to manage
this plan. Under terms of this plan, both we and eligible
employees are required to make contributions. The administrator
reviews all claims filed and authorizes the payment of benefits.
We have stop-loss insurance coverage on all individual claims
exceeding $300,000. We provide supplemental medical insurance
coverage to our non
U.S.-based
employees. Total expenses for medical insurance coverage
including premiums amounted to $184million,
$172million and $161million for the years ended
June30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Under the
self-insurance plan, we expense amounts as claims are incurred
and liabilities are recorded for incurred but not reported
claims. At June30, 2007 and 2006, we accrued
$38million and $29million, respectively, as a
liability for costs incurred but not paid under this plan.   
NOTE16.
DERIVATIVE
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   From time to time we have entered into derivative financial
instruments to manage our exposure to the variability associated
with the interest rate sensitive portion of our processing and
servicing revenue, specifically, to effectively fix the interest
rate on a portion of our interest rate sensitive revenue. At
inception, we formally designate and document our swaps as cash
flow hedges of the variability in interest rate sensitive
revenue and state the risk management objectives and strategies
for undertaking the hedge transaction. In 2004 and 2005, we
entered into various interest rate swaps with aggregate notional
amounts of $75million. All of these swaps have expired at
June30, 2007. Each of these swaps were considered
effective and had no material effect on our financial results
during each of the years in which they were in place.

10,691     3,348     Net deferred tax assets
74,151     49,587   As of June30, 2007, we had federal net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $1318million and federal
tax credit carryforwards of approximately $35million. The
net operating loss carryforwards are subject to the limitations
of Internal Revenue Code Section382, and expire between
the years
2022-2027;
the credit carryforwards expire in the years 2012- 2026. We have
approximately $06 million of valuation allowance related to our
SFAS 123R deferred tax assets that we do not expect to be
realized. In addition, we had state net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $2235million and state tax
credits of approximately $18million; these carryforwards
expire over various periods based on jurisdiction. Because we do
not generate sufficient taxable income in certain jurisdictions,
it is our opinion that it is more likely than not that the
benefit of the deferred tax assets related to certain state net
operating losses and credits will not be realized. Accordingly,
a valuation allowance of approximately $55million has
been recorded for the year ended June30, 2007. Of this
balance, approximately $20million of the future tax
benefit, if realized, from the reversal of the valuation
allowance would be allocable as a reduction of goodwill. In
addition, we have tax credits of approximately $25million
and net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$164million in various foreign jurisdictions as of
June30, 2007. The credit carryforwards begin to expire in
2013; the net operating loss carryforwards have an indefinite
life. Based on historical and future income projections, it is
our opinion that it is more likely than not that the benefit of
tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards in certain
foreign jurisdictions will not be realized; therefore, a
valuation allowance totaling approximately $46million as
of June30, 2007 has been recorded against these deferred
tax assets. Of this balance, approximately $24million of
the future tax benefit, if realized, from the reversal of the
valuation allowance would be allocable as a reduction of
goodwill.   In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to
examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may
result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing
authorities and we have accrued a liability when we believe it
is probable that it will be assessed. The Internal Revenue
Service IRS has completed an examination of our
June30, 2004 tax returns with no material assessment made
and has   
113 Table of Contents   commenced an examination of our June30, 2005 tax returns.
The tax attributes of certain positions we have taken on our
statutory tax filings are complex and may be challenged by the
taxing authorities. Therefore, we have provided a reserve of
approximately $78million and $96million for future
resolution of our uncertain tax matters, as of June30,
2007 and 2006, respectively. While we believe the tax reserve is
adequate, the ultimate resolution of these tax matters may
exceed or be below the reserve.   We entered into a strategic transaction in fiscal year 1999
whereby we recorded a one time tax deduction of approximately
$300million and additional tax deductions of
approximately $380million over the next five years. We
believe that this transaction was executed appropriately and in
accordance with the prevailing tax law. Such deductions will not
be finalized until an examination of our June30, 2005 tax
returns has been completed. The IRS examination currently in
process may result in assessments of additional taxes that are
resolved either with the IRS or potentially through the courts.   We do not provide for U.S.federal and state income taxes
on the cumulative undistributed earnings of our foreign
subsidiaries because such earnings are reinvested and will
continue to be reinvested indefinitely. At June30, 2007 we
had not provided for federal income taxes on earnings of
approximately $08million from our foreign subsidiaries.
Should these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or
otherwise, we would be subject to both U.S.income taxes
and withholding taxes in various international jurisdictions.
These taxes could potentially be partially offset by
U.S.foreign tax credits. Determination of the amount of
unrecognized deferred U.S.tax liability is not practical
because of the complexities associated with this hypothetical
calculation.

BUSINESS
SEGMENTS   We operate in three business segments Electronic
Commerce, Software and Investment Services. These reportable
segments are strategic business units that offer different
products and services. A further description of each of our
business segments along with the Corporate services area follows   
Electronic Commerce Our Electronic Commerce
products and services enable consumers to   
review bank accounts   
receive and pay bills over the Internet;and   
pay billers directly through biller-direct sites, by telephone
or through our walk-in retail agent network.   Consumers using our services access CheckFrees system
primarily through CSPs, billers and retail agents. CSPs are
organizations, such as banks, credit unions, brokerage firms and
Internet portals. Consumers can also access our system through
CheckFree hosted biller direct sites   
114 Table of Contents   www.mycheckfree.com, a network of retail agents for
walk-in bill payments, or by phone on hosted interactive voice
response applications.   
Software Software provides software and
services, including software, maintenance, support and
consulting services, through four product lines. These product
lines are Global Treasury, Reconciliation and Exception
Management, Transaction Process Management encompassing
financial messaging and corporate actions, and Electronic
Billing. Through our acquisition of Carreker in April 2007, we
expanded our offerings into four additional product lines:
Payments, Risk, Cash and Logistics and Global Payments
Consulting GPC.   
Investment Services Investment Services
Division provides a range of portfolio management services to
financial institutions, including broker dealers, money
managers, investment advisors, banks and insurance companies,
deliver portfolio management, enhanced trading solutions,
performance measurement and reporting services to their clients.   
Corporate Corporate services include human
resources, legal, finance and accounting and various other of
our unallocated overhead charges.   The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
described in Note1 Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies. We evaluate the performance of our segments
based on total revenues and operating income loss of the
respective segments. Segment operating income loss excludes
acquisition-related intangible asset amortization related to
various business and asset acquisitions, the impact of warrants
issued a customer, the impact of purchase accounting on deferred
revenue, integration costs associated with acquisitions,
reorganization charges, the write-off of capitalized software
and the SFAS123R equity-based compensation expense
related to stock options granted before the implementation of
our current incentive compensation philosophy beginning
July1, 2004, which significantly reduces overall
participation and focuses on restricted stock awards with
limited stock option grants.

SUBSEQUENT
EVENTS   Pending
Acquisition   On August2, 2007, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger Merger Agreement pursuant to which Fiserv,
Inc. Fiserv will acquire all of our outstanding
shares of common stock and common stock equivalents for $4800
per share in cash. Fiserv is a publicly traded NASDAQ company
headquartered in Brookfield, Wisconsin and is a provider of
technology solutions. We expect the transaction to close by
December31, 2007, subject to approval by our stockholders
and certain regulatory agencies.   In addition, on August2, 2007, we and Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, the Rights Agent executed a
fourth amendment to the Rights Agreement, dated as of
December16, 1997 the Rights Agreement, by
and between us and the Rights Agent as successor to The Fifth
Third Bank, as amended the Fourth Amendment. The
Fourth Amendment provides that, among other things, neither the
execution of the Merger Agreement nor the consummation of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement will trigger the separation or exercise of the Rights
or any adverse event under the Rights Agreement.   Sale-Leaseback
Transaction   During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2008 we closed on a
sale-leaseback transaction related to a property we own in
Dublin, Ohio. Under the terms of the agreement, we received net
proceeds of approximately $22million from the sale and
agreed to a
12-year
lease of the facility.

Controls
and Procedures.   Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission
SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information we are required to disclose in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.   As of the end of the period covered by this report, our
management, with the participation of our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, carried out an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
pursuant to
Rule13a-15
promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based upon this evaluation,
our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer
concluded that, as of June30, 2007, our disclosure
controls and procedures were 1designed to ensure that
material information relating to our company is accumulated and
made known to our management, including our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, in a timely manner,
particularly during the period in which this report was being
prepared and 2effective, in that they provide reasonable
assurance that information we are required to disclose in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SECs rules and forms.   Management believes, however, that a controls system, no matter
how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute
assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met,
and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control and instances of fraud, if any, within a
company have been detected.   Management
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. With the
participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework and criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework, issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The scope of managements assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
includes all of our businesses except for Carreker Corporation,
which was acquired on April2, 2007, Corillian Corporation,
which was acquired on May15, 2007, and Upstream
Technologies LLC, of which substantially all the assets were
acquired on May31, 2007, and whose combined financial
statements constitute 228 percent of total assets and 24
percent of revenues, of the consolidated financial statement
amounts as of and for the year ended June30, 2007. Further
discussion of these acquisitions can be found in Note2 to
our consolidated financial statements. Based on this evaluation,
our management has concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of June30, 2007.   Our independent auditor, Deloitte Touche LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, has issued a
report on our managements assessment of our internal
control over financial reporting. This report appears on
page74 of this Annual Report on
Form10-K.   Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   There has been no change in our internal control over financial
reporting as defined in
Rules13a-15f
and
15d-15f
promulgated under the Exchange Act during our fiscal quarter
ended June30, 2007, that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.
