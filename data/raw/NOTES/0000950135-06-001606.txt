Color Kinetics Incorporated and subsidiaries the
Company as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and
the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity deficiency and comprehensive income
loss, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December31, 2005. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Color Kinetics Incorporated and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2005, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.   We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on the

Nature of
Business and Basis of Presentation   Nature of BusinessColor Kinetics
Incorporated, incorporated in Delaware on September15,
1997, is a pioneer in the design, marketing and licensing of LED
lighting systems. We sell our products through our direct sales
force and network of manufacturers representatives and
distributors.   Basis of PresentationIn light of recent
views expressed by the Securities and Exchange Commission with
respect to accounting for auction rate securities
ARS, we have reclassified the accompanying
December31, 2004 consolidated balance sheet so as to no
longer report ARS as cash equivalents. We now report ARS on our
balance sheet as investments. The amount reclassified from cash
and equivalents to investments at December31, 2004 was
$30million. We also reclassified net cash used for
investing activities within the consolidated statement of cash
flows for 2004 to conform to this presentation. The
reclassifications to the prior year financial statements did not
affect our key financial indicators such as total cash and
investments, total assets, stockholders equity, revenues,
income from operations, net income, diluted earnings per share
or cash flows from operating activities. In addition, we do not
believe a readers ability to understand other key aspects
of our financial position or operations that might be pertinent
to an investment decision has been affected as a result of the
reclassifications.   We also reclassified certain other amounts for 2004 and 2003 to
conform to the 2005 presentation.   Principles of ConsolidationThe
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Color
Kinetics Incorporated and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Our
consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. All intercompany transactions and balances
have been eliminated in consolidation. We hold a 50% equity
interest in a joint venture, Color Kinetics Japan Incorporated
CK Japan. This investment is accounted for using
the equity method see Note9.   
2.
Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   Use of EstimatesThe preparation of
consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.   Cash and Equivalents and Restricted
CashWe consider all short-term highly
liquid investments purchased with remaining maturities of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.   We provided to the lessor of our corporate headquarters an
irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank with a defined
pay-down provision over the term of the lease. At
December31, 2005 and 2004, $900,000 and $10million,
respectively, was classified as long-term restricted cash and
$100,000 and $100,000, respectively, was classified as
short-term restricted cash, representing cash held on deposit
with a bank to secure the letter of credit.   Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe
carrying amount of our cash, accounts receivable and accounts
payable approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of
these instruments. We base the fair value of investments
available for sale on current market value see Note3.   InvestmentsInvestments, which consist
primarily of municipal and U.S. Treasury obligations and
corporate debt securities purchased with remaining maturities of
more than three months, are classified as investments available
for sale and stated at fair value. Aggregate unrealized holding
gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity
see Note3.

equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization
are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the related assets three years for computer
equipment, five years for furniture and fixtures, one year for
tooling and test equipment, and the remaining term of the lease
for leasehold improvements. Upon sale or retirement of assets,
the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization is
eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gains
or losses are reflected in operations. Expenditures for repairs
and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.   Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsWe
evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to
be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying
amount of an asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows
expected to be generated by the assets. If expected undiscounted
cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount,
the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by
which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of
the assets. In connection with our 2001 restructuring plan see
Note10, we wrote off certain leasehold improvements
related to the abandonment of a portion of our principal office
facility. No other impairments have been noted or recorded to
date.   Warranty ReserveOur products are
generally warranted against defects for 12months following
purchase. Reserves for potential warranty claims are provided at
the time of revenue recognition based on historical claims
experience, repair costs and current sales levels. Activity
within the reserve was as follows for the years ended

876     860     404   Revenue RecognitionWe recognize
revenues in connection with sales of our lighting systems and
OEM products when all of the following conditions have been met:
1evidence exists of an arrangement with the customer,
typically consisting of a purchase order or contract;
2our products have been delivered and title and risk of
loss has passed to the customer, which typically occurs when a
product is shipped under our customary terms, generally FOB
shipping point; 3the amount of revenue to which we are
entitled is fixed or determinable; and   
39 Table of Contents   Color
Kinetics Incorporated
Notes to
Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   4we believe it is probable that we will be able to
collect the amount due to us from our customer. To the extent
that one or more of these conditions is not present, we delay
recognition of revenue until all the conditions are present. We
classify the amount of freight that is invoiced to our customers
as revenue, with the corresponding cost classified as cost of
revenues.   We offer our lighting systems customers limited rights of
return, which typically provide that within 30days of
shipment products in unopened and saleable condition may, at our
discretion, be returned to us for refund, net of a 15%
restocking fee. We also provide certain distributors with
limited stock rotation rights. Based on historical experience,
we provide for potential returns from customers through a sales
return reserve, included in accrued expenses. The reserve is
evaluated and adjusted as conditions warrant. An allowance for
doubtful accounts is provided to reserve for credit losses as a
result of customers inability to pay.   Activity within the allowance for doubtful accounts was as

$367,000, $184,000, and $300,000 for the years ended
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.   Income TaxesDeferred tax assets and
liabilities are provided based upon the differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of
existing assets and liabilities and for loss and credit
carryforwards, using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect
when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax
assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely
than not that these assets may not be realized.   Stock-Based CompensationAt
December31, 2005, we had three stock-based compensation
plans, which are described in Note6. We apply the
intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options granted
to employees, as well as for common stock issued under our 2004
Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP. We apply the
fair value method for stock options and awards granted to
non-employees.   In accordance with the intrinsic value method, we determine the
compensation associated with stock awards to employees as the
difference, if any, between the fair value of the underlying
common stock on the date compensation is measured and the price
an employee must pay to exercise the award. The measurement date
for employee awards is generally the date of grant. Under the
fair value method, we determine the compensation associated with
stock awards to non-employees based on the estimated fair value
of the award, measured using either current market data or an
established option pricing model. The measurement date for
non-employee awards is generally the date the performance of
services is complete.

The ESPP was established in 2004; accordingly, valuation factors
are not applicable for years prior to 2004.   A weighted average volatility factor of 00% was used for option
grants prior to our June22, 2004 initial public offering
date.   The weighted average fair value of options granted for the years
ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $693, $558,
and $050, respectively. The weighted average fair value of the
option feature contained in shares awarded under the ESPP for
the year ended December31, 2005 and 2004 was $408 and
$366, respectively.   The Black-Scholes option pricing model used was designed to
value readily tradable stock options with relatively short
lives. The options granted to employees are not tradable and
have contractual lives of 10years.   
41 Table of Contents   Color

Notes to

StatementsContinued   However, management believes that the assumptions used and the
model applied to value the awards yields a reasonable estimate
of the fair value of the grants made under the circumstances.   In 2003 and 2002, we granted options to purchase 5,625 and
61,375shares of our common stock, respectively, to
non-employee advisors. Stock-based compensation expense related
to these options was recognized over the four-year vesting
period as the services were rendered. For the years ended
December31, 2004 and 2003, we recognized stock-based
compensation expense associated with these non-employee advisors
of approximately $325,000 and $76,000, respectively. Included in
the 2004 compensation charge was approximately $147,000
associated with acceleration of the remaining unvested portion
of these options, representing the fair value of the awards on
the June 2004 acceleration date.   For purposes of computing stock-based compensation expense, the
estimated fair value of non-employee advisor options was
determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model using
risk-free interest rates ranging from 236% to 408%, a dividend
yield of 00%, a weighted average expected life in years of 40
and a volatility factor of 500%.   Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Concentration of Credit
RiskFinancial instruments that potentially
expose us to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of
cash and equivalents, investments and accounts receivable. We
have no significant off-balance-sheet risks such as those
associated with foreign exchange contracts, option contracts or
other foreign exchange hedging arrangements. With respect to
concentration of credit risk, we have cash investment policies
which, among other things, limit investments to investment-grade
securities.   We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and
maintain allowances for potential credit losses, and such losses
have been within managements expectations.   During the year ended December31, 2005, no customer
accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. During the
year ended December31, 2004, we had two customers, CK
Japan and Color Kinetics Distribution, Inc. an unrelated
party, that accounted for 11% and 13% of total revenues,
respectively. During the year ended December31, 2003, we
had one customer, CK Japan, that accounted for 17% of total
revenues. At December31, 2005, we had one customer that
accounted for 11% of total accounts receivable. At
December31, 2004, we had twocustomers that accounted
for 17% and 12% of total accounts receivable.   Geographic InformationWe have derived

LossComprehensive income loss includes
all changes in equity during a period except those resulting
from investing by owners and distributions to owners. For the
years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, comprehensive
income loss is composed of our net income loss and currency
translation adjustments. For the years ended December31,
2005 and 2004, comprehensive income also includes unrealized
holding losses on our
available-for-sale
investments.   New Accounting PronouncementsIn
December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No123R, Share-Based
Payment SFASNo123R. This
Statement is a revision of SFASNo123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related
implementation guidance. SFASNo123R focuses
primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity
obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions.
The Statement requires entities to recognize compensation
expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on
the grant-date fair value of those awards with limited
exceptions. SFASNo123R is effective for the first
quarter of the first annual reporting period that begins after
June15, 2005. We will adopt SFASNo123R on
January1, 2006 using the modified-prospective method.   Adoption of SFASNo123R will materially increase our
stock compensation expense and decrease our net income and basic
and diluted earnings per share. However, adoption of
SFASNo123R will have no impact on our financial
position. For the first quarter of 2006, total stock-based
compensation expense, including amounts from the issuance of
stock options using the fair value provisions of
SFASNo123R, is estimated to be between
approximately $500,000 and $700,000. In order to develop the
first quarter 2006 stock-based compensation expense estimate, we
utilized assumptions, including, among other items, projected
option grants and expected life and volatility.
SFASNo123R also requires that the excess tax
benefits related to stock compensation be reported as a cash
inflow from financing activities rather than as a reduction of
taxes paid in cash from operations. The impact of the adoption
of SFASNo123R beyond the first quarter of 2006
cannot be predicted at this time because it will be depend on
levels of share-based payments granted in the future.   On November29, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No151,
Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research
Bulletin No43, Chapter4. SFAS No151
clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. SFAS
No151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during
years beginning after June15, 2005. We do not believe
adoption of SFAS No151 will have a material effect on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.   In May 2005, the FASB issued SFASNo154,
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.
SFASNo154 replaces APB Opinion No20,
Accounting Changes and SFASNo3, Reporting
Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements.
SFASNo154 requires companies to apply a
retrospective application for reporting a change in accounting
principle and differentiates a retrospective application from a
restatement. This Statement also carries forward the guidance
from APB Opinion No20 regarding the correction of an
error and changes in accounting estimates. We do not anticipate
any impact on our financial statements from the adoption of this
Statement.

Line of
Credit   We had a line of credit with a bank under which we were
permitted to borrow up to the lesser of $3,000,000 or 80% of
qualified accounts receivable, as defined in the agreement. The
line of credit expired unused in September 2004, and we
presently have no plans to obtain additional bank financing. We
had no outstanding borrowings at December31, 2005 and 2004.   During the year ended December31, 2003, we repaid $100,000
under previous working capital and equipment lines of credit
with the bank.

Earnings
Loss Per Share   Basic earnings loss per share is calculated using the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings
loss per share is computed on the basis of the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of
outstanding stock options, stock warrants, and redeemable
convertible preferred stock using the treasury stock method. Due
to our net loss for the year ended December31, 2003, the
effect of these items would be antidilutive in that period and,
accordingly, is excluded from the computation. Preferred shares

on June22, 2004 were included in the weighted average
computations of diluted earnings per share until the date of
actual conversion on an if-converted basis and in the weighted
average computations of basic earnings per share from the date
of such conversion.   For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003,
outstanding stock options to purchase approximately 527,000,
50,000 and 633,000shares of common stock, respectively,
were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings loss
per share, because these options were antidilutive.   A reconciliation of shares used in the computation of basic

Stock OptionsWe have two
shareholder-approved stock option plans: the 1998 Stock Option
Plan 1998 Plan and the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan
2004 Plan. These plans permit the granting of
stock awards to officers, members of the Board of Directors,
employees and consultants. The 1998 Plan terminated in 2004 and
no further awards may be granted under it, but existing awards
remain outstanding in accordance with their terms. Awards under
the 2004 Plan may include stock options both incentive and
nonqualified, restricted and unrestricted grants of stock,
grants of stock contingent upon the attainment of performance
goals, and stock appreciation rights. The 2004 Plan authorizes
the grant of up to 1,500,000shares of common stock and
includes an evergreen feature so that such number
will automatically increase on June25thof each year
from 2005 through 2009 by 150,000shares per year. The
maximum cumulative number of shares with respect to which awards
may be granted under the 2004 Plan is 2,250,000. The options
generally vest over four years and have terms of ten years. At
December31, 2005, a total of 1,650,000 options to purchase
common stock are issuable under these plans, of which
379,593shares were available for grant. No awards other
than incentive and nonqualified stock options have been granted
under the foregoing plans.

and recent transactions in our capital stock.

Notes to
Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   Employee Stock Purchase PlanThe ESPP
permits eligible employees to purchase up to a maximum of
150,000shares of our common stock and contains an
evergreen feature whereby such number shall increase
on each of the first five anniversaries of the effective date of
this plan by the lesser of 50,000shares or an amount
determined by the Board of Directors. The maximum shares
available for issuance and purchase by employees is 400,000. The
purchase price is determined as the lesser of 85% of the market
value of such shares at the beginning or end of a six-month
offering period. However, for the initial offering period of the
ESPP, the purchase price was determined based on the lesser of
the IPO price of $1000per share on June22, 2004 and
the market close price on January31, 2005. We have issued
31,517shares under the ESPP as of December31, 2005.
At December31, 2005, a total of 200,000shares of
common stock are issuable under the plan, of which
168,483shares were available for issuance.   WarrantsIn November 1998, we issued to
two members of our Board of Directors ClassA warrants to
acquire a total of 410,189shares of common stock at
$238per share, and ClassB warrants to acquire a
total of 149,149shares of its common stock at
$298per share. The warrants vested 50% upon grant date
and the remainder vested monthly over two years following grant
date. We computed the fair value for 50% of the warrants using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The value of these
warrants was immaterial to the financial statements. The
remaining 50% of the warrants are for services as members of the
Board of Directors and are accounted for using the intrinsic
value method. In July 2004, we issued 5,229shares of
common stock in a cashless exercise of ClassA and
ClassB warrants. The remaining warrants outstanding are
fully vested at December31, 2005.   SharesReserved for Future
IssuanceAt December31, 2005,
approximately 45million shares of common stock are
reserved for issuance on the exercise of outstanding stock
options under the 1998 Plan and warrants, and the issuance of
common stock under the 2004 Plan and the ESPP.

Income
Taxes   As of December31, 2005, we had federal net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $295million available to
offset future taxable income, if any. In addition, we have
approximately $12million of federal and state research
and development tax credits available to reduce future taxes
payable. These loss and credit carryforwards and credits expire
in varying amounts beginning in 2008 through 2023. The
occurrence of certain events, including significant changes in
ownership interests, may limit the amount of those assets
available to be used in any given year.   The components of the provision for income taxes consisted of

recognized revenues from product sales to CKJapan of
approximately $4,771,000, $4,292,000, and $5,032,000,
respectively. As of December31, 2005 and 2004, total
accounts receivable outstanding from CK Japan were approximately
$249,000 and $25,000, respectively. As of December31, 2005
and 2004, we had no outstanding accounts payable with CK Japan.   We purchase certain raw material components from a significant
stockholder. During 2005, 2004, and 2003, we purchased
approximately $3,494,000, $766,000, and $1,510,000,
respectively. As of December31, 2005 and 2004, total
accounts payable outstanding to the stockholder were
approximately $63,000 and $48,000, respectively. In addition
during 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recognized revenues from product
sales to this stockholder of approximately $4,500, $150,000 and
$0, respectively. Accounts receivable from this related party as
of December31, 2005 and 2004 were approximately $0 and
$6,000, respectively.   For the year ended December31, 2003, we recognized
revenues from another of our significant stockholders of
approximately $150,000. This stockholder ceased to be a
significant stockholder in 2004.   
10.
Restructuring   During 2001, we implemented a restructuring plan to reorganize
our operations. The restructuring charge of approximately
$3,888,000 included severance costs related to the termination
of eleven employees of approximately $41,000. Also included in
the restructuring charge was an estimated loss of approximately
$3,255,000 for the minimum future rent commitment under our
office facility lease due to the abandonment of a portion of the
leased facility, as well as the write-off of approximately
$592,000 of leasehold improvements related to that portion of
the lease. These amounts are offset by estimated future sublease
income. During 2003, we increased our accrued restructuring
liability by approximately $161,000 to reflect changes in
estimate related to amounts to be received under the lease
payment commitment. Amounts carried on the accompanying balance
sheets represent amounts due under leases for abandoned space,
net of anticipated sublease income.

Commitments
and Contingencies   CommitmentsWe lease certain facilities,
including our corporate headquarters, under non-cancelable
operating lease arrangements expiring through August31,
2007, with a five-year renewal option. We entered into a
sublease through August31, 2007 relating to certain
vacated space, pursuant to which we expect to receive sublease
income that will partially offset the above lease obligations.   Set forth in the table below is information concerning our known
contractual obligations regarding leasing arrangements as of
December31, 2005 that are fixed and determinable in

$947,000 for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.   To control overall quality, we purchase LED components on behalf
of our contract manufacturers. Once these components are sold to
the contract manufacturer, the contract manufacturer is
responsible to us for any loss incurred prior to completion of
the manufacturing process. In connection with our procurement of
raw materials transacted with its outsourced contract
manufacturers, we have the legal right to set off amounts owed
to us from the contract manufacturers against accounts payable
owed to the contract manufacturers for manufacture of finished
goods inventory.   Contingencies   Super
Vision International, Inc.   In March 2002, Super Vision International, Inc., or Super
Vision, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for
the Middle District of Florida seeking a declaratory judgment
that certain of our patents are invalid, that Super
Visions products do not infringe the patents in question,
and that the patents are unenforceable. Super Vision
subsequently amended the complaint to add claims for
interference with prospective business relationships, trade
disparagement and defamation.   
51 Table of Contents   Color
Kinetics Incorporated
Notes to
Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   In June 2002, we filed a lawsuit against Super Vision in the
United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.
In this litigation, we alleged that certain products of Super
Vision, including LED architectural lighting fixtures, pool
lights and spa lights, infringe four of the patents at issue in
Super Visions declaratory judgment action; this complaint
has been amended to assert infringement of a fifth patent. Super
Visions lawsuit in Florida was transferred by the court to
the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts. We moved for summary judgment that our patents
are infringed, are valid and are enforceable, and also moved for
summary judgment dismissing Super Visions claims for
interference with prospective business relationships, trade
disparagement and defamation. On April19, 2005, our motion
for summary judgment regarding Super Visions claims
against us for interference with prospective business
relationships, trade disparagement and defamation was granted.
On August22, 2005, the District Court granted our other
motions for summary judgment, finding that the patents in the
suit are valid and infringed. The District Court also granted
summary judgment rejecting Super Visions claims that we
were guilty of inequitable conduct regarding our actions with
the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have moved for
an award of our attorney fees and, if this motion is granted,
will move for final judgment and an injunction against further
sales of the Super Vision products in the suit and variants of
them.   TIR
Systems, Ltd.   In December 2003, we filed a lawsuit against TIR Systems Ltd, a
Canadian corporation, in the United States District Court for
the District of Massachusetts. In this litigation, we allege
that certain products of TIR infringe three of our patents. Our
complaint was later amended to add a fourth patent. TIR has
filed counterclaims seeking declarations that its products do
not infringe and that the patents are invalid. We believe that
these claims by TIR are without merit. We have recently taken
steps to add four more patents to the suit and to add breach of
contract and theft of trade secret claims to our complaint. The
present scheduling order specifies that fact discovery is to be
completed by September 2006.   In January 2006, we filed a lawsuit against TIR in the Federal
Court of Canada. In this litigation, we allege that several TIR
Destiny products and TIRs LEXEL technology infringe our
Canadian patent. TIR has not yet filed a Statement of Defence in
this case.

Segments   We operate in two distinct segments. These segments are
identified by reference to the manner in which our chief
operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses the
business, which is generally by the type of customer each
segment serves. The first segment is Lighting
Systems, through which we offer LED lighting systems under
the Color Kinetics brand for installation in lighting projects
where their use has typically been specified by a designer or
architect. The second segment is OEM and Licensing,
through which we offer a standard line of LED lighting modules,
custom components and other products that can be incorporated by
manufacturers in products sold under their own brands. Included
also in the OEM and Licensing segment is the licensing of our
technology.   Direct contribution margin includes direct costs normally
associated with costs of revenues and additional direct costs,
such as direct selling expenses, included in other expense
categories contained in the accompanying consolidated statements
of operations. Based on available information, we do not
generate information regarding indirect costs by segment or
assets or cash flows by segment, and hence, such information is
not provided below. The information set forth below is prepared
in accordance with the accounting principles referred to in
Note2, with the exception that direct costs include some
expenses normally allocated to different expense categories in
our consolidated statements of operations. There are no
inter-segment transactions.

Controls
and Procedures   
a
Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures   Our management, including the chief executive officer and the
chief financial officer, carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this
evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective to provide a reasonable level of assurance that
the information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or
submitted by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
requisite time periods.   
b
Managements
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act
Rules13a-15f.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Our
internal control system was designed to provide reasonable
assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the
preparation and fair presentation of published financial
statements.   Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005.
In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework. Based on our assessment we believe that, as of
December31, 2005, our internal control over financial
reporting is effective based on those criteria.   Managements assessment of the effectiveness of its
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005 has been attested to by
Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included
herein.   
c
Changes
in internal control over financial reporting   No changes in our internal control over financial reporting
occurred during the quarter ended December31, 2005 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   
55 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Color Kinetics
Incorporated   Boston, Massachusetts   We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting, included in the Annual Report on
Form10-K,
that Color Kinetics Incorporated and its subsidiaries the
Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Companys management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
companys principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
by the companys board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.   In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2005 is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, based on the criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission.   We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December31, 2005 of the Company and our report, dated
March10, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements.   s DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP   Boston, Massachusetts   March10, 2006
