REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Clarify, Inc.:
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of income, of stockholders' equity and of cash
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Clarify, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1997 and 1998, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows in each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY
Clarify, Inc. the Company, a Delaware corporation, was founded in
August 1990 to develop, market and support adaptable client/server application
software designed to address the external and internal service, support, and
product quality needs of today global enterprises. The Company markets its
software and services primarily through its direct sales organization.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. The functional currency for the majority of
the Company foreign operations is the applicable local currency. The
translation from the applicable foreign currency to U.S. dollars is performed
for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance
sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using the weighted average
exchange rate during the period. Adjustments resulting from such translation are
reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains or losses resulting
from foreign currency transactions are included in the results of operations.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Financial Instruments
The Company considers cash and all highly liquid investments purchased with
an original or remaining maturity of less than three months at the date of
purchase to be cash equivalents. Short-term and long-term investments are
classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair market value.
Unrealized holding gains and losses on such investments are reported, net of
related taxes, as a part of accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized
gains and losses on sales of such investments are reported in earnings and
computed using the specific identification cost method.
The amounts reported for cash equivalents, accounts receivables and other
financial instruments are considered to approximate fair values based upon
comparable market information available at the respective balance sheet dates.
The financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk comprise principally cash investments and trade
accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents and investments are, for the most
part, custodied with three major financial institutions. Deposits held with
banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. These
deposits may generally be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal
risk. The Company customer base is dispersed across many different geographic
areas throughout the United States, Europe and Asia and consists principally of
companies in the networking equipment, high-end software, telecommunications and
computer systems industries. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of
its customers and maintains an allowance for potential credit losses.
Collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, is generally not
required.
In the normal course of business, the Company has exposures to foreign
currency fluctuations arising from foreign currency sales and purchases and
intercompany transactions, among other things. The Company
34
36
CLARIFY INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
uses foreign exchange forward contracts to limit its exposure to foreign
exchange losses arising from foreign currency payables and receivables. The
Company evaluates its net exposure therefrom and enters into forward contracts
to hedge the net exposure over a specified amount. These contracts are executed
with credit-worthy financial institutions and are denominated in currencies of
major industrial nations. Gains and losses on these contracts serve as hedges in
that they offset fluctuations that would otherwise impact the Company
financial results. Costs associated with entering into such contracts are
generally amortized over the life of the instruments and are not material to the
Company financial results.
At December 31, 1998, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts
outstanding to hedge foreign currency intercompany accounts receivable and
accounts payable. These contracts typically have 30 day maturities and are
intended to reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. The total
aggregate fair value of and the net unrealized loss on foreign exchange
contracts were $103 million and $02 million, respectively.
Revenue Recognition
The Company revenue is derived from primarily two sources, across many
industries: i product license revenue, derived primarily from product sales to
customers, including large scale enterprises; and ii service and support
revenue, derived primarily from providing software updates, support, training
and consulting services to customers.
The Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Position SOP 97-2
Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP 98-4 Deferral of the
Effective Date of Certain Provisions of SOP 97-2, effective January 1, 1998.
SOP 97-2 supersedes SOP 91-1 Software Revenue Recognition, and delineates the
accounting for software product and maintenance revenue. Under SOP 97-2, the
Company recognizes product revenue upon shipment if a signed contract exists,
the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of resulting receivables is
probable. In 1997 and 1996, the Company revenue recognition policy was the
same as set forth above.
For contracts with multiple obligations e.g. deliverable and undeliverable
products, maintenance and other services, the Company allocates revenue to each
component of the contract based on objective evidence of its fair value, which
is specific to the Company, or for products not being sold separately, the price
established by management. The Company recognizes revenue allocated to
undelivered products when the criteria for product revenue set forth above are
met. The Company recognizes revenue allocated to maintenance fees for ongoing
customer support and product updates ratably over the period of the maintenance
contract. Payments for maintenance fees are generally made in advance and are
non-refundable. For revenue allocated to training and consulting services, the
Company recognizes revenue as the related services are performed.
Comprehensive Income
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
130 Reporting Comprehensive Income, the Company has elected to display the
total nonowner changes in equity as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets and in the Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders' Equity. Comprehensive income is the change in equity of a business
enterprise
35

CLARIFY INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
resulting from transactions from nonowner sources. The components of accumulated
other comprehensive income for the two years ended December 31, 1998 are as
follows in thousands:
1997  1998
Unrealized net holding gain on investments. $22   $ 10
Cumulative translation   6   612
Accumulated other comprehensive income. $28   $602
Earnings per share
The Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with the
requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128,
Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the period increased by the effect of dilutive stock options and stock
purchase contracts, using the treasury stock method.
The following table presents information necessary to calculate basic and
diluted earnings per common and common equivalent share:
1996    1997    1998
IN THOUSANDS
Weighted average shares outstanding -- Basic.  20,143   20,909   21,683
Dilutive common stock   1,625   1,255    909
Weighted average shares and equivalents -- Diluted.  21,768   22,164   22,592
Net income for basic and diluted earnings per share
$ 8,190  $ 3,930  $ 7,318
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets
generally three to five years. Assets under capital leases and leasehold
improvements are amortized over the lesser of their useful lives or the term of
the lease. Upon disposal, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are
removed from the Company accounts, and the resulting gains or losses are
reflected in the statement of income.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences
between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
differences are expected to reverse. The Company is required to adjust its
deferred tax liabilities in the period when tax rates or the provisions of the
income tax laws change. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
Product Development and Engineering Expenditures
Costs related to research, design and development of products are charged
to product development and engineering expenses as incurred. Software
development costs are capitalized beginning when a product technological
feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for
general release to customers. Generally, the Company products are released
soon after technological feasibility has been established. As a result, costs
subsequent to achieving technological feasibility have not been significant and
all software development cost have therefore been expensed.

Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $258,000, $690,000,
and $972,000 during the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998,
respectively.
Stock Split
On September 18, 1996, the Company Board of Directors authorized a
two-for-one stock split payable in the form of a dividend of one additional
share of the Company Common Stock for each share owned by stockholders of
record on September 30, 1996. All share and per share information in the
accompanying financial statements has been restated to give retroactive
recognition to the stock split for all periods presented.
Stock-Based Compensation
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123 Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, encourages but does not require companies to
record compensation cost for stock-based compensation plans at fair value. The
Company has chosen to continue to account for employee stock options using the
intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees. Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options is
measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the Company
stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire
the stock.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. It requires that an
entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the
statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value.
Management has not yet evaluated the effects of this change on its operations.
SFAS No. 133 will be effective for the Company fiscal year 2000. Management

7. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Stockholder Rights Plan
In June 1997, the Company Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights
Plan the Rights Plan in which preferred stock purchase rights were
distributed as a dividend at the rate of one Right for each share of Common
Stock held as of the close of business on June 30, 1997. The Company adopted the
plan to guard against partial tender offers and other abusive tactics that might
be used in an attempt to gain control of the Company without paying all
stockholders a fair price for their shares. The Rights Plan, which expires on
June 13, 2007, will not prevent takeovers, but it is designed to deter coercive
takeover tactics and to encourage anyone attempting to acquire the Company to
first negotiate with the Board.
Each Right will entitle each stockholder to buy one-one thousandth of a
newly issued share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the
Company at an exercise price of $9500. The Rights will be exercisable only if a
person or group, other than an exempted person, makes a tender offer for, or
acquires beneficial ownership, of 15% or more of the Company then outstanding
Common Stock.
If any person other than an exempted person becomes the beneficial owner of
15% or more of the Company outstanding Common Stock, then each Right not owned
by such person or certain related parties will entitle its holder to purchase,
at the Right then current exercise price, shares of the Company Common Stock
or, in certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the
Company having a market value equal to twice the then current exercise price.
In addition, if, after a person becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of
the Company outstanding Common Stock, the Company is acquired in a merger or
other business combination transaction, or sells 50% or more of its assets or
earning power to another person, each Right will entitle its holder to purchase,
at the Right then current exercise price, shares of Common Stock of such other
person having a market value equal to twice the then current exercise price.
The Company Board of Directors will generally be entitled to redeem the
Rights at $01 per Right at any time prior to a person or group acquiring 15% or
more of the Company Common Stock.
Employee Stock-Based Compensation Plans
1995 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan
At December 31, 1998, approximately 5,315,300 shares of common stock were
authorized for issuance under the Company 1995 Stock Option/Stock Issuance
Plan the 1995 Plan, which serves as the
39

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
successor equity incentive program to the Company 1991 Stock Option/Stock
Issuance Plan the 1991 Plan. The 1995 Plan will terminate on September 13,
2005, unless sooner terminated by the Board of Directors.
The 1995 Plan is divided into three separate components: i the
Discretionary Option Grant Program under which eligible individuals may, at the
discretion of the Plan Administrator, be granted incentive or non-statutory
stock options to purchase shares of Common Stock at an exercise price not less
than 100% or 85%, respectively, of their fair market value on the grant date;
ii the Stock Issuance Program under which individuals may, at the Plan
Administrator discretion, be issued shares of Common Stock directly either by
the purchase of such shares at a price not less than 85% of their fair market
value at the time of issuance or in consideration of the past performance of
services; and iii the Automatic Option Grant program under which non-statutory
stock option grants will be automatically made at periodic intervals to eligible
non-employee Board members to purchase shares of Common Stock at an exercise
price equal to 100% of their fair market value on the grant date. Options are
exercisable at times and in increments as specified by the Plan Administrator
and generally expire ten years after grant.
On May 9, 1997, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
approved the repricing of certain outstanding stock options under the Company
1995 Plan with exercise prices in excess of the fair market value on May 9,
1997. Each employee or officer who elected prior to May 9, 1997 to participate
in the repricing program received a new option with an exercise price of $1350
per share the fair market value on May 9, 1997. Each repriced option retained
its original vesting schedule except that no portion of the option could be
exercised prior to December 9, 1997 and no vesting accrued between May 9, 1997
and December 9, 1997. Certain options granted within 12 months of May 9, 1997
were subject to a longer vesting schedule. Approximately 1,008,000 shares
subject to stock options were repriced pursuant to this program.
1999 Non-Employee Directors' Option Plan
In October 1998, the Board of Directors approved the new Non-Employee
Directors' Option Plan subject to stockholder approval to include an initial
pool of 300,000 shares available for issuance under the plan. This plan will
replace the automatic grant program of the 1995 Stock Option/Stock Issuance
Plan. Options are exercisable at times and in increments as specified by the
Plan Administrator and generally expire 10 years after grant date. The new plan
has a term of 10 years.
There were no repricings of outstanding stock options during the year ended
December 31, 1998.
The share reserve for the 1995 Plan automatically increases on the first
trading day in each of the 1996 1,048,200 shares reserved, 1997 1,158,600
shares reserved, 1998 1,226,200 shares reserved, and 1999 1,351,400 shares
reserved calendar years by the number of shares equal to five percent of the
total number of shares of the Company common and common stock equivalents
outstanding on December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
At December 31, 1998, the Company had a total of approximately 642,000
shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under its Employee Stock
Purchase Plan the ESPP. The purpose of the ESPP is to provide eligible
employees of the Company with a means of acquiring common stock of the Company
through payroll deductions. The plan consists of four six-month purchase periods
in each two year offering period. Employees purchase stock at 85% of the market
value at either the beginning of the offering period or at the end of the
purchase period, whichever price is lower. No participant may purchase more than
$25,000 worth of common stock in any calendar year. Employees may end their
participation in the offering at any time during the offering period, and
participation ends automatically on termination of employment with the Company.
During 1996, 1997 and 1998, approximately 289,000, 463,000 and 477,000 shares,
respectively, were sold through the ESPP.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. If compensation cost for the 1995 Plan and the ESPP had been
determined based on the fair value on the grant dates for all awards since
January 1, 1995 consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company
net income loss and diluted net income loss per share would have been
reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands except per share
data:
1996   1997   1998
Pro forma net income loss. $6,398  $ 849  $ 434
Pro forma basic net income loss per share. $ 032  $004  $002
Pro forma diluted net income loss per share. $ 029  $004  $002
Pro forma net income loss reflects only options granted since January 1,
1995. Therefore, the full impact of calculating compensation cost under SFAS 123
is not reflected in the pro forma amounts presented above because compensation
cost is reflected over the options' vesting period of generally four or five
years and compensation cost for options granted prior to January 1, 1995 is not
considered.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes options-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used:
1996  1997  1998
Risk free interest  600%  574%  515%

The Company has not recorded a valuation allowance for those deferred tax
assets that management believes are more likely than not to be realized through
taxable income in the carryback period or through future taxable income.
However, at December 31, 1998, a valuation allowance of approximately $963,000
has been recorded because of the uncertainty regarding realization of certain
foreign tax net operating losses as a result of the limited profitable operating
history in certain foreign tax jurisdictions.
At December 31, 1998, the Company had a foreign loss carryforwards of
$6,069,000 and state tax credit carryforwards totalling $923,000. The

11. SUBSEQUENT EVENT
On March 12, 1999, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the
current ESPP. The Company anticipates that the shares available for future

The Board approved the following amendment to include one final six-month
offering period commencing May 1, 1999 and ending October 31, 1999. All other
terms for participation by employees will remain the same. The current plan will
terminate after this final purchase period. Additionally, the Board approved the
new 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan subject to stockholder approval to
include an initial pool of 1,000,000 shares available for purchase under the
Plan plus an annual increase to the shares reserved under the Plan on the first
day of each fiscal year in 2000,2001,2002, 2003 and 2004 equal to the lesser of
i 500,000, ii 5% of the Company Common Stock outstanding on the last day
of the preceding fiscal year, or iii a lesser number of shares as determined
by the Board, for stock purchases. The new Plan has a term of 20 years.
