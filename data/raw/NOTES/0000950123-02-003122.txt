REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Viewpoint Corporation
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Viewpoint Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2001 and
2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in
our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

VIEWPOINT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.    BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION
Viewpoint Corporation is a leading provider of interactive media
technologies and services. Its graphics operating system platform, the Viewpoint
Media Player, has been licensed by Fortune 500 companies and others for use in
online, offline and embedded applications serving a wide variety of needs,
including: business process visualizations, marketing campaigns, rich
advertising and product presentations. The Company also provides cross media
digital solutions for film, broadcast television and games.
Until December 1999, the Company was primarily engaged in the
development, marketing, and sales of prepackaged software graphics products. Its
principal products were computer graphics painting tools and photo imaging
software products. With its acquisition of Real Time Geometry Corporation in
December 1996, however, the Company became involved, on a limited basis, in the
development of technologies designed to make practical the efficient display and
deployment of rich media on the Internet.
In June 1999, the Company increased its commitment to the development
of rich media Internet technologies and formed Metastream to operate a business
exploiting these technologies. The Company originally held an 80% equity
interest in Metastream with Computer Associates holding the remaining 20% equity
interest.
In December 1999, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a plan
to focus exclusively on the Internet technologies of Metastream and to
correspondingly divest the Company of all its prepackaged software business. By
April 2000, the Company had sold substantially all of its prepackaged software
product lines.
In September 2000, the Company acquired Viewpoint Digital, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Computer Associates. Viewpoint Digital publishes the
world largest library of 3D digital content and provides creative 3D services
to thousands of customers in entertainment, advertising, visual simulation,
computer-based training and corporate communications.
The Company primary initiatives include     -    Licensing technology for specific marketing and e-commerce
visualization solutions     -    Providing a full range of fee-based digital asset content
creation and engineering professional services for
implementing visualization solutions for marketing and
creating new and enhancing existing enterprise software
applications     -    Proliferating the Viewpoint format into digital advertisements
on various digital media, primarily the Web and digital
set-top cable boxes     -    Forging technological alliances with leading interactive
agencies and Web content providers; and
-    Maximizing market penetration and name recognition, including
distribution of the Company client-side software graphics
operating system, the Viewpoint Media Player
Viewpoint believes that its success will depend largely on its ability
to proliferate its digital technologies into various media, including broadcast
television, games, movies, print, closed intranets, new and existing enterprise
applications and television set-top boxes. Accordingly, Viewpoint has and
intends to continue to invest in research and development and sales and
marketing. Revenues from continuing operations primarily have been from the sale
of technology licenses and fee based professional services, including digital
content creation service and engineering services to enhance and create new
enterprise software applications.
In light of its relatively recent change in strategic focus from
selling prepackaged software, Viewpoint has a limited operating history upon
which an evaluation of the Company and its prospects can be based. Viewpoint
prospects must be considered in light of the risks and difficulties frequently
encountered by early stage technology companies. There can be no assurance that
Viewpoint will achieve or sustain profitability. Viewpoint has had significant
quarterly and annual operating losses since its inception, and as of December
31, 2001, had an accumulated deficit of $198,184,000.
The Company believes that its current cash and marketable securities
balances and cash provided by future operations, if any, are sufficient to meet
its operating cash flow needs and anticipated capital expenditure requirements
through at least the next twelve                    39
VIEWPOINT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED months. In addition, the Company may pursue additional debt or equity financing
to augment their working capital position; however, there can be no assurance
that the Company can obtain financing at terms acceptable to the Company.
2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Viewpoint
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years
consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2001 presentation.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex. We
follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue; however,
certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy.
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SOP 97-2, Software
Revenue Recognition, as amended, and SAB No. 101 Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements.
Viewpoint generates revenues through two sources: a software license
revenues and b service revenues. License revenues are generated from licensing
the rights to use our products directly to end-users and indirectly through
VAR. Service revenues are generated from fee based professional services,
sales of customer support services maintenance contracts, and training
services performed for customers that license our products.
License revenue includes sales of perpetual and term based licenses for
broadcasting Viewpoint 3D content, and limited licenses for its digital content
library. License revenue is recognized over the term of the license in a
term-based broadcast license model and up-front in a perpetual broadcast license
model, providing that no significant vendor obligations remain and the resulting
receivable is deemed collectible by management.
Fee-based professional services are performed on a time-and-material
basis or on a fixed-fee basis, under separate service arrangements. Revenues
related to these services are recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis in
accordance with the provisions of SOP 81-1 Accounting For Performance of
Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts.
Percentage-of-completion for service contracts is measured principally by the
percentage of costs incurred and accrued to date for each contract to the
estimated total cost for each contract at completion. Revenues from customer
support services are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Revenues
from training services are recognized as services are performed.
Standard terms for license agreements call for payment within 90 days.
Probability of collection is based upon the assessment of the customer
financial condition through the review of their current financial statements or
credit reports. For follow-on sales to existing customers, prior payment history
is also used to evaluate probability of collection. Our agreements with
customers do not contain product return rights.
Fees from licenses sold together with fee-based professional services
are generally recognized upon delivery of the software, provided that the
payment of the license fees are not dependent upon the performance of the
services, and the services are not essential to the functionality of the
licensed software. If the services are essential to the functionality of the
software, or payment of the license fees are dependent upon the performance of
the services, both the software license and service fees are recognized under
the percentage of completion method of contract accounting.
If the fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is recognized as
payments become due from the customer. If a nonstandard acceptance period is
required, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the
expiration of the acceptance period.
The Company periodically enters into nonmonetary arrangements whereby
the Company licenses or services are exchanged for services of its customer.
Nonmonetary revenue is recognized at the estimated fair value of the services
received. Generally                    40
VIEWPOINT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
nonmonetary revenues equal nonmonetary expenses; however, due to timing,
nonmonetary accounts receivable and accounts payable may result.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
In accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed, the Company provides for
capitalization of certain software development costs once technological
feasibility is established. The costs capitalized are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated product life, or on the ratio of current
revenue to total projected product revenues, whichever is greater. To date, the
establishment of technological feasibility of the Company products and general
release have substantially coincided. As a result, the Company has not
capitalized any internal software development costs since costs qualifying for
such capitalization have not been significant.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPED FOR INTERNAL USE
In accordance with SOP No. 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, the Company capitalizes costs
of software, consulting services, hardware and payroll-related costs incurred to
purchase or develop internal-use software, when technological feasibility has
been established, it is probable that the project will be completed and the
software will be used as intended. The Company expenses costs incurred during
preliminary project assessment, research and development, re-engineering,
training and application maintenance.
In March 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF of the FASB
reached a consensus on EITF Issue 00-02, Accounting for Web Site Development
Costs. This consensus provides guidance on what types of costs incurred to
develop Web sites should be capitalized or expensed. The Company adopted this
consensus on July 1, 2000. The Company policy for accounting for costs
incurred to operate the Company Web site was not impacted by the adoption of
the pronouncement.
INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method as
required by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under SFAS No. 109,
deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax
rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for stock option grants in accordance with APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and complies with the
disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation. Under APB Opinion No. 25, compensation expense is recognized over
the vesting period based on the difference, if any, at the date of grant between
the fair value of the Company stock and the exercise price. The Company
accounts for stock issued to non-employees in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and
EITF Issue No. 96-18 Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other
Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or
Services.
In March 2000, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation FIN No. 44,
Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, which is an
interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25. This interpretation clarifies     -    The definition of employee for purposes of applying APB
Opinion No. 25, which deals with stock compensation issues     -    The criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non
compensatory plan     -    The accounting consequence of various modifications to the
terms of a previously fixed stock option or award; and
-    The accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in
a business combination.
The adoption of FIN No. 44 did not have a material impact on the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.                    41
VIEWPOINT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less at date of acquisition to be cash
equivalents. Included in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2001, is
restricted cash amounting to $291,000, which was pledged as collateral to secure
a letter of credit used for a security deposit on the Company New York
facility.
The Company considers its marketable securities portfolio
available-for-sale as defined in SFAS No. 115 Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. These available-for-sale securities
are accounted for at their fair value, and unrealized gains and losses on these
securities are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. At
December 31, 2001 and 2000, net unrealized gains on available-for-sale
securities were approximately $45,000 and $12,000, respectively.
The Company invests its cash in accordance with a policy that seeks to
maximize returns while ensuring both liquidity and minimal risk of principal
loss. The policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by
institutions with investment grade credit ratings, and places restrictions on
maturities and concentration by type and issuer. The majority of the Company
portfolio is composed of fixed income securities that are subject to the risk of
market interest rate fluctuations, and all of the Company marketable
securities are subject to risks associated with the ability of the issuers to
perform their obligations under the instruments.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Assets are depreciated on
the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3
to 5 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of
the lease or the life of the asset. Upon sale, any gain or loss is included in
the consolidated statements of operations. Maintenance and minor replacements
are expensed as incurred.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
In accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, the Company
periodically reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets, primarily
consisting of property and equipment, with estimated useful lives that range
from 3 to 5 years, and goodwill and other intangible assets, with estimated
useful lives that range from 1 to 4 years, to determine whether there are any
indications of impairment losses. Our judgments regarding the existence of
impairment indicators are based on legal factors, market conditions and
operational performance of acquired businesses. Impairment losses, if any, are
recorded when the expected undiscounted future operating cash flows derived from
such assets are less than their carrying value. Beginning in 2002, the
methodology for assessing potential impairments of intangibles will change based
on new accounting rules issued by the FASB. Any resulting impairment loss could
have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of
operations.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The functional currency of each of the Company foreign subsidiaries
is its local currency. Financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are
translated to U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes using current rates of
exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates of exchange for revenues
and expenses. The effects of currency translation adjustments are included as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the statements of
stockholders' equity. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions for
2001, 2000 and 1999 were not significant.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.                    42
VIEWPOINT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
CONCENTRATION OF RISK
The Company is subject to concentration of credit risk and interest
rate risk related to cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Credit
risk is managed by limiting the amount of marketable securities placed with any
one issuer, investing in high-quality marketable securities and securities of
the U.S. government and limiting the average maturity of the overall portfolio.
At December 31, 2001, and periodically from 1999 through 2000, the Company has
maintained balances with various financial institutions in excess of the
federally insured limits.
Carrying amounts of financial instruments held by the Company, which
include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable,
accounts payable, and accrued expenses, approximate fair value.
NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE
Basic net loss per common share is computed using the weighted average
number of shares of common stock and diluted net loss per common share is
computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common
equivalent shares outstanding. Common equivalent shares related to stock options
and warrants are excluded from the computation when their effect is
antidilutive.
COMPREHENSIVE LOSS
In accordance with SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, all
components of comprehensive income loss, including net income loss, are
reported in the financial statements in the period in which they are recognized.
Comprehensive income loss is defined as the change in equity during a period
from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Net
income loss and other comprehensive income loss, are reported net of their
related tax effect, to arrive at comprehensive income loss.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In July 2001 the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations and
SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting, and broadens the criteria for recording
intangible assets separate from goodwill. SFAS No. 142 requires the use of a
nonamortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain
intangibles. Under a nonamortization approach, goodwill and certain intangibles
will not be amortized into results of operations, but instead would be reviewed
for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the
periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more
than its fair value. The provisions of each statement, which apply to goodwill
and intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, will be adopted by the
Company on January 1, 2002. The Company will reclassify an assembled workforce
intangible asset with an unamortized balance of $1,767,000 into goodwill at the
date of adoption. This will result in approximately $33,042,000 of goodwill and
$2,361,000 of other intangible assets commencing on January 1, 2002. The Company
will test goodwill for impairment using the two-step approach prescribed in SFAS
No. 142. The first step is a screen for potential impairment, while the second
step measures the amount of the impairment, if any. The Company anticipates it
will complete its initial impairment test for the remaining goodwill balance as
of January 1, 2002 in the first half of 2002. Any impairment charge resulting
from these transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle in 2002. The Company has not yet
determined what the effect of these tests will be on the earnings and financial
position of the Company.
In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations. The statement requires entities to record the fair
value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which
it is incurred. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June
15, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 is not expected to have a material impact
on the Company financial statements.
In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, that is applicable to financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The FASB
new rules on asset impairment supersede SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,
and portions of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations. This
statement provides a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be
disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to
classify an                    43
VIEWPOINT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
asset as held-for-sale. Classification as held-for-sale is an important
distinction since such assets are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of
fair value and carrying amount. This statement also requires expected future
operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in the periods
in which the losses are incurred, rather than as of the measurement date as
presently required. The provisions of this statement are not expected to have a
material impact on the Company financial statements.
3.    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In December 1999, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a plan
to focus exclusively on its digital marketing technologies and services and to
correspondingly divest itself of its prepackaged graphics software business.
Accordingly, these operations are reflected as discontinued operations for all
periods presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
The loss on disposal of discontinued operations, which totaled
approximately $21,260,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999, consisted of the
estimated future results of operations of the discontinued business through the
estimated date of divestiture, the amounts expected to be realized upon the sale
of the discontinued business, severance and related benefits, and asset
write-downs. During April 2000, the Company completed the sale of a substantial
portion of the Company graphics software product lines. Specifically, Corel
Corporation acquired MetaCreations' Painter, Kai Power Tools, KPT Vector
Effects and Bryce product lines; egi.sys AG acquired the Poser product line; and
fractal.com Corporation acquired the Headline Studio product line for total
consideration of $11,250,000, consisting of cash and promissory notes, plus
future royalties. At December 31, 2000, $4,000,000 was still outstanding and is
classified as a current asset of discontinued operations in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. The Company recorded an adjustment to net loss on
disposal of discontinued operations of $1,496,000 during the year ended December
31, 2000, primarily as a result of better than expected net revenues during the
year from the discontinued business. The Company also recorded an adjustment to
net loss on disposal of discontinued operations of $1,122,000 during the year
ended December 31, 2001, as a result of changes in estimates related to assets
and liabilities of the discontinued business. Changes in estimates will be
accounted for prospectively and included in net income loss from discontinued
operations.

year ended December 31, 2000 related to the difference between the fair market
value of the Company common shares into which AOL could have converted the

consideration paid by AOL.
The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock held by AOL also contained a
put right whereby AOL could have required the Company to purchase the preferred
shares, unless exchanged, at a price equal to the original purchase price paid

In July 2000, Metastream issued 1,500,000 shares of Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock to Adobe for cash consideration totaling

7.    AGREEMENTS WITH COMPUTER ASSOCIATES AND MINORITY INTEREST
Beginning in June 1999, the Company entered into a series of agreements
with Computer Associates. The agreements included a non-exclusive limited-use
perpetual license to use the Company 3D related technologies and a service
agreement whereby the Company would provide a defined number of development
personnel to Computer Associates on an as needed basis. Concurrent with the
license agreement, the Company also granted Computer Associates a 20% equity
interest in Metastream, for certain non-monetary support as consideration. The
Company concluded that the series of transactions with Computer Associates
should be viewed in the aggregate and the monetary consideration allocated to
each component based on their fair values. Since the limited-use license of
related technologies was a unique, one-time transaction, the Company did not
have the requisite evidence of its fair value pursuant to the provisions of SOP
No. 97-2. An independent valuation of the 20% interest in Metastream indicated a
fair value in excess of the monetary consideration ascribed to Computer
Associates limited-use licensing rights; therefore, the Company concluded the
appropriate recognition for the transactions was to allocate the committed
monetary consideration to the equity component. The Company allocated the
consideration received of $7,000,000 between minority interest and change in
interest gain pursuant to the provisions of SAB No. 51. The change in interest
gain has been recorded to paid-in capital in the Company consolidated balance
sheets.                    46
VIEWPOINT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities and earnings
of Metastream are included in the Company consolidated financial statements.
Computer Associates' and another minority shareholder combined 20% interest in
Metastream was recorded as minority interest in the Company consolidated
balance sheets, and the losses allocable to their 20% interest have been
reported as minority interest in the Company consolidated statements of
operations.
In connection with the grant of stock options in Metastream to certain
employees and non-employee directors, the Company recorded total deferred
compensation of approximately $24,206,000 and $16,811,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. This deferred compensation represented
the difference between the fair value of Metastream common stock and the
exercise price of these options at the date of grant. Minority interest in the
Company consolidated balance sheets was credited with its proportionate
interest in stock-based compensation expense that was recognized through
November 30, 2000.
On August 10, 2000, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement the
Exchange Agreement with Computer Associates pursuant to which the Company
issued to Computer Associates 115 shares of the Company common stock in
exchange for each share of common stock of Metastream held by Computer
Associates. On consummation of the share exchange in November 2000, Computer
Associates exchanged its 4,800,000 shares of Metastream common stock for
5,520,000 newly issued shares of Company common stock.
The consideration paid by the Company in connection with the exchange
approximated $57,087,000, consisting of the following     -    The issuance of 5,520,000 shares of Company common stock
valued at $1025 per common share, which was the average
market price of the Company common stock for the two trading
days before and after August 10, 2000, for equity
consideration of $56,580,000; and
-    Transaction costs of $507,000.
The exchange of shares was accounted for as an acquisition of minority
interest under the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the purchase
price was allocated to goodwill, net of the carrying value of Computer
Associates' minority interest. The goodwill recorded is being amortized over
four years.
On completion of the share exchange with Computer Associates and the
preferred stock exchanges with AOL and Adobe, the Company owned 998% of the
outstanding capital stock of Metastream. The other shareholder holding an
interest in Metastream was a former director of the Company who was issued and
subsequently exercised an option to purchase 50,000 shares of Metastream common
stock. This shareholder shares were exchanged for 57,500 newly issued shares
of Company common stock, which was accounted for as an acquisition of minority
interest under the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the purchase
price of $270,000 was allocated to goodwill, net of the carrying value of this
shareholder minority interest. The goodwill recorded is being amortized over
four years.
Amortization expense related to the acquisitions of minority interest
totaled $10,723,000 and $894,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.
Subsequent to the acquisitions of minority interest, the Company merged
with Metastream.
On September 8, 2000, the Company purchased all the outstanding capital
stock of Viewpoint Digital, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Computer Associates.
The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The
purchase price of $19,169,000, excluding contingent consideration of $30,000,000
in notes payable, consisted of 715,000 shares of the Company common stock
valued at $8,938,000, cash consideration of $10,000,000 and $231,000 in direct
acquisitions costs. The contingent consideration consisted of two promissory
notes each in the amount of $15,000,000. Both notes are contingent upon the
achievement of certain levels of future operating results and employee retention
through March 8, 2002.
On April 19, 2001, the Company entered into an agreement with Computer
Associates regarding, among other things, the waiver of transfer restrictions
applicable to shares received by Computer Associates under the Exchange
Agreement to enable Computer Associates to sell 1,000,000 shares of Viewpoint
common stock to a third party in a private transaction. The Company agreed to
register the 1,000,000 shares under the Securities Act of 1933. Under the
agreement entered into on April 19, 2001, Computer Associates agreed to accept
newly-issued shares of Viewpoint common stock having a value of $4,000,000, in
partial repayment of a                    47

repayment of a any additional amounts due under the
promissory note due June 8, 2001, b $100,000 due under the
agreement entered into on April 19, 2001, and c the first
$8,943,000 of the $15,000,000 contingent promissory note due
April 30, 2002, which amount will be determined by the
achievement of certain levels of future operating results and
employee retention.
Pursuant to the April 19, 2001 and May 9, 2001 agreements, the Company
registered 3,400,000 shares of the Company common stock under the Securities
Act of 1933.
The amount due Computer Associates under the promissory note due June
8, 2001, and the agreement dated April 19, 2001, is approximately $4,657,000.
For repayment of the first $4,000,000, the number of common shares to be issued
was calculated on the basis of the average closing price of Viewpoint common
stock over the ten-day trading period ending on and including June 8, 2001. The
number of shares to be issued to Computer Associates is 744,740. For repayment
of the remaining $657,000, the Company has the option of paying cash or issuing
unregistered shares of Viewpoint common stock valued at $400 per share. In
connection with this promissory note, the Company recorded $4,753,000 of
additional goodwill and due to related parties in its consolidated balance sheet
based on the closing price of Viewpoint common stock on June 8, 2001.
The purchase price including the first contingent promissory note due
June 8, 2001, in excess of the value of tangible assets and liabilities assumed
of $2,333,000, has been allocated as follows: $3,253,000 to a covenant not to
compete, $3,180,000 to work force, $1,558,000 to technology, $1,203,000 to
customer list, $963,000 to in-process research and development, $643,000 to
tradename and $10,789,000 to goodwill. Goodwill and other intangibles, excluding
in-process research and development, are amortized over their expected periods
of benefit, which ranges from 15 to 4 years. Amortization expense of $6,730,000
and $1,980,000 was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. In-process research and development was written off during the
month of September 2000. The operating results of Viewpoint Digital have been
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of
acquisition.
The following unaudited pro forma consolidated amounts give affect to
the Viewpoint Digital acquisition and the minority interest acquisitions, as if
they all had taken place on January 1, 1999. In management opinion, the
following unaudited pro forma consolidated information is not necessarily
indicative of the actual results that would have occurred had the acquisitions

acquisition of Computer Associates' minority interest in Metastream. As a result
of continuing poor economic conditions, which resulted in a decrease in
estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the Company recorded a $7,925,000
goodwill impairment charge on the Viewpoint Digital goodwill during the fourth
quarter of 2001. The charge was determined based upon the estimated discounted
cash flows over the remaining useful life of the goodwill using a discount rate
of 15%. The assumptions supporting the cash flows including the discount rate
were determined using the Company best estimates as of the date the impairment
was recorded.

compensation of approximately $26,024,000 and $16,811,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. This deferred compensation represented
the difference between the fair value of Metastream common stock and the
exercise price of these options at the date of grant. Minority interest in the
Company consolidated balance sheets was credited for $12,011,000 and
$6,081,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, which
represented stock-based compensation expense related to Metastream stock
options.
In connection with the grant and cancellation of stock options to
certain employees and non-employee directors subsequent to the merger of the
Company and Metastream, the Company recorded total deferred compensation of
approximately $4,975,000 and $1,818,000 for the years ended December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively. This deferred compensation represented the
difference between the fair market value of Company common stock and the
exercise price of these options at the date of grant and was offset by
reductions for cancellations during each period. Stock based compensation
expense of $6,341,000 and $330,000 was recognized during the years ended

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, together with
net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Significant components of the
Company deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows in thousands                     DECEMBER 31,

Net deferred taxes..  $   --  $                             The valuation allowance for deferred taxes increased by approximately
$18,549,000 and $18,433,000 during 2001 and 2000, respectively, providing a full
valuation allowance against the Company net deferred tax assets. The Company
net deferred tax assets include substantial amounts of net operating loss
carryforwards. Inability to generate taxable income within the carryforward
period would affect the ultimate realizability of such assets. Consequently,
management determined that sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the
realizability of these assets to warrant the establishment of the full valuation
allowance. Management assessment with respect to the amount of deferred tax
assets considered realizable may be revised over the near term based on actual
operating results and revised financial statement projections.
At December 31, 2001, the Company has net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $147,302,000 and $3,247,000, respectively, for
federal income tax purposes, which begin to expire in 2011. The Company
federal net operating loss carryforward relates to the Company acquisitions of
RTG and Specular and the net losses incurred by the Company during the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2000, 1999 and 1998. The Company also has net operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards for state income tax purposes, which begin to
expire in 2011. The Company state net operating loss carryforward primarily
relates to the net losses incurred by the Company during the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000, 1999 and 1998. Additionally, the Company has net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1,225,000 for foreign income tax
purposes, which begin to expire in 2006. The net operating loss carryforwards
may be used to offset any future taxable income, subject to potential
limitations on the Company ability to utilize such loss carryforwards pursuant
to the ownership rule changes of the Internal Revenue Code, Section 382.

Basic net loss per common share is computed using the weighted average
number of shares of common stock and diluted net loss per common share is
computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common
equivalent shares outstanding. Common equivalent shares related to stock options
and warrants totaling 8,601,000, 9,814,000 and 5,355,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 respectively, are excluded from the
