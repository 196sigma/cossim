Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting
To the Shareholders of Burlington
Northern Santa Fe Corporation
and Subsidiaries
The management of
Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation the Company is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
The Companys internal control over financial reporting was designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of the Companys financial statements for external reporting
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America.
Management assessed
the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission in Internal
Control Integrated Framework. Based on
managements assessment, the Company concluded that as of December 31, 2007, the
Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those
criteria.
The effectiveness
of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2007, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Companys independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears on
the following page.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of
Directors of
Burlington Northern Santa Fe
Corporation
In our opinion, the accompanying
consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Burlington Northern
Santa Fe Corporation and its subsidiaries the Company at December 31, 2007 and
2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.Also
in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSO.The Company management is
responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.Our
responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the
Company internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated
audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the financial
statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.Our audit of internal control over
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk.Our audits also included
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.
As discussed in Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2007, the Company
changed the manner in which it accounts for planned major maintenance activities
and the manner in which it accounts for uncertain tax
positions.
A companys internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; ii provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Burlington
Northern Santa Fe Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1. The Company
Burlington
Northern Santa Fe Corporation BNSF is a holding company that conducts no
operating activities and owns no significant assets other than through its
interests in its subsidiaries. BNSFs principal, wholly-owned subsidiary is BNSF
Railway Company BNSF Railway, which operates one of the largest railroad
networks in North America with approximately 32,000 route miles in 28 states and
two Canadian provinces. Through one operating transportation services segment,
BNSF Railway transports a wide range of products and commodities including the
transportation of Consumer Products, Industrial Products, Coal and Agricultural
Products, derived from manufacturing, agricultural and natural resource
industries, which constituted 37 percent, 24 percent, 21 percent and 18 percent,
respectively, of total freight revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007.
These Consolidated Financial Statements include BNSF, BNSF Railway and other
majority-owned subsidiaries, all of which are separate legal entities
collectively, the Company.
2. Significant Accounting
Policies
Principles
of Consolidation
The
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of BNSF, including its
principal subsidiary BNSF Railway. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. The Company evaluates its less than
majority-owned investments for consolidation pursuant to FIN 46R, Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities.
Use of
Estimates
The preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods
presented. These estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed by
management. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Revenue
Recognition
Transportation
revenues are recognized based upon the proportion of service provided as of the
balance sheet date. Revenues from ancillary services are recognized when
performed. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a
specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recorded
as a reduction to revenue on a pro-rata basis based on actual or projected
future customer shipments. When using projected shipments, the Company relies on
historic trends as well as economic and other indicators to estimate the
liability for customer incentives.
Accounts
Receivable, Net
Accounts
receivable, net includes accounts receivable reduced by an allowance for bill
adjustments and uncollectible accounts. The allowance for bill adjustments and
uncollectible accounts is based on historical experience as well as any known
trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account
collectibility.
Cash and
Cash Equivalents
All
short-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less are
considered cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which
approximates market value because of the short maturity of these
instruments.
Materials
and Supplies
Materials and
supplies, which consist mainly of rail, ties and other items for construction
and maintenance of property and equipment, as well as diesel fuel, are valued at
the lower of average cost or market.
44
Table of
Contents
Property
and Equipment, NetProperty and
equipment are depreciated and amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives. The Company uses the group method of depreciation in
which a single depreciation rate is applied to the gross investment in a
particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or salvage
value of individual property units within the same class. Upon normal sale or
retirement of certain depreciable railroad property, cost less net salvage value
is charged to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized. The
disposals of land and non-rail property as well as significant premature
retirements are recorded as gains or losses at the time of their
occurrence.
The Company self-constructs portions of
its track structure and rebuilds certain classes of rolling stock. In addition
to direct labor and material, certain indirect costs are capitalized.
Expenditures that significantly increase asset values or extend useful lives are
capitalized. Repair and maintenance expenditures are charged to operating
expense when the work is performed. Property and equipment are stated at
cost.
The Company incurs certain direct labor,
contract service and other costs associated with the development and
installation of internal-use computer software. Costs for newly developed
software or significant enhancements to existing software are typically
capitalized. Research, preliminary project, operations, maintenance and training
costs are charged to operating expense when the work is
performed.
Long-lived assets are reviewed for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present
and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying
value of the long-lived assets, the carrying value is reduced to the estimated
fair value as measured by the discounted cash flows.
Leasehold improvements that meet
capitalization criteria are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis
over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term.
Cash flows for capitalized leasehold improvements are reported in the investing
activities other, net line of the Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows.
Planned
Major Maintenance Activities
Effective January 1, 2007, the Company
transitioned to the deferral method of accounting for leased locomotive
overhauls, which includes the refurbishment of the engine and related
components. Previously, the Company used the accrue-in-advance method of
accounting for these planned major maintenance activities; however, under FSP
AUG AIR-1, Accounting for
Planned Major Maintenance Activities, issued in September 2006, this method
is no longer allowed. This change was applied retrospectively for all periods
presented. Accordingly, BNSF has eliminated the asset and liability recorded
from the accrue-in-advance methodology and established an asset for overhauls
that have been performed. This asset of $245 million, which is included in property and
equipment, net in the December 31, 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheets, will be
amortized to expense using the straight-line method until the next overhaul is
performed or the end of the lease, whichever comes first, typically between six
and eight years. The effects of these adjustments were as follows in
millions:

resulted in an adjustment
to increase stockholdersequity as of January 1, 2005 by $127 million.
Environmental
Liabilities
Liabilities for environmental cleanup
costs are initially recorded when BNSFs liability for environmental cleanup is
both probable and reasonably estimable. Subsequent adjustments to initial
estimates are recorded as necessary based upon additional information developed
in subsequent periods. Estimates for these liabilities are
undiscounted.
Personal
Injury Claims
Liabilities for personal injury claims
are initially recorded when the expected loss is both probable and reasonably
estimable. Subsequent adjustments to initial estimates are recorded as necessary
based upon additional information developed in subsequent periods. Liabilities
recorded for unasserted personal injury claims, including those related to
asbestos, are based on information currently available. Estimates of liabilities
for personal injury claims are undiscounted.
Income
Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using the tax rates that apply to taxable income in the period in which
the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or paid.
Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more
likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Investment tax credits are accounted for using the flow-through
method.

Uncertain
Tax Positions
In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48,
Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. This interpretation addresses the
determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax
return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, the Company
may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more
likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the
taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax
benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be
measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also provides
guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income
taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The
Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. As a result of the
implementation of FIN 48, the Company recorded an $83million increase in
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which is offset by a reduction of
the deferred tax liability of $70million, resulting in a decrease to the
January 1, 2007, retained earnings balance of $13million for additional
information see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Stock-Based
Compensation
The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R,
Share-Based Payment,
on January 1, 2006. This
statement requires BNSF to recognize the cost of employee services received in
exchange for the Companys equity instruments. Under SFAS No. 123R, BNSF is
required to record compensation expense over an awards vesting period based on
the awards fair value at the date of grant. BNSF has elected to adopt SFAS No.
123R on a modified prospective basis; accordingly, the financial statements for
periods prior to January 1, 2006, do not include compensation cost calculated
under the fair value method. Since the adoption of this new guidance, there have
been no significant changes in the quantity or types of instruments used in
stock-based compensation programs, nor have there been any significant changes
in the terms of existing stock-based compensation arrangements. The Company did,
however, record a favorable cumulative adjustment for estimated forfeitures of
$3million, which, due to its immateriality, was included as a reduction to
compensation expense in the first quarter of 2006. 
Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company
applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and,
therefore, recorded the intrinsic value of stock-based compensation as expense.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share
if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.

The Company estimates liabilities and
expenses for the pension and retiree health and welfare plans. Estimated amounts
are based on historical information, current information and estimates regarding
future events and circumstances. Significant assumptions used in the valuation
of pension and/or retiree health and welfare liabilities include the expected
return on plan assets, discount rate, rate of increase in compensation levels
and the health care cost trend rate.

3. Hedging
Activities
The Company uses derivative financial
instruments to hedge against increases in diesel fuel prices and interest rates
as well as to convert a portion of its fixed-rate long-term debt to
floating-rate debt. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company formally documents
the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, as well as
the risk management objective and strategy for the use of the hedging
instrument. This documentation includes linking the derivatives that are
designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets or liabilities
on the balance sheet, commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company
assesses at the time a derivative contract is entered into, and at least
quarterly thereafter, whether the derivative item is effective in offsetting the
changes in fair value or cash flows. Any change in fair value resulting from
ineffectiveness, as defined by SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, is recognized in current period
earnings. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash
flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss AOCL as a
separate component of stockholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the
period during which the hedge transaction affects earnings. Cash flows related
to fuel and interest rate hedges are classified as operating activities in the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
BNSF monitors its hedging positions and
credit ratings of its counterparties and does not anticipate any losses due to
counterparty nonperformance.
Fuel
Fuel costs represented 26 percent, 24 percent and 19 percent of
total operating expenses during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Due to the
significance of diesel fuel expenses to the operations of BNSF and the
historical volatility of fuel prices, the Company has entered into hedges to
partially mitigate the risk of fluctuations in the price of its diesel fuel
purchases. The fuel hedges include the use of derivatives that are accounted for
as cash flow hedges. The hedging is intended to protect the Companys operating
margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes by entering
into fuel-hedge instruments based on managements evaluation of current and
expected diesel fuel price trends. However, to the extent the Company hedges
portions of its fuel purchases, it may not realize the impact of decreases in
fuel prices. Conversely, to the extent the Company does not hedge portions of
its fuel purchases, it may be adversely affected by increases in fuel prices.
Based on fuel consumption during 2007 and excluding the impact of the hedges,
each one-cent increase in the price of fuel per gallon would result in
approximately $14million of additional fuel
expense on an annual basis. However, BNSF believes any fuel price
increase would be substantially offset by the Companys fuel surcharge
program.
Total Fuel-Hedging
Activities
As of December 31, 2007, BNSFs total
fuel-hedging positions covered approximately 3 percent, 1 percent and less than
1 percent of estimated fuel purchases for 2008, 2009
and 2010, respectively. Hedge positions are closely monitored to ensure that
they will not exceed actual fuel requirements in any period.

BNSF measures the fair value of hedges
based upon data provided by various external counterparties. To value a swap,
the Company uses the forward commodity price for the period
hedged.
New York
Mercantile Exchange NYMEX #2 Heating Oil HO Hedges
As of December 31, 2006, BNSF had
outstanding fuel swap agreements utilizing NYMEX #2 HO. No additional HO hedges
were entered into during 2007. As of December 31, 2007, there were no HO hedge
positions outstanding.
West Texas
Intermediate WTI Crude Oil Hedges
At December 31, 2007, BNSF had
outstanding fuel swap agreements utilizing WTI crude oil. The hedge prices do
not include taxes, transportation costs, certain other fuel handling costs and
any differences which may occur between the prices of WTI and the purchase price
of BNSFs diesel fuel, including refining costs. Over the twelve months ended
December 31, 2007, the sum of all such costs averaged approximately 55 cents per
gallon.
During 2007, the Company entered into
fuel swap agreements utilizing WTI to hedge the equivalent of approximately
15million barrels of fuel with an average swap price of $6412
per barrel. The following
tables provide fuel-hedge data based on the quarter being hedged for all WTI fuel hedges outstanding as

Fair
Value Interest Rate HedgesThe Company enters into interest rate
swaps to convert fixed-rate long-term debt to floating-rate debt. These swaps
are accounted for as fair value hedges under SFAS No. 133. These fair value
hedges qualify for the short-cut method of recognition; therefore, no portion of
these swaps is treated as ineffective. As of each of the years ended December
31, 2007 and 2006, BNSF had
outstanding seven and ten separate swaps,
respectively, with an aggregate notional amount of $450million and
$750million, respectively, in which it pays an average floating rate,
which fluctuates quarterly, based on London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR. The
average floating rate to be paid by BNSF as of December 31, 2007, was 680
percent, and the average fixed rate BNSF is to receive is 668
percent.

Cash
Flow Interest Rate HedgesIn anticipation of a future debt
issuance, the Company entered into seven treasury locks in September, October
and November 2007, having an aggregate notional amount of $175million, and an average locked-in
rate of 441 percent, to fix a portion of the rate for a future 10-year
unsecured debt issuance. The treasury locks are expected to be unwound during
2008, and any gain or loss on the hedges will be amortized to interest expense
over the life of the issued debt. These transactions are accounted for as cash
flow hedges.
In anticipation of a future refinancing
of several leveraged leases, the Company had entered into six treasury locks
having an aggregate notional amount of $147million to fix the interest
rate inherent in the operating lease payments. The treasury locks were
terminated in May 2007 in connection with the refinancing of the leveraged
leases, and the resulting $05million gain on these hedges will be
amortized to equipment rents over the remaining life of the leases. These
transactions are also accounted for as cash flow hedges.
In anticipation of future debt
issuances, the Company had entered into fourteen treasury locks having an
aggregate notional amount of $450million to fix a portion of the rate for
a future 10-year unsecured debt issuance and a future 30-year unsecured debt
issuance. The treasury locks were terminated in April 2007 in connection with
the issuance of $650million 10-year and $650million 30-year
unsecured debt. Upon termination, BNSF received $6million from the
counterparties, which will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the
issued debt. These transactions are also accounted for as cash flow
hedges.

The decrease in other expense, net was
predominantly due to lower accounts receivable sales fees, a decrease in losses
on BNSF Railways participation in a synthetic fuel partnership and an increase
in interest income.
During the fourth quarter of 2004, BNSF
Railway indirectly purchased a 417 percent ownership of a synthetic fuel
partnership through a 50 percent interest in a limited liability company with an
unrelated entity. The synthetic fuel partnership generates Section 29 synthetic
fuel tax credits, which reduce the Companys effective tax rate see Note 5 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2007, 2006
and 2005, BNSF Railway received a tax benefit from its participation in the
partnership of approximately $7 million, $11million and $16million,
respectively, related to the fuel tax credits and the deduction of partnership
operating losses. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded approximately $5
million, $9million and $14million, respectively, of other expense,
net related to the Companys share of the partnerships losses under the equity
method of accounting. The partnership does not qualify for consolidation under
FIN 46R, as BNSF Railway is not the primary beneficiary of the partnership. The
partnerships activities terminated on December 31, 2007; therefore, the Company
will not have any additionalexposure to loss from the synthetic fuel
partnership.

All federal income tax returns of BNSFs
predecessor companies, Burlington Northern Inc. and Santa Fe Pacific
Corporation, are closed through 1994 and the business combination date of
September 22, 1995, respectively. Internal Revenue Service IRS examination of
the years 1995 through 1999 for BNSF is completed, and the un-agreed issues are
pending before IRS Appeals. It is anticipated that a settlement with the IRS for
the years 1995 through 1999 may be reached within the next twelve months.
Examination of the years 2000 through 2002 and 2003 through 2005 for BNSF are
completed and protests of the un-agreed issues are pending before IRS Appeals.
BNSF is currently under examination for year 2006.
BNSF and its subsidiaries have various
state income tax returns in the process of examination, administrative appeal or
litigation. State income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a
period of three to five years after filing of the respective return. The state
impact of any federal changes remains subject to examination by various states
for a period of up to one year after formal notification to the
states.
Due to the capital-intensive nature of
BNSFs business, a significant portion of the audit issues with the IRS and
other taxing authorities relate to whether expenditures are classified as
maintenance or capital and whether certain asset valuations are appropriate. A
provision for taxes resulting from ongoing and future federal and state audits
is based on an estimation of aggregate adjustments that may be required as a
result of the audits. The Company believes that adequate provision has been made
for any adjustment that might be assessed for open years through
2007.

Uncertain
Tax Positions
The Company adopted
the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation
of FIN 48, the Company recorded an $83million increase in the liability
for unrecognized tax benefits, which is offset by a reduction of the deferred
tax liability of $70million, resulting in a decrease to the January 1,
2007, retained earnings balance of $13million. The amount of unrecognized
tax benefits at December 31, 2007 was $125million,
of which $91million would impact the
Companys effective tax rate if recognized. A reconciliation of the beginning

It is expected that
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months;
however, BNSF does not expect the change to have a significant impact on the
results of operations or the financial position of the
Company.
The Company
recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest
expense and penalties in income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of
Income, which is consistent with the recognition of these items in prior
reporting periods. The Company had
recorded a liability of approximately $41 million and $65 million for the
payment of interest and penalties for the years ending December 31, 2007, and
2006, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recognized
a
reduction of approximately $7
million in interest and penalty expense. For the years ended December 31, 2006,
and 2005, the Company recognized approximately $5 million and $9 million in
interest and penalty expense, respectively.
6. Accounts Receivable,
Net
BNSF Railway
transfers a portion of its accounts receivable to Santa Fe Receivables
Corporation SFRC, a special purpose subsidiary. SFRC transfers an undivided
interest in such receivables, with limited exceptions, to a master trust and
causes the trust to issue an undivided interest in the receivables to investors
the A/R sales program. The undivided interests in the master trust may be in
the form of certificates or purchased
interests.
BNSF Railways
total capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the A/R sales
program was $700million at December 31, 2007, which was comprised of two
$175million, 364-day accounts receivable facilities and two $175 million,
3-year accounts receivable facilities. BNSF Railway amended the two 364-day
facilities in November 2007, reducing the
committed amounts to $175 million each and modifying their
maturities to November 2008. The two 3-year facilities were entered into in
November 2007 concurrently with the amendment and extension of the two 364-day
facilities and will mature in November 2010. Outstanding undivided interests
held by investors under the A/R sales program were $300million at December
31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, with $75 million
in each facility. These undivided
interests in receivables are excluded from accounts receivable by BNSF Railway
in connection with the sale of undivided interests under the A/R sales program.
These undivided interests were supported by $1,105million and
$1,030million of receivables transferred by SFRC to the master trust at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. When SFRC transfers these receivables
to the master trust, it retains an undivided interest in the receivables sold,
which is included in accounts receivable in the Companys Consolidated Financial
Statements. The interest that continues to be held by SFRC of $805million
and $730million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, less an
allowance for uncollectible accounts, reflected the total accounts receivable
transferred by SFRC to the master trust less $300 million at both December 31, 2007
and 2006, of
outstanding undivided interests held by investors. Due to a relatively short
collection cycle, the fair value of the undivided interest transferred to
investors in the A/R sales program approximated book value, and there was no
gain or loss from the transaction.
BNSF Railway
retains the collection responsibility with respect to the accounts receivable.
Proceeds from collections reinvested in the A/R sales program were approximately
$168billion 158billion and $136billion in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
No servicing asset or liability has been recorded because the fees BNSF Railway
receives for servicing the receivables approximate the related costs. SFRCs
costs of the sale of receivables are included in other expense, net and were
$19million, $23million and $15million for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These costs fluctuate monthly
with changes in prevailing interest rates and were based on weighted average
interest rates of 56 percent, 53 percent and 33 percent for the years
ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These costs include interest,
discounts associated with transferring the receivables under the A/R sales
program to SFRC, program fees paid to banks, incidental commercial paper issuing
costs and fees for unused commitment availability.
54
Table of
Contents
The amount of accounts receivable
transferred by BNSF Railway to SFRC fluctuates based upon the availability of
receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit
risks, including dilution and delinquencies. In order for there to be an impact
on the amount of receivables BNSF Railway could sell, the combined dilution and
delinquency percentages would have to exceed an established threshold for the
combined dilution and delinquency percentages. BNSF Railway has historically
experienced very low levels of default or dilution and was well below the
established rate at December 31, 2007. Based on the current levels, if dilution
or delinquency percentages were to increase by one percentage point, there would
be no impact to the amount of receivables BNSF Railway could
sell.
Receivables funded under the A/R sales
program may not include amounts over 90 days past due or concentrations over
certain limits with any one customer and certain other receivables. At December
31, 2007 and 2006, $11million and $26million, respectively, of
accounts receivable were greater than 90 days old.
BNSF Railway maintains an allowance for
bill adjustments and uncollectible accounts based upon the expected
collectibility of accounts receivable, including receivables transferred to the
master trust. Credit losses are based on specific identification of
uncollectible accounts and application of historical collection percentages by
aging category. At both December 31, 2007 and 2006, $36million of such allowances
had been recorded, of which $34million had been recorded as a reduction to
accounts receivable, net. The remaining $2million at December
31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, had been recorded in accounts payable and other
current liabilities because they relate to the outstanding undivided interests
held by investors. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 4million and $8million, respectively, of accounts receivable were
written off.
The investors in the master trust have
no recourse to BNSF Railways other assets except for customary warranty and
indemnity claims. Creditors of BNSF Railway have no recourse to the assets of
the master trust or SFRC unless and until all claims of their respective
creditors have been paid. The A/R sales program includes provisions that, if
triggered, allow the investors participating in this program, at their option,
to cancel the program. At December 31, 2007, BNSF Railway was in compliance with
these provisions.

The fair value of BNSFs long-term debt
is primarily based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues, or on
the current rates that would be offered to BNSF for debt of the same remaining
maturities. Capital leases have been excluded from the calculation of fair value
for both 2007 and 2006. The carrying amount of commercial paper and bank debt
approximates fair value, and the average interest rate equals the current rate
because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Notes and
Debentures
2007
In February 2007, the Board of Directors
the Board authorized an additional $14billion of debt securities that
may be issued pursuant to a debt shelf registration statement that has been
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, for a total of
$21billion of debt securities authorized to be
issued.
In April 2007, BNSF issued
$650million of 565 percent debentures and $650million of 615
percent debentures due May 1, 2017 and May 1, 2037, respectively. The net
proceeds from the sale of the debentures are being used for general corporate
purposes including, but not limited to, working capital, capital expenditures,
funding debt which matured in 2007, the repayment of commercial paper and the
repurchase of common stock. The issuance of these debentures reduced the amount
of debt authorized to be issued by the Board through its registration statement
to $800million.
2006
In August 2006, BNSF issued
$300million of 620 percent debentures due August 15, 2036. The net
proceeds from the sale of the debentures are being used for general corporate
purposes including but not limited to working capital, capital expenditures and
the repayment of outstanding commercial paper.
2005
In December 2005, BNSF issued
$500million of 6613 percent junior subordinated notes due December 31,
2055. The junior subordinated notes are callable on or after January 15, 2026,
at par plus accrued and unpaid interest. On January 15, 2026, if the junior
subordinated notes are not called, the interest rate will change to an annual
rate equal to the 3-month LIBOR plus 235 percent, reset quarterly. Interest
payments may be deferred, at the option of the Company, on a cumulative basis
for a period of up to five consecutive years; however, during this time the
Company would not be permitted to declare or pay dividends on its common stock.
In the event that certain financial covenants are not maintained, the Company
would be required to sell common stock, the proceeds of which would be used to
pay any accrued and unpaid interest. At December 31, 2007, the Company was in
compliance with these covenants. Because of this structure, certain rating
agencies provide a considerable degree of equity treatment for purposes of
calculating various ratios and metrics. The majority of the net proceeds of the
debt issuance was used to repurchase common stock, with the remainder used for
general corporate purposes.
Capital Leases
In 2007, BNSF entered into several
capital leases totaling approximately $325 million to finance locomotives and
freight cars. The terms of the leases are between 15 and 20
years.
Financing Obligation
In 2005, the Companycommenced the
construction of an intermodal facility that it intends to sell to a third party
and subsequently lease back. Once construction of the facility is complete and
all improvements have been sold to the third party, BNSF will lease the facility
from the third party for 20 years. Construction is expected to be completed by
early 2009 with an
approximate cost of $160
million. As of December 31, 2007, BNSF has sold
$41 million of completed improvements. This sale leaseback transaction is being
accounted for as a financing obligation due to continuing involvement. The
outflows from the construction of the facility are classified as investing
activities, and the inflows from the associated financing proceedsare
classified as financing activities in the Company Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows.
Revolving
Credit Facility and Commercial Paper
In the fourth quarter, the Company
extended the expiration date of its $12billion long-term bank credit
facility to September 2012. Annual facility fees are currently 008 percent for
the facility. The rate is subject to change based upon changes in BNSFs senior
unsecured debt ratings. Borrowing rates are based upon: i LIBOR plus a spread
determined by BNSFs senior unsecured debt ratings, ii money market rates
offered at the option of the lenders, or iii an alternate base rate. BNSF must
maintain compliance with certain financial covenants under its revolving credit
agreement. At December 31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with these
covenants.
At December 31, 2007, there were no bank
borrowings against the revolving credit agreement.
57
Table of
Contents
BNSF issues commercial paper from time
to time that is supported by the bank revolving credit agreement. Outstanding
commercial paper balances reduce the amount of borrowings available under this
agreement.
The maturity value of commercial paper
as of December 31, 2007, of $391 million reduced the total capacity available
under the revolving credit agreements to $809 million. Commercial paper
outstanding included $129 million issued to a consolidated subsidiary of BNSF
that was eliminated upon consolidation. Consolidated commercial paper
outstanding, which had a maturity value of $262 million, was classified as
long-term debt in the Companys Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

L.P.
Santa Fe Pacific Pipelines, Inc., an
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of BNSF Railway, has a guarantee in connection
with its remaining special limited partnership interest in Santa Fe Pacific
Pipelines Partners, L.P. SFPP, a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners,
L.P., to be paid only upon default by the partnership. All obligations with
respect to the guarantee will cease upon termination of ownership rights, which
would occur upon a put notice issued by BNSF or the exercise of the call rights
by the general partners of SFPP.
Kansas City Terminal Intermodal
Transportation Corporation
BNSF Railway and another major railroad
jointly and severally guarantee $56million of debt of Kansas City
Terminal Intermodal Transportation Corporation, the proceeds of which were used
to finance construction of a double track grade separation bridge in Kansas
City, Missouri, which is operated and used by Kansas City Terminal Railway
Company KCTRC. BNSF Railway has a 25 percent ownership in KCTRC, accounts for
its interest using the equity method of accounting and would be required to fund
a portion of the remaining obligation upon default by the original
debtor.
Westside Intermodal Transportation
Corporation and The Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City,
Kansas
BNSF Railway has outstanding guarantees
of $53million of debt, the proceeds of which were used to finance construction of a
bridge that connects BNSF Railways Argentine Yard in Kansas City, Kansas, with
the KCTRC mainline tracks in Kansas City, Missouri. The bridge is operated by
KCTRC, and payments related to BNSF Railways guarantee of this obligation would
only be called for upon default by the original debtor.

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company,
LP
In the third quarter of 2007, BNSF
Railway entered into an indemnity agreement with Chevron Phillips Chemical
Company, LP Chevron Phillips, granting certain rights of indemnity from BNSF
Railway, in order to facilitate access to a new storage facility. Under certain
circumstances, payment under this obligation may be required in the event
Chevron Phillips were to incur certain liabilities or other incremental costs
resulting from trackage access.
Residual Value Guarantees
RVG
In the normal
course of business, the Company enters into leases in which it guarantees the
residual value of certain leased equipment. Some of these leases have renewal or
purchase options, or both, that the Company may exercise at the end of the lease
term. If the Company elects not to exercise these options, it may be required to
pay the lessor an amount not exceeding the RVG. The amount of any payment is
contingent upon the actual residual value of the leased equipment. Some of these
leases also require the lessor to pay the Company any surplus if the actual
residual value of the leased equipment is over the RVG. These guarantees will
expire between 2008 and
2011.
The maximum future
payments, as disclosed in the Guarantees table above, represent the undiscounted
maximum amount that the Company could be required to pay in the event the
Company did not exercise its renewal option and the fair market value of the
equipment had significantly declined. BNSF does not anticipate such a large
reduction in the fair market value of the leased equipment. As of December 31,
2007, the Company had recorded a $68million asset
and corresponding liability for the fair value of the RVG.
All Other
As of December 31,
2007, BNSF guaranteed $6million of
other debt and leases. BNSF holds a performance bond and has the option to
sub-lease property to recover up to $3million of the $6million of
guarantees. These guarantees expire between 2008 and
2013.
Other than as
discussed above, there is no collateral held by a third party that the Company
could obtain and liquidate to recover any amounts paid under the above
guarantees.
Other than as
discussed above, none of the guarantees are recorded in the Consolidated
Financial Statements of the Company. The Company does not expect performance
under these guarantees to have a material effect on the Company in the
foreseeable future.
Indemnities
In the ordinary
course of business, BNSF enters into agreements with third parties that include
indemnification clauses. In general, these clauses are customary for the types
of agreements in which they are included. At times, these clauses may involve
indemnification for the acts of the Company, its employees and agents,
indemnification for another partys acts, indemnification for future events,
indemnification based upon a certain standard of performance, indemnification
for liabilities arising out of the Companys use of leased equipment or other
property, or other types of indemnification. Due to the uncertainty of whether
events which would trigger the indemnification obligations would ever occur, the
Company does not believe that these indemnity agreements will have a material
adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position or
liquidity. Additionally, the Company believes that, due to lack of historical
payment experience, the fair value of indemnities cannot be estimated with any
amount of certainty and that the fair value of any such amount would be
immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Agreements that contain
unique circumstances, particularly agreements that contain guarantees that
indemnify another partys acts are disclosed separately if appropriate. Unless
separately disclosed above, no fair value liability related to indemnities has
been recorded in the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Commitments
BNSF has

expense for all operating leases, excluding per diem leases, was
$706million, $665million and $565million for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. When rental payments are not
made on a straight-line basis, the Company recognizes rental expense on a
straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals and sublease rentals
were not significant.
Other
Commitments
In the normal
course of business, the Company enters into long-term contractual requirements
for future goods and services needed for the operations of the business. Such
commitments are not in excess of expected requirements and are not reasonably
likely to result in performance penalties or payments that would have a material
adverse effect on the Companys liquidity.
Personal
Injury and Environmental Costs
Personal
Injury
Personal injury
claims, including asbestos claims and employee work-related injuries and
third-party injuries collectively, other personal injury, are a significant
expense for the railroad industry. Personal injury claims by BNSF Railway
employees are subject to the provisions of the Federal Employers Liability Act
FELA rather than state workers compensation laws. FELAs system of requiring
the finding of fault, coupled with unscheduled awards and reliance on the jury
system, contributed to increased expenses in past years. Other proceedings
include claims by non-employees for punitive as well as compensatory damages. A
few proceedings purport to be class actions. The variability present in settling
these claims, including non-employee personal injury and matters in which
punitive damages are alleged, could result in increased expenses in future
years. BNSF has implemented a number of safety programs designed to reduce the
number of personal injuries as well as the associated claims and personal injury
expense.
BNSF records a
liability for personal injury claims when the expected loss is both probable and
reasonably estimable. The liability and ultimate expense projections are
estimated using standard actuarial methodologies. Liabilities recorded for
unasserted personal injury claims are based on information currently available.
Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in projecting future events such as the
number of claims filed each year, developments in judicial and legislative
standards and the average costs to settle projected claims, actual costs may
differ from amounts recorded. Expense accruals and any required adjustments are
classified as materials and other in the Consolidated Statements of
Income.
Asbestos
The Company is
party to a number of personal injury claims by employees and non-employees who
may have been exposed to asbestos. The heaviest exposure for BNSF employees was
due to work conducted in and around the use of steam locomotive engines that
were phased out between the years of 1950 and 1967. However, other types of
exposures, including exposure from locomotive component parts and building
materials, continued after 1967 until they were substantially eliminated at BNSF
by 1985.
60
Table of
Contents
BNSF
assesses its unasserted liability exposure on an annual basis during the third
quarter. BNSF determines its asbestos liability by estimating its exposed
population, the number of claims likely to be filed, the number of claims that
will likely require payment, and the estimated cost per claim. Estimated filing
and dismissal rates and average cost per claim are determined utilizing recent
claim data and trends.
During
the third quarters of 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company analyzed recent filing
and payment trends to ensure the assumptions used by BNSF to estimate its future
asbestos liability were reasonable. In 2007, management recorded a decrease in
expense of $17million due to a statistically significant reduction in
filing rate experience for non-malignant claims. In 2006 and 2005, management
recorded no additional expense. The Company plans to update its study again in
the third quarter of 2008.
Throughout
the year, BNSF monitors actual experience against the number of forecasted
claims and expected claim payments and will record adjustments to the Companys
estimates as necessary.

Of
the obligation at December 31, 2007, $226 million was related to unasserted
claims while $44 million was related to asserted claims. At December 31, 2007
and 2006, $17 million
and
$22million were included in current liabilities, respectively.
The
recorded liability was not discounted. In addition, defense and processing
costs, which are recorded on an as-reported basis, were not included in the
recorded liability. The Company is presently self-insured for asbestos-related
claims.

Based
on BNSFs estimate of the potentially exposed employees and related mortality
assumptions, it is anticipated that unasserted claims will continue to be filed
through the year 2050. The Company recorded an amount for the full estimated
filing period through 2050 because it had a relatively finite exposed population
former and current employees hired prior to 1985, which it was able to
identify and reasonably estimate and about which it had obtained reliable
demographic data including age, hire date and occupation derived from industry
or BNSF specific data that was the basis for the study. BNSF projects that
approximately 55,
70 and 90 percent of the future unasserted asbestos claims will be filed within
the next 10, 15 and 25 years, respectively.
Because
of the uncertainty surrounding the factors used in the study, it is reasonably
possible that future costs to settle asbestos claims may range from
approximately $245million to $295million. However, BNSF believes
that the $270 million recorded at December
31, 2007, is the best estimate of the Companys future obligation for the
settlement of asbestos claims.
The
amounts recorded by BNSF for the asbestos-related liability were based upon
currently known facts. Future events, such as the number of new claims to be
filed each year, the average cost of disposing of claims, as well as the
numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation in the United States,
could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than
projected.
While
the final outcome of asbestos-related matters cannot be predicted with
certainty, considering among other things the meritorious legal defenses
available and liabilities that have been recorded, it is the opinion of BNSF
that none of these items, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse
effect on the Companys financial position or liquidity. However, the occurrence
of a number of these items in the same period could have a material adverse
effect on the results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal
year.

Other Personal
Injury
BNSF
estimates its other personal injury liability claims and expense quarterly based
on the covered population, activity levels and trends in frequency and the costs
of covered injuries. Estimates include unasserted claims except for certain
repetitive stress and other occupational trauma claims that result from
prolonged repeated events or exposure. Such claims are estimated on an
as-reported basis because, while the Company has concluded that a probable loss
has occurred, it cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible loss due to
other contributing causes of such injuries and the fact that continued exposure
is required for the potential injury to manifest itself as a claim. The Company
believes that the low end of the range of reasonably possible loss, as that term
is used in FIN 14, Reasonable
Estimation of the Amount of a Loss,
is immaterial for these repetitive stress and other occupational trauma
claims.
BNSF
monitors quarterly actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to
be received, the forecasted number of claims closing with payment and expected
claims payments. Adjustments to the Companys estimates are recorded quarterly
as necessary or more frequently as new events or revised estimates
develop.

basis, were not included in the recorded liability. The Company is substantially

Because of the uncertainty surrounding
the ultimate outcome of other personal injury claims, it is reasonably possible
that future costs to settle other personal injury claims may range from
approximately $380million to $530million. However, BNSF believes
that the $439 million recorded at December 31, 2007, is the best estimate of the
Companys future obligation for the settlement of other personal injury
claims.
The amounts recorded by BNSF for other
personal injury claims were based upon currently known facts. Future events,
such as the number of new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of

BNSF Insurance
Company
The Company has a consolidated,
wholly-owned subsidiary, Burlington Northern Santa Fe Insurance Company, Ltd.
BNSF IC that provides insurance coverage for certain risks incurred after
April 1, 1998, FELA claims, railroad protective and force account insurance
claims and certain excess general liability coverage incurred after January 1,
2002, and certain other claims which are subject to reinsurance. Beginning in
2004, BNSF IC entered into annual reinsurance pooling agreements with several
other companies. The pooling agreements insure workers compensation, general
liability, auto liability and FELA risk. In accordance with the agreements, BNSF
IC cedes a portion of its FELA exposure to the pool and assumes a proportionate
share of the entire pools risk. Each year BNSF IC reviews the objectives and
performance of the pool to determine its continued participation in the pool. At
December 31, 2007, BNSF IC had invested in third-party commercial paper, time
deposits and money market accounts as well as in commercial paper issued by
BNSF. All of the third-party investments are classified as cash and cash
equivalents on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2007,
there was approximately $300 million related to these third-party investments,
which were classified as cash and cash equivalents on the Companys Consolidated
Balance Sheet, as compared with approximately $350million at December 31,
2006.
Environmental
The Companys operations, as well as
those of its competitors, are subject to extensive federal, state and local
environmental regulation. BNSFs operating procedures include practices to
protect the environment from the risks inherent in railroad operations, which
frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials.
Additionally, many of BNSFs land holdings are and have been used for industrial
or transportation-related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial
companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. As
a result, BNSF is subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions. In
particular, the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980 CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, as well as
similar state laws, generally impose joint and several liability for cleanup and
enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without
regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. BNSF has been notified
that it is a potentially responsible party PRP for study and cleanup costs at
Superfund sites for which investigation and remediation payments are or will be
made or are yet to be determined the Superfund sites and, in many instances,
is one of several PRPs. In addition, BNSF may be considered a PRP under certain
other laws. Accordingly, under CERCLA and other federal and state statutes, BNSF
may be held jointly and severally liable for all environmental costs associated
with a particular site. If there are other PRPs, BNSF generally participates in
the cleanup of these sites through cost-sharing agreements with terms that vary
from site to site. Costs are typically allocated based on such factors as
relative volumetric contribution of material, the amount of time the site was
owned or operated and/or the portion of the total site owned or operated by each
PRP.
Liabilities for environmental cleanup
costs are recorded when BNSFs liability for environmental cleanup is probable
and reasonably estimable. Subsequent adjustments to initial estimates are
recorded as necessary based upon additional information developed in subsequent
periods. Environmental costs include initial site surveys and environmental
studies as well as costs for remediation of sites determined to be
contaminated.
BNSF estimates the ultimate cost of
cleanup efforts at its known environmental sites on an annual basis during the
third quarter. Ultimate cost estimates for environmental sites are based on
historical payment patterns, current estimated percentage to closure ratios and
benchmark patterns developed from data accumulated from industry and public
sources, including the Environmental Protection Agency and other governmental
agencies. These factors incorporate experience gained from cleanup efforts at
other similar sites into the estimates for which remediation and restoration
efforts are still in progress.
During the third quarter of 2007, 2006
and 2005, the Company analyzed recent data and trends to ensure the assumptions
used by BNSF to estimate its future environmental liability were reasonable. As
a result of this study, in the third quarter of 2007, 2006 and 2005, management
recorded additional expense of approximately $20million, $5million
and $12million as of the June 30 measurement date, respectively. The
Company plans to update its study again in the third quarter of
2008.
On a quarterly basis, BNSF monitors
actual experience against the forecasted remediation and related payments made
on existing sites and conducts ongoing environmental contingency analyses, which
consider a combination of factors including independent consulting reports, site
visits, legal reviews and analysis of the likelihood of participation in, and
the ability to pay for, cleanup of other PRPs. Adjustments to the Companys
estimates will continue to be recorded as necessary based on developments in
subsequent periods. Additionally, environmental accruals, which are classified
as materials and other in the Consolidated Statements of Income, include amounts
for newly identified sites or contaminants, third-party claims and legal fees
incurred for defense of third-party claims and recovery
efforts.
63
Table of
Contents
Annual studies do not include i
contaminated sites of which the Company is not aware, ii additional amounts
for third-party claims, which arise out of contaminants allegedly migrating from
BNSF property, due to a limited number of sites, or iii natural resource
damage claims. BNSF continues to estimate third-party claims on a site by site
basis when the liability for such claims is probable and reasonably estimable.
BNSFs recorded liability for third-party claims as of December 31, 2007, is
approximately $21 million.
BNSF is involved in a number of
administrative and judicial proceedings and other mandatory cleanup efforts
for 346 sites, including Superfund sites, at
which it is participating in the study or cleanup, or both, of alleged
environmental contamination.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, $66
million and $58million was included in current liabilities, respectively.
In the first quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a $65million pre-tax
charge, or $011 per share, due to an increase in environmental costs primarily
related to a final resolution with the State of Washington and its Department of
Ecology on clean-up of an existing environmental site at Skykomish and an
adverse reversal of a trial court decision on appeal regarding a site at Arvin,
California.
BNSFs environmental liabilities are not
discounted. BNSF anticipates that the majority of the accrued costs at December
31, 2007, will be paid over the next ten years, and no individual site is
considered to be material.
The following table summarizes the
environmental sites:

Liabilities recorded for environmental
costs represent BNSFs best estimate of its probable future obligation for the
remediation and settlement of these sites and include both asserted and
unasserted claims. Unasserted claims are not a material component of the
liability. Although recorded liabilities include BNSFs best estimate of all
probable costs, without reduction for anticipated recoveries from third parties,
BNSFs total cleanup costs at these sites cannot be predicted with certainty due
to various factors such as the extent of corrective actions that may be
required, evolving environmental laws and regulations, advances in environmental
technology, the extent of other parties participation in cleanup efforts,
developments in ongoing environmental analyses related to sites determined to be
contaminated and developments in environmental surveys and studies of
contaminated sites.
Because of the uncertainty surrounding
these factors, it is reasonably possible that future costs for environmental
liabilities may range from approximately $300million to $525million.
However, BNSF believes that the $380 million recorded at December 31, 2007, is the best estimate of the
Companys future obligation for environmental costs.
While the final outcome of these
environmental matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of
BNSF that none of these items, when finally resolved, will have a material
adverse effect on the Companys financial position or liquidity. However, the
occurrence of a number of these items in the same period could have a material
adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal
year.

Other Claims
and Litigation
In addition to asbestos, other personal
injury and environmental matters discussed above, BNSF and its subsidiaries are
also parties to a number of other legal actions and claims, various governmental
proceedings and private civil suits arising in the ordinary course of business,
including those related to disputes and complaints involving certain
transportation rates and charges including complaints seeking refunds of prior
charges paid for coal transportation and the prescription of future rates for
such movements and claims relating to service under contract provisions or
otherwise. Some of the legal proceedings include claims for punitive as well as
compensatory damages, and a few proceedings purport to be class actions. While
the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty,
considering among other things the meritorious legal defenses available and
liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance, it is the
opinion of BNSF that none of these items, when finally resolved, will have a
material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or liquidity.
However, an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items could
have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular
quarter or fiscal year.

Employee separation liabilities of
$91million were included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2007, and principally represent the
following: i $86million for deferred benefits payable upon separation or
retirement to certain active conductors, trainmen and locomotive engineers; ii
$1million for employee-related
severance costs for the consolidation of clerical functions, material handlers
in mechanical shops and trainmen on reserve boards; and iii $4million
for certain non-union employee severance costs. Employee separation expenses are
recorded in materials and other in the Consolidated Statements of Income. At
December 31, 2007, $14million of the remaining liabilities were included
in current liabilities. 
The deferred benefits payable upon
separation or retirement to certain active conductors, trainmen and locomotive
engineers were primarily incurred in connection with labor agreements reached
prior to the business combination of BNSFs predecessor companies, Burlington
Northern Inc. and Santa Fe Pacific Corporation the Merger. These agreements,
among other things, reduced train crew sizes and allowed for more flexible work
rules. The majority of the remaining costs will be paid between 2008 and 2020.
As of December 31, 2007, the Company had updated its estimate and recorded an
additional liability of $4million related to deferred
benefits see i above
and a liability of $1
million related to non-union severance costs see iii above. The remaining costs for ii above are
expected to be paid out between 2008 and approximately 2011, and the costs for
iii above will be paid over the next several years based on deferral elections
made by the affected employees.
12. Earnings Per
Share
Basic earnings per share is based on the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share
is based on basic earnings per share adjusted for the effect of potential common
shares outstanding that were dilutive during the period, arising from employee
stock awards and incremental shares calculated using the treasury stock
method.
Weighted average stock options totaling
22million, 11million and
01million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share, because the options exercise price
exceeded the average market price of the Companys stock for those
periods.
13. Employment Benefit
Plans
BNSF sponsors a funded, noncontributory
qualified pension plan, the BNSF Retirement Plan, which covers most non-union
employees, and an unfunded non-tax-qualified pension plan, the BNSF Supplemental
Retirement Plan, which covers certain officers and other employees. The benefits
under these pension plans are based on years of credited service and the highest
consecutive sixty months of compensation for the last ten years of salaried
employment with BNSF. BNSFs funding policy is to contribute annually not less
than the regulatory minimum and not more than the maximum amount deductible for
income tax purposes with respect to the funded plan.
65
Table of
Contents
Certain salaried employees of BNSF that
have met age and years of service requirements are eligible for life insurance
coverage and medical benefits, including prescription drug coverage, during
retirement. This postretirement benefit plan, referred to as the retiree health
and welfare plan, is contributory and provides benefits to retirees, their
covered dependents and beneficiaries. Retiree contributions are adjusted
annually. The plan also contains fixed deductibles, coinsurance and
out-of-pocket limitations. The basic life insurance plan is noncontributory and
covers retirees only. Optional life insurance coverage is available for some
retirees; however, the retiree is responsible for the full cost. BNSFs policy
is to fund benefits payable under the medical and life insurance plans as they
come due. Generally, employees beginning salaried employment with BNSF
subsequent to September 22, 1995, are not eligible for medical benefits during
retirement.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 158, Employers
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R, which requires the recognition of the
overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the
Companys balance sheet. This portion of the new guidance was adopted by the
Company on December 31, 2006. Additionally, the pronouncement eliminates the
option for the Company to use a measurement date prior to the Companys fiscal
year-end effective December 31, 2008. SFAS No. 158 provides two approaches to
transition to a fiscal year-end measurement date, both of which are to be
applied prospectively. BNSF has elected to apply the transition option under
which a 15-month measurement was determined as of September 30, 2007 that
covers the period until the fiscal year-end measurement is required on December
31, 2008. As a result, the Company recorded a $7 million decrease to retained
earnings in January 2008.
The following table shows the incremental effect of applying SFAS
No. 158 to both the Companys pension and retiree health and welfare plans on
individual line items in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006

The estimated net actuarial loss and
prior service credit for these defined benefit pension plans that will be
amortized from AOCL into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year is
expected to be $16 million and less than $1 million, respectively. The estimated
net actuarial loss and prior service credit for the retiree health and welfare
benefit plans that will be amortized from AOCL into net periodic benefit cost
over the next fiscal year is expected to be $4 million and $8 million,
respectively. Pre-tax amounts currently recognized in AOCL consist of the

The expected long-term rate of return is
the return the Company anticipates earning, net of plan expenses, over the
period that benefits are paid. It reflects the rate of return on present
investments and on expected contributions. In determining the expected long-term
rate of return, BNSF considered the following: i forward looking capital
market forecasts; ii historical returns for individual asset classes; and
iii the impact of active portfolio management.
The assumptions used in accounting for
the BNSF plans were as follows:

The general investment objective of the
BNSF Retirement Plan is to grow the plan assets in relation to the plan
liabilities while prudently managing the risk of a decrease in the plans assets
relative to those liabilities. To meet this objective, the Companys management
has adopted the above asset allocation ranges. This allows flexibility to
accommodate market changes in the asset classes within defined parameters.
Based on its current assumptions and
funding methodology, the Company is expected to be required to make
contributions of $34million to the BNSF
Retirement Plan in 2008. The Company expects to make benefit payments in 2008 of
approximately $7million and $25million from its non-qualified
defined benefit and retiree health and welfare plans, respectively.
The following table shows expected
benefit payments from its
defined benefit pension
plans and expected claim payments and Medicare Part D subsidy receipts for the

Defined
Contribution Plans
BNSF sponsors qualified 401k plans
that cover substantially all employees and a non-qualified defined contribution
plan that covers certain officers and other employees. BNSF matches 50 percent
of the first six percent of non-union employees contributions and matches 25
percent on the first four percent of a limited number of union employees
contributions, which are subject to certain percentage limits of the employees
earnings, at each pay period. Non-union employees are eligible to receive an
annual discretionary matching contribution of up to 30 percent of the first six
percent of their contributions. Employer contributions for all non-union
employees are subject to a five-year length of service vesting schedule. BNSFs
401k matching expense was $21 million, $28million and $20million
in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Other
Under collective bargaining agreements,
BNSF participates in multi-employer benefit plans that provide certain
post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits for eligible union
employees. Insurance premiums paid attributable to retirees, which are generally
expensed as incurred, were $46 million, $44million and $43million,
in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for other deferred benefits payable to certain conductors, trainmen
and locomotive engineers.
14. Stock-Based
Compensation
On April 15, 1999, BNSF shareholders
approved the Burlington Northern Santa Fe 1999 Stock Incentive Plan and
authorized 20million shares of BNSF common stock to be issued in
connection with stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and
performance stock. On April 18, 2001, April 17, 2002, April 21, 2004 and April
19, 2006, BNSF shareholders approved the amendments to the Burlington Northern
Santa Fe 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, which authorized additional awards of
9million, 6million, 7million and 11million shares,
respectively, of BNSF common stock to be issued in connection with stock
options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock.
Approximately 10million common shares were
available for future grant at December 31, 2007.
Additionally, on April 18, 1996, BNSF
shareholders approved the non-employee directors stock plan and authorized
900,000 shares of BNSF common stock to be issued in connection with this plan.
Approximately 450,000 common shares were available for future
grant at December 31, 2007.
Stock
Options
Under BNSFs stock plans, options may be
granted to directors, officers and salaried employees at the fair market value
of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. Stock option grants
generally vest ratably over three years and expire within ten years after the
date of grant. Shares issued upon exercise of options may be issued from
treasury shares or from authorized but unissued shares.
The fair value of each option award is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The
following assumptions apply to the options granted for the periods
presented:

Expected volatilities are based on
historical volatility of the Companys stock, implied volatilities from traded
options on the Companys stock and other factors. The Company uses historical
experience with exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior to
determine the options expected life. The expected life represents the period of
time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is
based on the U.S. Treasury rate with a maturity date corresponding to the
options expected life.

are granted to senior managers within BNSF primarily as a retention tool and to
encourage ownership in the Company. They generally vest over three years,
although in some cases up to five years, and are contingent on continued
salaried employment.

Table of

Performance-based awards are granted to
senior managers within BNSF to encourage ownership in the Company and to align
managements interest with those of its shareholders. Performance-based awards
generally vest over three years and are contingent on the achievement of certain
predetermined corporate performance goals e.g., return on invested capital
ROIC and continued salaried employment.
Additionally, related to the 2007, 2006
and 2005 performance-based grant, eligible employees may also earn performance
stock that will be granted in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, contingent upon
achievement of higher ROIC goals and continued salaried employment. The Company
has committed to a maximum grant of approximately 279,000, 235,000 and 316,000 shares,
respectively.
Certain employees were eligible to
exchange through the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Incentive Bonus Stock Program
the cash payment of their bonus for grants of restricted stock. In September
2005, the program was amended so that exchanges of cash bonus payments for
awards of restricted stock were no longer permitted after February
2006.
Certain other salaried employees may
participate in the BNSF Discounted Stock Purchase Program and use their bonus to
purchase BNSF common stock at a discount from the market price. These shares
immediately vest but are restricted for a three-year period.
Shares awarded under each of the plans
may not be sold or used as collateral and are generally not transferable by the
holder until the shares awarded become free of restrictions. Compensation cost,
net of tax, recorded under the BNSF Stock Incentive Plans is shown in the

15. Common Stock and Preferred Capital
Stock
Common
Stock
BNSF is authorized to issue
600million shares of common stock, $001 par value. At December 31, 2007,
there were 348million shares of common stock
outstanding. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote per share in
the election of directors and on all matters submitted to a vote of
shareholders. Subject to the rights and preferences of any future issuances of
preferred stock, each share of common stock is entitled to receive dividends as
may be declared by the Board out of funds legally available and to share ratably
in all assets available for distribution to shareholders upon dissolution or
liquidation. No holder of common stock has any preemptive right to subscribe for
any securities of BNSF.
Preferred
Capital Stock
At December 31, 2007, BNSF had
50million shares of Class A Preferred Stock, $001 par value and
25million shares of Preferred Stock, $001 par value available for
issuance. The Board has the authority to issue such stock in one or more series,
to fix the number of shares and to fix the designations and the powers, rights
and qualifications and restrictions of each series. As of December 31, 2007, no
Class A Preferred Stock had been issued.
Share
Repurchase Program
In February 2007, the Board authorized
the extension of the current BNSF share repurchase program, adding
30million shares to the total of 180million shares previously
authorized in equal amounts in July 1997, December 1999, April 2000, September
2000, January 2003 and December 2005. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company
repurchased approximately
15million, 18million and
14million, respectively, of its common stock at average prices of $8396
per share, $7343 per share and $5495 per share, respectively. Total
repurchases through December 31, 2007, were 180million shares at a total
average cost of $3820 per share, leaving 30million shares available for
repurchase out of the 210million shares presently authorized.
Additionally, during 2007, the Company repurchased shares from employees at a
cost of $43million to satisfy tax withholding obligations on the vesting
of restricted stock or the
exercise of stock options.

Table of

In December 2005, the Company entered
into prepaid forward transactions to purchase $600million of the Companys
common stock whereby a net settlement in shares would occur upon settlement of
the transactions. In late February 2006, these transactions were settled, and
approximately 8million shares were delivered. While the transactions had
no impact on the shares outstanding at the end of 2005, outstanding shares used
in the calculation of 2006 earnings per share were reduced by approximately
8million shares when the transactions were settled. The Company accounted
for the transactions in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 00-19,
Accounting for
Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a
Companys Own Stock, which
required that the $600million prepayment be recorded as a reduction in
equity in 2005. When the final settlement was made in 2006, this reduction in
equity was reclassified from prepaid forward repurchase of treasury stock to
treasury stock.
