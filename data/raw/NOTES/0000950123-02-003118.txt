To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Steel Dynamics, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Steel Dynamics,
Inc. as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements
of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Steel Dynamics,
Inc. at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 2001 the Company changed
its method of accounting for derivative financial instruments. S/ Ernst & Young LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
Steel Dynamics, Inc. SDI, together with its subsidiaries the company is a
domestic manufacturer of steel products with operations in the following
businesses.
Steel Operations. The company core business operates a technologically
advanced flat-rolled steel mini-mill with an annual production capacity of 22
million tons of flat-rolled carbon steel products, including hot rolled, cold
rolled and coated products. The company sells these products directly to
end-users and through steel service centers located primarily in the Midwestern
United States. The company began construction of its structural and rail
division in May 2001 and anticipates the commencement of structural steel
production during the second quarter of 2002 and rail production during the
first quarter of 2003. This facility is designed to produce and sell structural
steel beams, pilings, and other steel components directly to end-users and
service centers for the construction, transportation and industrial machinery
markets. This facility is also designed to produce and sell a variety of
standard and premium grade rails for the railroad industry.
Steel Scrap Substitute and Other Operations. The company wholly owned
subsidiary, Iron Dynamics, Inc. IDI, involves the pioneering of a process to
produce direct reduced iron, which is then converted into liquid pig iron.
Liquid pig iron is a high quality steel scrap substitute used in the company
flat-rolled steel mini-mill. During 1999, IDI commenced initial start-up and
produced and sold a minimal amount of liquid pig iron to the company flat roll
division; however, it was determined that IDI would require certain design and
equipment modifications to attain its fully intended operating functionality.
These modifications occurred during the second half of 2000 with completion and
restart occurring in the first quarter of 2001. While IDI believed that many of
the design and equipment deficiencies were corrected with these modifications,
the company halted operations at IDI during July 2001 with no specific date set
for resumption of actual production, as a result of higher than expected
start-up and process refinement costs, lower than expected production
quantities, exceptionally high energy costs and historically low steel scrap
pricing. Since operations were halted in 2001, the costs incurred at IDI are
composed of those expenses required to maintain the facility and further
evaluate the project and its related benefits. The company also has two
consolidated subsidiary operations one that receives revenue from the
fabrication of trusses, girders, steel joist and steel decking for the
non-residential construction industry and one that receives revenue from the
further processing, or slitting, and sale of certain secondary and excess steel
products.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of SDI, together with its subsidiaries after elimination of significant
intercompany accounts and transactions. Minority interest represents the
minority shareholders' proportionate share in the equity or income of the
company consolidated subsidiaries.
Use of Estimates. The financial statements are prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles and, accordingly, include amounts that
are based on management estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and in the notes thereto. Actual results
could differ from these estimates.
Revenue Recognition. The company generally recognizes revenues from sales and
the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales when
the product is shipped. Provision is made for estimated product returns and
customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience.
Freight Costs. The company reflects freight costs associated with shipping its
products to customers as a component of cost of goods sold.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid
investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition.
Restricted cash is held by trustees in debt service funds for the repayment of
principal and interest related to the company municipal bonds and for use in
certain property, plant and equipment purchases related to the company revenue
bonds.                    43

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Inventories. Inventories are stated at lower of cost principally standard cost
which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis or market.
Inventory consisted of the following at December 31 in thousands                                2001    2000
Raw   $ 44,807  $ 39,302

Work in    8,512    7,916
Finished    22,791   17,757
$118,368  $106,745
Property, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost,
which includes capitalized interest on construction-in-progress and is reduced
by proceeds received from state and local government grants and other capital
cost reimbursements. Depreciation is provided utilizing the units-of-production
method for manufacturing plant and equipment and the straight-line method for
non-manufacturing equipment. The estimated useful lives of assets range from 5
to 30 years. Since the company halted operations at IDI in July 2001, the
temporarily idled IDI equipment on the units-of-production depreciation method
is being depreciated as a minimum percentage of the straight-line depreciation
methodology. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. In accordance
with the methodology described in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, the company reviews long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recorded on
long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present
and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are
less than the assets' carrying amounts. The impairment loss is measured by
comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount. During 2001,
events and circumstances indicated that approximately $1250 million of assets
related to Iron Dynamics might be impaired. However, the company estimate of
undiscounted cash flows indicated that such carrying amounts were expected to be
recovered. Nonetheless, it is reasonably possible that the estimate of
undiscounted cash flows may change in the near term resulting in the need to
write-down those assets to fair value.
Concentration of Credit Risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject the
company to significant concentrations of credit risk principally consist of
temporary cash investments and accounts receivable. The company places its
temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions and
limits the amount of credit exposure from any one institution. Generally, the
company does not require collateral or other security to support customer
receivables.
Earnings Per Share. Diluted earnings per share amounts are based upon the
weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding
during the year. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation in
periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect. The difference between the
company basic and diluted earnings per share is solely attributable to stock
options. For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, options to
purchase 1,371,000, 1,631,000 and 767,000 shares, respectively, were excluded
from diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive.
Derivative Financial Instruments. Effective January 1, 2001, the company adopted
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instrument and Hedging Activities, as
amended. SFAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all
derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial
condition and measure those instruments at fair value. Derivatives that are not
designated as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. Changes in
the fair value of derivatives that are designated as hedges, depending on the
nature of the hedge, are recognized as either an offset against the change in
fair value of the hedged balance sheet item through earnings or as other
comprehensive income, until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The
ineffective portion of a derivative change in fair value is immediately
recognized in earnings.
In the normal course of business, the company has limited involvement with
derivative financial instruments in an effort to manage the company exposure
to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. The company employs an
interest rate swap agreement and periodically employs foreign currency exchange
contracts as necessary. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 133, the company designated
and assigned the financial instruments as hedges of specific assets, liabilities
or anticipated transactions. When hedged assets or liabilities are sold or
extinguished or the anticipated transaction being hedged is no longer expected
to occur, the company recognizes the gain or loss on the designated hedged
financial instrument. The company classified its derivative financial
instruments as held or issued for purposes other than trading. The company
results of operations and financial position reflect the impact of adopting SFAS
No. 133 commencing January 1, 2001, as a one-time after-tax cumulative effect of
an accounting change of approximately $25 million as a reduction in other
comprehensive income.                    44

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Reclassifications. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform
to the fiscal 2001 presentation.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which
supersedes SFAS 121 and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB No. 30
Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting the effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business and Extraordinary Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions. SFAS 144 retains the fundamental provisions of SFAS
121 for recognition and measurement of the impairment of long-lived assets to be
held and used, and measurement of long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale.
SFAS 144 broadens the presentation requirements of discontinued operations of
APB No. 30 to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of
business. SFAS 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001. The company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS 144, if any, on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flow.

IDI Settlement. IDI entered into a credit agreement dated as of December 31,
1997, with a syndicate of financial institutions under which the lenders agreed
to provide IDI with a $550 million term loan facility and a $100 million
revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2001, there was an outstanding
principal balance of $520 million under the term loan facility and $70 million
under the revolving facility. As a result of higher than expected start-up and
process refinement costs, lower than expected production quantities,
exceptionally high energy costs and historically low steel scrap pricing, the
company halted operations at IDI during July 2001 with no specific date set for
resumption of actual production. This suspension of operations placed IDI in a
position where it might breach certain future financial covenants as well as
trigger a mandatory principal prepayment under the its revolving credit facility
for failure to meet its borrowing base requirements.
On January 28, 2002, the company entered into an agreement with the IDI lenders
to extinguish the debt under the IDI senior secured credit agreement at the end
of March 2002. This agreement required the company, among other things, to
perform the following -   pay $150 million in cash to the IDI lenders on February 1, 2002 -   issue an aggregate of $220 million of common stock in three installments
to the IDI lenders during March 2002 at market prices; and -   make contingent future payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $220
million to the existing IDI lenders if, and only if, IDI resumes
operations by January 27, 2007 and generates positive cash flow, as
defined in the agreement.
The company compliance with the above requirements by March 29, 2002, will
constitute full and final settlement of all of IDI obligations under the IDI
credit agreement and all of the company obligations under any outstanding
guarantees of IDI credit agreement obligations and will cause the IDI credit
agreement to terminate. The contingent future payments of $220 million are
classified as a non-interest bearing other long-term contingent liability on the
company balance sheet. At December 31, 2001, no contingent payments are
expected to be required within the next twelve months. In connection with the
SDI Refinancing and the IDI settlement, the company will write-off approximately
$19 million, net of tax, of the remaining capitalized financing costs
associated with its retired exiting senior credit facilities.
The company borrowings at December 31, after giving effect to the IDI
settlement, consisted of the following in thousands                                              2001     2000

Electric Utility Development Loan. In June 1994, the company entered into a loan
agreement with Indiana Michigan Power Company for approximately $130 million to
finance the company portion of the cost to construct a substation. The loan
bears interest at 80%, with equal monthly principal and interest payments
required in amounts sufficient to amortize the substation facility loan over a
period of 15 years. The outstanding principal balance on the substation facility
loan was $102 million and $109 million, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.
In addition, the company entered into another loan agreement with Indiana
Michigan Power Company for approximately $78 million to finance the company
portion of the cost to construct a transmission line and certain related
facilities. The loan bears interest at 80%, with equal monthly principal and
interest payments required in amounts sufficient to amortize the transmission
facility loan over a period of 20 years. The outstanding principal balance on
the transmission facility loan was $66 million and $68 million as of December
31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
During 1998, IDI entered into an agreement with American Electric Power
Financial Services to provide a $65 million eight-year loan. This electric
utility loan is secured by on-site power distribution and related equipment. The

The deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the net tax effects of temporary
differences that are derived from the cumulative taxable or deductible amounts
recorded in the consolidated financial statements in years different from that
of the income tax returns. As of December 31, 2001, the company had available
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $576 million for federal
income tax purposes, which expire through 2021. As of December 31, 2001, the
company had available capital loss carryforwards of approximately $55 million
for federal and state income tax purposes, which expire beginning in 2005.
As of December 31, 2001, the company had available foreign tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $30 million for federal income tax purposes,
which expire in 2003. Due to the limited time frame remaining to utilize the
foreign tax credits and the decreased likelihood that the net operating losses
will be fully absorbed prior to the expiration of the credits, a valuation
allowance of $19 million was recorded in 2001. Even if these credits are not
utilized as such, they can be treated as tax-deductible expenses. Therefore 11 million of foreign tax credit remains as a deferred tax asset as of
December 31, 2001.                    48

NOTE 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The company has an off-take agreement with Heidtman Steel Products Heidtman
that extends through March 2007 see Note 8. Under the terms of the agreement,
Heidtman is obligated to purchase and the company is obligated to sell to
Heidtman at least 76,000 tons of hot band products per quarter or 336,000 tons
annually and at least 15,000 tons of cold-rolled products per quarter or 60,000
tons annually. The company pricing to Heidtman is determined by either a
market pricing formula based on an all-in cost plus basis or a spot market
pricing formula determined on the basis of a discounted market index.
The company has executed a raw material supply contract with OmniSource
Corporation OmniSource for the purchase of steel scrap resources see Note 8.
Under the terms of the contract, OmniSource will locate and secure, at the
lowest then-available market price, steel scrap for the company in grades and
quantities sufficient for the company to meet substantially all of its
production requirements. The term of the contract extends to at least December
31, 2002. The company retains the right to acquire scrap from other sources if
certain business conditions are present.
The company purchases its electricity consumed at its wholly-owned Butler
facilities pursuant to a contract, which extends through December 2007. The
contract designates 170 hours as interruptible service during 2002 and these
interruptible hours further decrease annually through expiration of the
agreement. The contract also establishes an agreed fixed rate energy charge per
Mill/kWh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement. The
company has outstanding construction-related commitments of $782 million at
December 31, 2001, related to the structural and rail mill construction.
During 1999, Steel Dynamics, together with a number of investment banks, was

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
During the second and third quarters of 2001, the company settled seven of the
nine pending lawsuits, and in the first quarter of 2002, the company settled an
eighth suit, in each case without any admission of liability and, to the extent
of any monetary payments, except for approximately $23 million, for amounts
provided by our insurance carriers and within applicable insurance coverage. The
remaining lawsuit is a consolidated Minnesota federal court case involving
claims for approximately $48 million in compensatory damages; together with
claims for interest and attorney fees and punitive damages. Discovery has been
substantially completed. The company maintains that it was engaged solely to
provide post-offering technical and operational advice and consultation
services, that it was not an issuer, guarantor, underwriter or seller of any of
the notes, and that it did not draft any of the offering materials. While the
company believes that it has meritorious legal and factual defenses to these
claims, and is vigorously defending itself in the remaining related action, and
while the company believes that it also has meritorious claims against one or
more of the other co-defendants for some or all of the plaintiffs' claims, there
can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome with respect to the remaining
lawsuit or that the company will not be found liable for all of the claimed
damages in that case. The company has expended all of its available insurance
coverage, and any settlement of this case, to the extent of any monetary
payments, or if the case is tried, the amount of any judgment, will not be
covered by insurance and will impact the company earnings.
NOTE 8. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED COMPANIES

The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value,
because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments. The carrying
value of long-term debt, including the current portion, approximates fair value
due the interest being determined by variable rates, repricing periodically. The
fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was estimated to be a liability
of $88 million and $40 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The fair values are estimated by the use of quoted market prices, estimates
obtained from brokers, and other appropriate valuation techniques based on
references available.
NOTE 10. RETIREMENT PLANS
The company sponsors a 401k retirement savings and profit sharing plan for
eligible employees, which is a qualified plan for federal income tax purposes.
The company total expense for the plan was $424,000, $46 million and $36
million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.                    51

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 11. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The company has two reportable segments: steel operations and steel scrap
substitute operations. The steel operations segment includes the company flat
rolled division and structural and rail division. The flat rolled division sells
a broad range of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and coated steel products, including a
large variety of specialty products such as thinner gauge hot-rolled products
and galvanized products. The flat rolled division sells directly to end-users
and service centers located primarily in the Midwestern United States and these
products are used in numerous industry sectors, including the automotive,
construction and commercial industries. The company began significant
construction of its structural and rail division in May 2001 and anticipates the
commencement of structural steel production during the second quarter of 2002
and rail production during the first quarter of 2003. This facility is designed
to produce and sell structural steel beams, pilings, and other steel components
directly to end-users and service centers for the construction, transportation
and industrial machinery markets. This facility is also designed to produce and
sell a variety of standard and premium grade rails for the railroad industry.
Steel scrap substitute operations include the revenues and expenses associated
with the company wholly owned subsidiary, Iron Dynamics. Since 1997, IDI has
attempted to develop and commercialize a pioneering process to produce liquid
pig iron, a substitute for a portion of the solid pig iron and steel scrap used
in the production processes of the company flat rolled division and structural
and rail division. During 1999, IDI commenced initial start-up and produced and
sold a minimal amount of liquid pig iron to the company flat roll division;
however, it was determined that IDI would require certain design and equipment
modifications to attain its fully intended operating functionality. These
modifications occurred during the second half of 2000 with completion and
restart occurring in the first quarter of 2001. However, while IDI believed that
many of the design and equipment deficiencies were corrected with these
modifications, the company halted operations at IDI during July 2001 with no
specific date set for resumption of actual production, as a result of higher
than expected start-up and process refinement costs, lower than expected
production quantities, exceptionally high energy costs and historically low
steel scrap pricing. Since operations were halted in 2001, IDI costs are
composed of those expenses required to maintain the facility and further
evaluate the project and its related benefits.
Revenues included in the category All Other are from two subsidiary
operations that are below the quantitative thresholds required for reportable
segments. These revenues are from the fabrication of trusses, girders, steel
joist and steel decking for the non-residential construction industry; from the
further processing, or slitting, and sale of certain steel products; and from
the resale of certain secondary and excess steel products. In addition, All
Other also includes certain unallocated corporate accounts, such as the
company senior secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes, and certain
other investments.                    52

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The company operations are primarily organized and managed by operating
segment. Operating segment performance and resource allocations are primarily
based on operating results before income taxes. The accounting policies of the
reportable segments are consistent with those described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. Intersegment sales and any related profits are eliminated
in consolidation. The external net sales of the company steel operations
include sales to non-U.S. companies of $80 million, $103 million and $85
million, for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
