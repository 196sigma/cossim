AUDITORS REPORT The Board of Directors and Shareholders Pixelworks, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Pixelworks, Inc. as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, redeemable convertible preferred stock
and shareholders equity deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2001.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Pixelworks Inc. as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature
of Business Pixelworks, Inc. Pixelworks designs and develops complete
system-on-a-chip solutions that enable the visual display of broadband content.
Pixelworks technology interprets and optimizes video, computer graphics, and
visual Web information for display on a wide variety of devices. Basis
of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Pixelworks and its wholly owned subsidiary, Pixelworks Japan, LLC. Significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Accounts
denominated in foreign currencies have been remeasured using the U.S. dollar as
the functional currency. Pixelworks
holds an investment in an unconsolidated entity accounted for by the cost
method. Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an on-going basis, the
Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns bad debts, inventories, investments, prepaid expenses, intangible assets income taxes, warranty obligations and litigation and other contingencies.
Pixelworks bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Pixelworks believes the following critical accounting policies affect
its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its
consolidated financial statements. The Company records estimated reductions to
revenue for customer returns based on historical experience. If actual customer returns increase as a
result of future product introductions the Company may be required to recognize
additional reductions to revenue. The
Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the
financial condition of Pixelworks customers were to deteriorate, resulting in
an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be
required. Pixelworks provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at
the time revenue is recognized. While Pixelworks engages in extensive product
quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating
the quality of its suppliers, Pixelworks estimated warranty liability is
affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs
incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from Pixelworks estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. Pixelworks
writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal
to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value
based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual
market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory write-downs may be required. The Company holds a minority
equity interest in a company having operations or technology in areas within
its strategic focus. The Company may record an investment impairment charge if
it believes the investment has experienced a decline in value that is other
than temporary. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating
results of underlying 39 investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying
value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current
carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future.
Pixelworks records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to
the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Should Pixelworks
determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred
tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be
charged to income in the period such determination was made. Cash
and Cash Equivalents Pixelworks considers all highly liquid investments having an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash
equivalents consist primarily of deposits, money market funds and commercial
paper. Marketable
Securities The Company accounts for its marketable securities in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. SFAS 115, Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The cost of securities sold is based on the
specific identification method. The
investments in marketable securities have been classified as held to maturity
and, accordingly are reported at amortized cost and consist of

40 Inventories Inventories consist of finished goods and work in process and are
stated at the lower of standard cost approximates actual cost on a first-in first-out basis or market net realizable value. Property
and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. The cost of repairs and
maintenance is expensed as incurred.
Depreciation on computer equipment and software, tooling and leasehold
improvements is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, two years for computer equipment and software and the
estimated life of the product for tooling, generally two years. Amortization of
leasehold improvements is recognized over the shorter of the life of the
improvement or the remaining life of the lease. Goodwill
and Intangible Assets The Company amortizes costs in excess of fair value of net assets of
businesses acquired goodwill using the straight-line method over a period
of 5 years. Assembled workforce is
being amortized over 3 years.
Intangible assets consist of intellectual property, primarily technology
license agreements. Intangible assets
are stated at cost and are amortized over the life of the agreement, ranging
from 1 year to 10 years. The Company
reviews the carrying value of intangibles for impairment whenever events and
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is
determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the
operation to which the assets relate, to the carrying amount including
associated intangible assets of the operation. Asset
Impairments As required by SFAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, management reviews
long-lived assets and the related intangible assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets
may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by
comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which
the assets relate, to the carrying amount including associated intangible
assets of the operation. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying
amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down first, followed
by the other long-lived assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value is
determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon
the nature of the assets. Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, defines a fair
value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar instrument.
Under the fair value based method, compensation cost is measured at the grant
date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period which is usually the vesting period. However, SFAS 123 also allows an entity to
continue to measure compensation cost using the intrinsic value based method of
accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25 Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. Under the intrinsic value based method, compensation cost
is the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the stock at grant date or
other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the
stock. Entities electing to remain with the accounting in Opinion 25 must make
pro forma disclosures of net income and, if presented, earnings per share, as
if the fair value based method had been applied. Pixelworks has elected to
continue to apply the prescribed accounting in Opinion 25 and make the required
disclosures under SFAS 123. Pixelworks accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force
consensus on Issue No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to
Other than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or
Services. There have been no equity instruments issued to
non-employees during the periods presented. 41 Revenue
Recognition Pixelworks recognizes revenue for product sales to direct customers and
commissions on third party sales upon shipment of the underlying merchandise.
Revenue from product sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment if the
distributor has a firm sales commitment from an end customer. Pixelworks
complies with the revenue recognition guidance summarized in Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements. A
reserve for sales returns and allowances is recorded at the time of shipment.
As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the reserve for sales returns and allowances
was $673 and $546, respectively. Pixelworks accrues a liability for the estimated future repair and
replacement costs to be incurred under the provisions of Pixelworks warranty
agreements. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the reserve for warranty repairs
was $978 and $527, respectively. The net change in the reserve for warranty
repairs for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was an increase of
approximately $451, $394 and $133 respectively. Research
and Development Research and development are charged to expense as incurred. Income
Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Fair
Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value
due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Comprehensive
Income SFAS130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, establishes standards for the reporting of comprehensive
income and its components, but has no impact on the Companys net earnings or
total shareholders equity. To date such transactions that are required to be reported in comprehensive income are
not material to the Companys financial position or results of operations. Concentration
of Suppliers Pixelworks does not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility
and does not have the resources to manufacture its products internally.
Pixelworks relies on four third party foundries to produce all its products. In
light of these dependencies, it is reasonably possible that failure to perform
by one of these suppliers could have a severe impact on Pixelworks growth and
results of operations. Risk of
Technological Change The markets in which Pixelworks competes or seeks to compete are
subject to rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions changing customer requirements for new products and features, and 42 evolving industry standards. The introduction of new technologies and
the emergence of new industry standards could render Pixelworks products less
desirable or obsolete which could harm its business. Concentration
of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject Pixelworks to a
concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and accounts receivable. Pixelworks limits its exposure to credit
risk associated with cash and cash equivalents by placing its cash and cash
equivalents with various high credit quality financial institutions. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, Pixelworks had accounts receivable
from two distributors representing approximately 53% and 70% of accounts
receivable. Loss or non-performance by these significant customers could
adversely affect Pixelworks financial position or results from operations. Costs
of Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use Internal use software development costs are accounted for in accordance
with Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed
or Obtained for Internal Use. Costs incurred in the preliminary
project stage are expensed as incurred and costs incurred in the application
and development stage, which meet the capitalized criteria, are capitalized and
amortized on a straight-line basis over two years, the estimated useful life of
the asset. Net
loss per share Pixelworks reports net loss per share in accordance with SFAS 128, Earnings per
Share, and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 98 SAB 98, which
requires the presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic
earnings per share EPS is computed on the basis of weighted average number
of common shares outstanding. Diluted
EPS is computed on the basis of weighted average common shares outstanding plus
the effect of outstanding stock options and warrants using the treasury stock
method, shares of convertible preferred stock on an as converted basis, and
shares of restricted stock, if the potential common shares are not
anti-dilutive. The following weighted-average potential common shares have been
excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share for the periods
presented because the effect would have been anti-dilutive

Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS 142 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized
but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. The amortization provisions
of SFAS142 apply to goodwill and intangible assets 43 acquired after June 30, 2001. With respect to goodwill and intangible
assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, the Company is required to adopt FAS 142
effective January 1, 2002. Application of the non-amortization provisions of
SFAS 142 for goodwill is expected to result in a decrease in amortization
expense of approximately $160 million in 2002. At December 31, 2001, Pixelworks had net goodwill and assembled
workforce of approximately $692 million. Pursuant to SFAS 142, Pixelworks will
test its goodwill for impairment upon adoption and, if impairment is indicated record such impairment as a cumulative effect of an accounting change. The
Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption may have on its

3. SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY Series
D offering and beneficial conversion feature On February 22, 2000, Pixelworks issued a total of 2,239,212 shares of
Series D preferred stock at $1275 per share.
The Series D preferred stock was issued with a beneficial conversion
feature totaling $107 million measured as the difference between the estimated
fair value of the underlying common stock and the conversion price of $850 per
share. Initial
Public Offering On May 19, 2000 Pixelworks sold 5,750,000 shares of Common Stock at 1000 per share in an Initial Public Offering IPO. In June 2000 Pixelworks sold a further 862,500 shares of Common Stock under the terms of the
over allotment agreement relating to that Initial Public Offering. Convertible
Preferred Stock Upon the completion of Pixelworks IPO in May 2000, all of the then
outstanding convertible preferred shares were automatically converted into
common shares as indicated below.

45 Warrants In connection with the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock
offering, Pixelworks issued warrants, at a nominal value, for the purchase of
up to an aggregate of 1,853,198 shares of Pixelworks common stock at an
exercise price of $0674 per share. The warrants were exercised in 1999. The fair value of the warrants issued of $71 was determined by applying
the Black-Scholes methodology using the issuance date for Series A redeemable
convertible preferred stock as the measurement date. The per share weighted
average fair market value was $006 on the date of grant, with the following
weighted average assumptions: Risk-free interest rate of 6%, expected dividend
yield of -0 a two-year term and an expected volatility of 100%. Note
Receivable for Common Stock During 1999, 305,937 of stock options were exchanged for 305,937 shares
of common stock subject to vesting in exchange for a note receivable. The note
receivable is due and payable the earlier of 1 August 31, 2008 or 2 upon
termination of the borrowers employment and bears interest at 6% per year payable annually. The note receivable is secured by the shares of common stock
issued thereunder. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, there were 81,410 and
173,116 shares of unvested common stock, respectively. Stock
Option Plans Pixelworks has a 1997 Incentive Stock Option Plan and a 2001
Non-qualified Stock option plan the option plans under which 6,340,116 and
2,000,000 stock options, respectively, may be granted to employees. Options
granted under the plans must generally be exercised while the individual is an
employee and within ten years of the date of grant. On the standard vesting
schedule, each option shall become exercisable at a rate of 25% on the first
anniversary date of the grant and on the last day of every month thereafter for
a total of thirty-six additional increments unless otherwise specifically
stated at the time of grant. On the alternative vesting schedule, options
become exercisable monthly for a period of four years, with 10% becoming
exercisable in the first year, 20% becoming exercisable in the second year, 30 becoming exercisable in the third year, and 40% becoming exercisable in the
fourth year. Had Pixelworks accounted for its stock-based compensation plan in
accordance with SFAS 123, Pixelworks net loss would approximate the pro forma
disclosure as follows

As of December 31, 2001, 2,327,302 shares were available for grant
under the option plans. Pixelworks has recorded deferred stock compensation of $18,510 through
December 31, 2001. This deferred stock compensation is based on the difference
between the fair market value of common stock and the exercise price of the
option or stock on the grant date. Deferred stock compensation is being
amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period, generally four
years, consistent with the method described in FASB Interpretation No. 28.
Pixelworks recognized compensation expense of $8,461, $2,227 and $565 during
the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, related to
these grants. Amortization of the December 31, 2001 balance of deferred stock
compensation for the years ending December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 would approximate 3,771, $1,579 and $308, respectively. Employee
Stock Purchase Plan The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP. Under the ESPP employees may purchase shares
of the Companys common stock at 85% of the fair market value at specific predetermined dates. A total of
1,500,000 shares of common stock has been reserved for issuance under the
ESPP. During the year ended December
31, 2001 and 2000 the Company issued 78,218 and 12,375 shares under the ESPP
for proceeds of approximately $757,000 and $105,000, respectively. 4. INCOME TAXES Components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended

49 During the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 the Company
recognized tax benefits of $2,256, $0, and $0, respectively, related to
differences between financial and tax reporting of stock option transactions
and net operating losses from acquired company. The $2,256 for the year ended December 31, 2001 was credited to
common stock and goodwill, in the amount of $831 and $1,425, respectively. The Company has established a valuation allowance for certain deferred
tax assets, including net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. SFAS No.
109 requires that a valuation allowance be recorded when it is more likely than
not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The net change in the total valuation allowance
for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was an increase of
approximately $2,603, $2,058 and 1,914, respectively. As subsequent tax benefits relating to the valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2001 can be recognized the benefits will
be allocated between common stock and goodwill in the amounts of $3,824 and 3,565, respectively. As of December 31, 2001, Pixelworks has net operating loss and other
credit carryforwards of approximately $5,598 and $2,865, respectively, which
will expire between 2012-2020.
Utilization of net operating losses and credits are subject to certain
limitations when there is a change of more than 50% in ownership of the
Company. Such changes occurred with the sale of preferred stock in 1998.
Accordingly, the net operating loss and credit carryforwards generated from
periods prior to April 28, 1998 are subject to the limitation. 5. ACQUISITIONS On January30, 2001, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
shares of Panstera, Inc. in exchange for approximately 4,500,000 shares of
Pixelworks stock valued as follows

In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded a one-time
charge of $324million for the write-off of in-process research and
development IPRD. The value
assigned to IPRD related to research projects for which technological
feasibility had not been established.
The value was determined by 50 estimating the net cash flows from the sale of products from 2001
through 2005 resulting from the completion of such projects, and discounting
the net cash flows back to their present value using a risk adjusted rate of
35%. The estimated net cash flows from these products were based on
managements estimates of related revenues, cost of goods sold, RD costs selling, general and administrative costs and income taxes. The Company then estimated the stage of
completion of the products at the date of the acquisition based on RD
costs that had been expended as of the date of acquisition as compared to total
RD costs at completion. The percentages derived from this calculation were
then applied to the net present value of future cash flows to determine the
in-process charge. The nature of the efforts to develop the in-process
technology into commercially viable products principally related to the
completion of all planning, designing, prototyping, verification and testing
activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to
meet its design specification, including function, features and technical
performance requirements. Panstera had four main product groups under development at the
acquisition date, each contributing from 11% to 41% of the total IPRD
value. The projects included the development of digital and analog receivers as
well as digital processor ICs. The
projects ranged from 50% to 85% complete.
All projects had expected completion dates within one year and an
estimated aggregate cost to complete of $32million. The following table reflects the unaudited combined results of
Pixelworks, Inc. and Panstera, Inc. as if the merger had taken place at the
beginning of the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The proforma information includes
adjustments for non-cash charges for amortization of goodwill and assembled
workforce, over 60 months and 36 months, respectively. Both periods exclude a
charge of $324million for in-process research and development expense.
The proforma information does not necessarily reflect the actual results that
would have occurred nor is it necessarily indicative of future results of
operations of the combined companies.

On January30, 2001, the Company made an investment of $75million in exchange for a 196 equity interest in privately-held Jaldi Semiconductor Corporation Jaldi.
The investment is accounted for at cost and included in other assets on the
balance sheet. Pixelworks and Jaldi
entered into an agreement that gives Pixelworks the option to acquire the
remaining interest in Jaldi in exchange for 185million shares of Pixelworks
common stock. Pixelworks may exercise
its option at any time prior to June30, 2002. The exercise of the option becomes mandatory if Jaldi achieves a
specific development milestone before April1, 2002, which consists of the
JD1 Integrated Circuit shipping to a customer in its production implementation
while meeting agreed upon cost, performance and technical specifications. Upon obtainment of the milestone by Jaldi Pixelworks must either exercise the option within 30 days thereafter or pay
Jaldi $10,000,000. As of the balance
sheet date, Jaldi had not reached its development milestone, however, it is
continuing to make progress towards this milestone. We intend to acquire the remaining interest upon Jaldis
successful completion of this milestone. 6. SEGMENT
INFORMATION In accordance with SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information, Pixelworks has identified a single operating
segment: the design and development of integrated circuits for electronic
display devices. 51 Significant

7. COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES Royalties During 1999, Pixelworks agreed to pay certain suppliers a per unit
royalty based on a certain number of chips sold. Royalties are paid monthly and
expire through November 6, 2006. Royalties are charged to cost of goods sold in
the statement of operations. Pixelworks has recorded $271, $835 and $383 in
royalty expense for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively. 401k
Plan Effective January 1, 1999, Pixelworks implemented a profit-sharing plan
for eligible employees under the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section
401k. Participants may defer a percentage of their annual compensation on a
pre-tax basis, not to exceed the dollar limit that is set by law. A
discretionary matching contribution by Pixelworks is allowed and is equal to a
uniform percentage of the amount of salary reduction elected to be deferred which percentage will be determined each year by Pixelworks. Pixelworks made no
contributions to the 401k plan during 2001, 2000 or 1999. Leases Pixelworks leases office space under various operating leases that
expire at various dates through 2006. Future minimum payments under the leases are as follows 52

Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was 1,112, $453 and $243, respectively. During 1999, Pixelworks entered into a non-cancelable sublease
agreement. The sublease was terminated by the leasee in 2000. Sublease income was $23 and $19 during the
years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, which was offset against rent expense. Contract
Manufacturers In the normal course of business, Pixelworks generally commits to
purchase products from its contract manufacturers to be delivered within the
most recent 90 days covered by forecasts with cancellation fees. In the opinion of management, such
obligations will not significantly affect the Companys financial position or
results of operations. Litigation We are involved in litigation from time to time that is routine in
nature and incidental to the outcome of our business. While management currently believes that the ultimate outcome of
these proceedings, individually and in aggregate, will not have a material
adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows
of the Company, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there
exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the net income of the
period in which the ruling occurs. 8. LICENSE PURCHASE In February of 2000, Pixelworks entered into a perpetual license
agreement with InFocus Systems, Inc. InFocus for the use of its proprietary
automatic pixel clock phase and frequency correction technology specified in
two patents held by InFocus in exchange for 156,863 shares of Series D
preferred stock, valued at $1275 per share, and $24 million in cash, payable
in four equal quarterly installments beginning March 31, 2000. In addition approximately $753 of the patent settlement expense recorded in connection with
the issuance of Series D Preferred Stock to InFocus was based on the difference
between the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock and the Series
D conversion price of $850 per share. Pixelworks also received a release of
any claims InFocus may have against Pixelworks relating to these patents. 53 9. QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA

10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On January 14, 2002, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares
of nDSP, Inc. in exchange for approximately 1,200,000 shares of Pixelworks
stock. The transaction will be accounted
for by the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the results of
operations of nDSP, Inc. will be included in the Companys financial statements
