REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To National HealthCare Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of National HealthCare Corporation
a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareowners' equity, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999. These financial statements are the responsibility of National HealthCare Corporation management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of National HealthCare Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS Board of Directors and Shareowners
National HealthCare Corporation
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of National HealthCare Corporation as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and
shareowners' equity for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
of management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits. The consolidated statements of income, cash flows and shareowners' equity for the year ended
December 31, 2001 were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations and whose report dated
February 5, 2002 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of National HealthCare Corporation at December 31,
2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 2003 the Company changed its method of accounting
for guarantees. s/ Ernst Young LLP Nashville, Tennessee

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   
Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of National HealthCare Corporation and
its subsidiaries NHC or the Company. All material intercompany balances, profits, and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation, and minority interests are reflected in consolidation. Investments in
entities in which we lack control but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and
financial policies are accounted for on the equity method. Investments in entities in which we lack the ability
to exercise significant influence are included in the consolidated financial statements at the lower of the cost
or fair value of our investment. Generally, we operate, manage or provide services to long-term health care centers and home health
care programs located in Southeastern, Midwestern and Western states in the United States. Most recently,
the long-term health care environment has undergone substantial change with regard to Federal and state
reimbursement programs and other payor sources, compliance regulations, competition among other health
care providers and patient care litigation issues. We continually monitor these industry developments as well
as other factors that affect our business. 
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
Net Patient Revenues Gross patient revenues are recorded on an accrual basis based on services rendered at amounts equal
to our established rates. Approximately 71% of our net patient revenues in 2003 and 2002 and
approximately 74% in 2001 are from participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Our long-term health care centers receive payments from the Medicare program under a prospective
payment system PPS. Under this PPS, Medicare pays our centers a fixed fee per Medicare patient per
day, based on the acuity level of the patient, to cover all post-hospital extended care routine service costs,
ancillary costs and capital related costs. Amounts received from Medicaid programs are generally based on
fixed rates subject to program cost ceilings. Our home health care providers also receive payment from the Medicare program under a PPS.
Under this PPS, we are reimbursed from Medicare based on the acuity level of the patient and based on
episodes of care. An episode of care is defined as a length of care up to 60 days with multiple continuous
episodes allowed. The services covered by the episode payment include all disciplines of care, in addition
to medical supplies, within the scope of the home health benefit. Our providers are allowed to make a
request for anticipated payment at the start of care equal to 60% of the expected payment for the initial
episode. The remaining balance due is paid following the submission of the final claim at the end of the
episode. Revenues are recognized when services are provided based on the number of days of service
rendered in the episode. Deferred revenue is recorded for payments received for which the related services
have not yet been provided. For both long-term health care and home health care revenues, allowances for contractual
adjustments are recorded for the differences between our established rates and amounts paid by the Medicare
and Medicaid programs and other third party payors. Contractual adjustments are deducted from gross
patient revenues to determine net patient revenues.  All amounts earned under the Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs are subject to
review by the third party payors. In the opinion of management, adequate provision and reserves have been
made for any adjustments that may result from such reviews, including reviews related to the transition of
payments to the PPS amounts. Any differences between estimated settlements and final determinations are
reflected in operations in the year finalized. NHC recorded $2,683,000 in 2003 and $4,010,000 in 2002 of
net favorable settlements from Medicare and Medicaid for periods prior to the beginning of fiscal 2003 and
2002, respectively, and $457,000 in 2001 of net unfavorable estimated settlements from Medicare and
Medicaid for periods prior to the beginning of fiscal 2001.  With respect to our long-term health care centers, for the cost report years 1997 and 1998 which
were subject to a retrospective reimbursement methodology, we submitted various requests for exceptions
to Medicare routine cost limitations for reimbursement. During 2001, we received preliminary approval on
substantially all of our exception requests, which approvals total approximately $14,186,000. We have in
addition made provisions of approximately $12,761,000 for various Medicare and Medicaid issues for
current and prior years. We recognize revenues associated with the approved exception requests and
provisions when the approvals are assured and the results of final cost report audits are known. These
approvals and audit results are subject to further audit and review by the fiscal intermediaries for a three-year
period. As such, the approved requests and cost report provisions have been included in amounts due to third
party payors in the consolidated balance sheets. The three-year review period will expire in 2004 for
approximately $23,402,000 of routine cost limit exceptions and provisions. These exceptions and provisions
will be eliminated from the amounts due to third party payors and will be recorded as revenues in 2004 if
no further adjustments by the third party payors are made and the exceptions request approvals become
assured and the results of the final cost report audits are known. The amounts recorded during 2003 were
not significant. 
Other Revenues As discussed in Note 5, other revenues include revenues from the provision of insurance,
management and accounting services to other long-term care providers, guarantee fees, advisory fees from
National Health Investors, Inc. NHI and National Health Realty, Inc. NHR, dividends and other
realized gains on marketable securities, equity in earnings of unconsolidated investments, interest income,
rental income and other income. We charge for management and accounting services based on a percentage
of net revenues or based on a fixed fee per bed of the long-term care center under contract. Advisory fees
are based on our contractual agreements with NHI and NHR and are discussed in Notes 2 and 3. We
generally record other revenues on the accrual basis based on the terms of our contractual arrangements.
However, with respect to management and accounting services revenue and interest income from certain
long-term care providers, including National Health Corporation National and NHI, as discussed in Note
5, where collectibility is uncertain or subject to subordination to other expenditures of the long-term care
provider, we recognize the revenues and interest income when the amounts are collected. 
Provision for Doubtful Accounts Provisions for estimated uncollectible accounts are included in other operating expenses.
Property and Equipment We use the straight-line method of depreciation over the expected useful lives of property and
equipment estimated as follows: buildings and improvements, 20-40 years and equipment and furniture, 3-15 years. The provision for depreciation includes the amortization of properties under capital leases. Leasehold improvements attached to properties owned by NHI and NHR are depreciated over the
respective lease terms using the straight-line method. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged against income as incurred. Betterments are
capitalized. We remove the costs and related allowances from the accounts for properties sold or retired,
and any resulting gains or losses are included in income. We include interest costs incurred during
construction periods in the cost of buildings $162,000 in 2003, $40,000 in 2002, and $-0- in 2001. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144, we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying
values of our properties on a property by property basis. We review our properties for recoverability when
events or circumstances, including significant physical changes in the property, significant adverse changes
in general economic conditions, and significant deteriorations of the underlying cash flows of the property,
indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable. The need to recognize an
impairment is based on estimated future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying value of that
property. If recognition of an impairment is necessary, it is measured as the amount by which the carrying
amount of the property exceeds the estimated fair value of the property.
Mortgage and Other Notes Receivable In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, Accounting by Creditors
for Impairment of a Loan - An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 5 and 15 SFAS 114, NHC
evaluates the carrying values of its mortgage and other notes receivable on an instrument by instrument basis.
On a quarterly basis, NHC reviews its notes receivable for recoverability when events or circumstances,
including the non-receipt of principal and interest payments, significant deteriorations of the financial
condition of the borrower and significant adverse changes in general economic conditions, indicate that the
carrying amount of the note receivable may not be recoverable. If necessary, an impairment is measured as
the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the discounted cash flows expected to be received under
the note receivable or, if foreclosure is probable, the fair value of the collateral securing the note receivable.
Investments in Marketable Securities Our investments in marketable securities include available for sale securities, which are recorded
at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are recorded in shareowners' equity
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities SFAS 115. 
Goodwill Adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets SFAS 142 required that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not
amortized but are subject to impairment tests based on their estimated fair value. The adoption of SFAS 142
effective January 1, 2002 resulted in the cessation of goodwill amortization of approximately $247,000 per
year. Unamortized goodwill is continually reviewed for impairment in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS 142.
Other Assets Deferred financing costs are amortized principally by the effective interest method over the terms
of the related debt obligations. 
Income Taxes We utilize Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
which requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax laws that will be in
effect when the differences are expected to reverse. See Note 11 for further discussion of our accounting
for income taxes.
Concentration of Credit Risks Our credit risks primarily relate to cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash held by trustees,
accounts receivable, marketable securities and notes receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are primarily
held in bank accounts and overnight investments. Restricted cash is primarily invested in commercial paper
and certificates of deposit with financial institutions and other interest bearing accounts. Accounts
receivable consist primarily of amounts due from patients funded approximately 87% through Medicare,
Medicaid, and other contractual programs and approximately 13% through private payors and from other
health care companies for management, accounting and other services. We perform continual credit
evaluations of our clients and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts on these accounts receivable.
Marketable securities are held primarily in accounts with brokerage institutions. Notes receivable relate
primarily to secured loans with health care facilities recorded as notes receivable in the consolidated balance
sheets and to secured notes receivable from officers, directors and supervisory employees recorded as
reductions in shareowner equity in the consolidated balance sheets as discussed in Notes 9 and 12. We
also have notes receivable from NHR as discussed in Note 2 and from National and the National Health
Corporation Leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan ESOP as discussed in Note 4. Our financial instruments, principally our notes receivable, are subject to the possibility of loss of
the carrying values as a result of either the failure of other parties to perform according to their contractual
obligations or changes in market prices which may make the instruments less valuable. We obtain various
collateral and other protective rights, and continually monitor these rights in order to reduce such
possibilities of loss. We evaluate the need to provide reserves for potential losses on our financial
instruments based on management periodic review of the portfolio on an instrument by instrument basis.
See Notes 2, 4, 9 and 12 for additional information on the notes receivable.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three
months.
Restricted Cash Restricted cash primarily represents cash that is held by trustees and cash that is held for the purpose
of our workers' compensation insurance, professional liability insurance, and a loan repurchase obligation.
Inventories Inventories consist generally of food and supplies and are valued at the lower of cost or market, with
cost determined on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis.
Other Current Liabilities Other current liabilities primarily represents accruals for current federal and state income taxes, real
estate taxes, debt service rent and other current liabilities.
Accrued Risk Reserves We are principally self-insured for risks related to employee health insurance, workers'
compensation and professional and general liability claims. Accrued risk reserves primarily represent the
accrual for self-insured risks associated with employee health insurance, workers' compensation and
professional and general liability claims. The accrued risk reserves include a liability for reported claims
and estimates for incurred but unreported claims. Our policy with respect to a significant portion of our
workers' compensation and professional and general liability claims is to use an actuary to support the
estimates recorded for incurred but unreported claims. Our health insurance reserve is based on our known
claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but unreported claims determined by our analysis of historical
claims paid. We reassess our accrued risk reserves on a quarterly basis, with changes in estimated losses
being recorded in the consolidated statements of income in the period identified.
Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation arrangements under the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and related
interpretations. We have adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123, as amended. As a result,
no compensation cost has been recognized in the consolidated statements of income for NHC stock option
plan.  Had compensation cost for our stock option plans been determined based on the fair value at the
grant date of awards consistent with the provisions of SFAS 123, our net income and earnings per share
would have been as follows dollars in thousands, except per share amounts

Deferred Lease Credit-- Deferred lease credits include amounts being amortized to properly reflect expenses on a straight
line basis under the terms of our existing lease agreements. 
Other Noncurrent Liabilities Other noncurrent liabilities include reserves related to various income tax, guarantee and other
contingencies. With respect to guarantee obligations in place prior to January 1, 2003, we account for our
obligations under guarantee agreements in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Accounting
Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies SFAS 5. For guarantee obligations assumed
subsequent to January 1, 2003, consistent with the provisions of Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others FIN 45, at the inception of guarantee agreement, we recognize a liability for the estimated fair
value of the obligation assumed.  We account for our contingent liabilities for income tax matters in accordance with the provisions
of SFAS 5. Contingent liabilities for income tax matters include amounts for income taxes and interest
thereon and are the result of the potential alternative interpretations of tax laws and the judgmental nature
of the timing of recognition of taxable income. 
Deferred Revenue-- Deferred revenue includes the deferred gain on the sale of assets to National as discussed in Note
4, certain amounts related to episodic payments received by our home health care providers in advance of
providing services as discussed in Note 1 and entrance fees that have been and are currently being received
upon reservation and occupancy of retirement center units for a continuing care retirement community we
own. In accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Audit and Accounting
Guide, Health Care Organizations, the entrance fees have been recorded as deferred revenue. The
refundable portion 90% of the entrance fees is being recognized over the life of the facility while the non-refundable portion 10% is being recognized over the remaining life expectancy of the residents. 
Comprehensive Income-- Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income requires
that changes in the amounts of certain items, including gains and losses on certain securities, be shown in
the consolidated financial statements as comprehensive income. We report our comprehensive income in
the consolidated statements of shareowners' equity.
Segment Disclosures Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report
information about operating segments in annual and interim financial reports issued to stockholders.
Management believes that substantially all of our operations are part of the long-term health care industry
segment. Our operations outside of the long-term health care industry segment are not material. See Note
5 for a detail of other revenues provided within the long-term health care industry segment. Information
about the costs and expenses associated with each of the components of other revenues is not separately
identifiable. 
Prior Year Reclassifications Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
New Accounting Pronouncements From June 1998 through June 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities SFAS 133 and various amendments and interpretations. SFAS 133, as amended, establishes
accounting and reporting standards requiring that any derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet
as either an asset or liability measured at its estimated fair value. SFAS 133 requires that changes in the
derivative estimated fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria
are met. We adopted SFAS 133, as amended, effective January 1, 2001.  Through November 30, 2000, our investments in marketable securities included a debt security
convertible into common stock of the issuing company. SFAS 133 requires that we account for such debt
security as two separate instruments: a purchased call option on the issuer stock and a nonconvertible
interest-bearing debt security. Because we were not using the purchased call option as a hedging instrument,
SFAS 133 requires that we report changes in the fair value of the separated call option currently in earnings.
In addition, we are required to accrete the resulting discount on the nonconvertible debt security into income
over the remaining term of the nonconvertible debt security. At December 31, 2000, the fair value of the
purchased call option, as determined using an option pricing model, was approximately $299,000. The
change in the fair value of the purchased call option resulted in an increase to other revenues and pretax net
income of $367,000 between January 1, 2001 and through November 30, 2001, at which time the debt
security was converted into common stock of the issuing company. The common stock received in
connection with the conversion is recorded as available for sale marketable securities at December 31, 2003
and 2002. In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business
Combinations SFAS 141 and SFAS 142. SFAS 141 supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 16, Business Combinations and requires all business combinations to be accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting. In addition, SFAS 141 requires that identifiable intangible assets be
recognized apart from goodwill based on meeting certain criteria. SFAS 142 supersedes Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 17, Intangible Assets and addresses how intangible assets and goodwill
should be accounted for upon and after acquisition. Specifically, goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but will be subject to impairment tests based on their estimated
fair value. We adopted SFAS 141 effective July 1, 2001 and SFAS 142 effective January 1, 2002. The
adoption of SFAS 142 resulted in the cessation of goodwill amortization of approximately $247,000 per year.
At December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 goodwill was $3,033,000. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, which addresses financial accounting and reporting
for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed Of SFAS 121, and the accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of
a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions APB 30,
for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in APB 30. SFAS 144 retains the
fundamental provisions of SFAS 121 for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long-lived assets
held for use and long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, while also resolving significant implementation
issues associated with SFAS 121. SFAS 144 also broadens the scope of defining discontinued operations.
NHC adopted SFAS 144 on January 1, 2002. The adoption of SFAS 144 has not had a significant effect on
our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, Rescission
of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections
SFAS 145. SFAS 145 rescinds Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 4, Reporting Gains
and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt SFAS 4, which required all gains and losses from
extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of the
related income tax effect. As a result, the criteria in APB 30 will now be used to classify those gains and
losses. SFAS 145 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases
SFAS 13 to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale-leaseback
transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale-leaseback transactions. The provisions of SFAS
145 are effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002, and interim periods
within those fiscal years. The adoption of SFAS 145 effective January 1, 2003 did not have a significant
effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN 45. FIN 45 requires that the guarantor recognize, at the
inception of certain guarantees, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing such
guarantees. FIN 45 also requires additional disclosure requirements about the guarantor obligations under
certain guarantees that it has issued. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this
interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31,
2002. As discussed in Notes 9 and 13, in connection with a loan purchase obligation agreement executed in
2003, we have recognized a liability of $5,124,000 based on the provisions of FIN 45 and the estimated fair
value of our obligation under this guarantee.  
In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
FIN 46, which requires the consolidation of variable interest entities. FIN 46 is generally applicable to
NHC effective March 31, 2004. Disclosures are required currently if the Company expects to consolidate
any variable interest entities. The Company is currently evaluating the requirement to consolidate any
additional material entities as a result of FIN 46. 
Note 2 - Relationship with National Health Realty, Inc. In 1997, we formed NHR as a wholly-owned subsidiary. We then transferred to NHR certain
healthcare facilities then owned by NHC and distributed the shares of NHR to NHC shareholders. The
distribution had the effect of separating NHC and NHR into two independent public companies. As a result
of the distribution, all of the outstanding shares of NHR were distributed to the then NHC investors. NHR
is listed on the American Stock Exchange. 
Leases On December 31, 1997, concurrent with our conveyance of certain assets to NHR, we leased from
NHR the real property of 16 long-term health care centers, six assisted living facilities and one retirement
center. Each lease is for an initial term expiring December 31, 2007, with two additional five year renewal
terms at our option, assuming no defaults. We account for the leases as operating leases. During the initial term and each renewal term, we are obligated to pay NHR annual base rent on all
23 facilities of $15,405,000. In addition to base rent, in each year after 1999, we must pay percentage rent
to NHR equal to 3% of the increase in the gross revenues of each facility. The percentage rent is based on
a quarterly calculation of revenue increases and is payable on a quarterly basis. Percentage rent for 2003,
2002 and 2001 was approximately $1,128,000, $805,000, and $425,000, respectively. Each lease with NHR
is a triple net lease under which we are responsible for paying all taxes, utilities, insurance premium costs,
repairs and other charges relating to the ownership of the facilities. We are obligated at our expense to
maintain adequate insurance on the facilities' assets. We have a right of first refusal with NHR to purchase any of the properties transferred from us
should NHR receive an offer from an unrelated party during the term of the lease or up to 180 days after
termination of the related lease. On October 1, 2000, we terminated our individual leases on nine Florida health care facilities owned
by NHR. However, we remain obligated under our master lease agreement with NHR and continue to
remain obligated to make the lease payments to NHR. Subsequently, the facilities were leased by NHR for
a five year term to nine separate corporations, none of which we own or control. Lease payments received
by NHR from the new lessees offset our lease obligations pursuant to the master operating lease. Through
December 31, 2003, all such lease payments have been received by NHR and offset against our obligations. At December 31, 2003, the approximate future minimum base rent commitments to be paid by us
on non-cancelable operating leases with NHR are as follows Total Commitments Including

Thereafter Advisory Agreement-- We have entered into an Advisory Agreement with NHR whereby we provide to NHR services
related to investment activities and day-to-day management and operations. With respect to advisory
services provided to NHR, we are subject to the supervision of and policies established by NHR Board of
Directors. Either party may terminate the NHR Advisory Agreement on 90 days notice at any time. Our
executive management officers serve in the same executive positions for NHR. For our services under the NHR Advisory Agreement, we are entitled to annual compensation of the
greater of 2% of NHR gross consolidated revenues or the actual expenses we incurred. During 2003,
2002, and 2001, our compensation under the NHR Advisory Agreement was $467,000, $493,000 and
$507,000, respectively. Pursuant to the NHR Advisory Agreement, NHR has agreed that as long as we are obligated on both
the NHR Advisory Agreement and a similar Advisory Agreement with NHI, NHR will only do business with
us and will not compete with NHI. As a result, NHR is severely limited in its ability to grow and expand
its business. Furthermore, we and the NHR Board of Directors will not seek additional investments to
expand NHR investment portfolio. Therefore, we do not expect our advisory fees from NHR to increase.
Note Receivable from NHR In December 2003, in order to increase our return on previously uninvested cash, we loaned
approximately $14,924,000 to NHR. NHR used the proceeds of the loan to exercise its right to repurchase
certain first mortgage notes receivable which had previously been sold to NHI. The note from NHR requires
monthly interest payments at the 30 day LIBOR plus 225% or at 4%, whichever is greater. The entire
principal is due December 31, 2005. 
Investment in NHR Common Stock At December 31, 2003, we own 363,200 shares or 38% of NHR outstanding common stock. We
account for our investment in NHR common stock as available for sale marketable securities in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS 115. 
Note 3 - Relationship with National Health Investors, Inc. In 1991, we formed NHI as a wholly-owned subsidiary. We then transferred to NHI certain
healthcare facilities owned by NHC and distributed the shares of NHI to NHC shareholders. The
distribution had the effect of separating NHC and NHI into two independent public companies. As a result
of the distribution, all of the outstanding shares of NHI were distributed to the then NHC investors. NHI is
listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Leases On October 17, 1991, concurrent with our conveyance of real property to NHI, we leased from NHI
the real property of 40 long-term health care centers and three retirement centers. Each lease is for an initial
term expiring December 31, 2001, with two additional five-year renewal terms at our option, assuming no
defaults. During 2000, we exercised our option to extend the lease term for the first five-year renewal term
under the same terms and conditions as the initial term. We account for the leases as operating leases. During the initial term and first renewal term of the leases, we are obligated to pay NHI annual base
rent on all 43 facilities of $19,355,000 as adjusted for new construction since inception. If we exercise our
option to extend the leases for the second renewal term, the base rent will be the then fair rental value as
negotiated with NHI. The leases also obligate us to pay as debt service rent all payments of interest and principal due
under each mortgage to which the conveyance of the facilities was subject. The payments are required over
the remaining life of the mortgages as of the conveyance date, but only during the term of the lease.
Payments for debt service rent are being treated by us as payments of principal and interest if we remain
obligated on the debt obligated debt service rent and as operating expense payments if we have been
relieved of the debt obligation by the lender non-obligated debt service rent. See Accounting Treatment
of the Transfer for further discussion. In addition to base rent and debt service rent, we must pay percentage rent to NHI equal to 3% of
the increase in the gross revenues of each facility. The percentage rent is based on a quarterly calculation
of revenue increases and is payable on a quarterly basis. Percentage rent for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was
approximately $3,708,000, $3,695,000, and $2,865,000, respectively. Each lease with NHI is a triple net lease under which we are responsible for paying all taxes,
utilities, insurance premium costs, repairs and other charges relating to the ownership of the facilities. We
are obligated at our expense to maintain adequate insurance on the facilities' assets. We have a right of first refusal with NHI to purchase any of the properties transferred from us should
NHI receive an offer from an unrelated party during the term of the lease or up to 180 days after termination
of the related lease. On October 1, 2000, we terminated our individual leases with NHI on four Florida long-term health
care facilities. However, we remain obligated to NHI under our master lease agreement and continue to
remain obligated to make the lease payments to NHI. Subsequently, the facilities were immediately leased
by NHI for a five year term to four separate corporations, none of which we own or control. Lease payments
received by NHI from the new lessees offset our lease obligations pursuant to the master operating lease.
Through December 31, 2003, all such lease payments have been received by NHI and offset against our
obligations. Base rent expense to NHI was $19,355,000 in 2003, 2002 and 2001. Non-obligated debt service rent
to NHI was $7,369,000 in 2003, $6,828,000 in 2002, and $6,289,000 in 2001. At December 31, 2003, the
approximate future minimum base rent and non-obligated debt service rent to be paid by us on non-cancelable operating leases with NHI during the initial term are as follows Total Commitments Including

Advisory Agreement We have entered into an Advisory Agreement with NHI whereby we provide to NHI services related
to investment activities and day-to-day management and operations. With respect to advisory services
provided to NHI, we are subject to the supervision of and policies established by NHI Board of Directors.
Either party may terminate the NHI Advisory Agreement on 90 days notice at any time. Our executive
management officers serve in the same executive positions for NHI. For our services under the NHI Advisory Agreement, we are entitled to annual compensation of
$1,625,000, a reimbursement of certain out of pocket expenses and an additional amount that is calculated
on a formula that is related to the increase in NHI funds from operations per common share as defined in
the NHI Advisory Agreement. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, our compensation under the NHI Advisory
Agreement was $2,597,000, $2,479,000 and $2,147,000, respectively.
Management Services NHI operates certain long-term health care centers on which it has foreclosed, has accepted deeds
in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise has obtained possession of the related assets. NHI has engaged us to
manage these foreclosure properties. See Notes 1 and 5 for additional information on management fees
recognized from NHI. 
Accounting Treatment of the Transfer We have accounted for the conveyance in 1991 of assets and related debt to NHI and the
subsequent leasing of the real estate assets as a financing/leasing arrangement. Since we remain obligated
on certain of the transferred debt, the obligated debt balances have been reflected on the consolidated balance
sheets as debt serviced by other parties. As of December 31, 2003, we remain obligated on $1,926,000 of
debt serviced by other parties. As we utilize the applicable real estate over the lease term, our consolidated
statements of income will reflect the continued interest expenses on the obligated debt balances and the
additional base and non-obligated debt service rents as an operating expense payable to NHI each year.
We have indemnification provisions in our agreements with NHI if we are required to service the debt
through a default by NHI.
Release from Debt Serviced by Other Parties Since 1991, we have been released from our obligation on a significant portion of transferred debt.
Since we are no longer obligated on this transferred debt, debt serviced by other parties and assets under
arrangement with other parties were reduced by the amount of the debt serviced by other parties from which
we were removed. The resulting deferred lease credit is being amortized into income over the remaining
lease term. The leases with NHI provide that we shall continue to make non-obligated debt service rent
payments equal to the debt service including principal and interest on the obligated debt from which we have
been released. 
Investment in NHI Common Stock At December 31, 2003, we own 1,280,442 shares or 48% of NHI outstanding common stock.
We account for our investment in NHI common stock as available for sale marketable securities in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 115. 
Note 4 - Relationship with National Health Corporation National, which is wholly-owned by the ESOP, was formed in 1986 and served as our administrative
general partner through December 31, 1997, when we operated as a master limited partnership. As discussed
below, the personnel conducting our business, including our executive management team, are employees of
National and have ownership interest in National through their participation in the ESOP.
Sale of Long-Term Health Care Centers to and Notes Receivable from National During 1988, we sold the assets inventory, property and equipment of eight long-term health care
centers 1,121 licensed beds to National for a total consideration of $40,000,000. The consideration
consisted of $30,000,000 in cash and a $10,000,000 note receivable due December 31, 2007. The note
receivable earns interest at 85%. We have agreed to manage the centers under a 20-year management
contract for management fees comparable to those in the industry. With our prior consent, National sold one
center to an unrelated third party in 1997 and two centers to an unrelated third party in 1999. Thus, we now
manage five centers for National. See Notes 1 and 5 for additional information on management fees
recognized from National. Our carrying amount in the assets sold was approximately $24,255,000. The resulting profit of
$15,745,000 was deferred and will be amortized into income beginning with the collection of the note
receivable up to $12,000,000 with the balance $3,745,000 of the profit being amortized into income on
a straight-line basis over the management contract period. In conjunction with our management contract, we have entered into a line of credit arrangement
whereby we may have amounts due to or due from National from time to time. The maximum available
borrowings under the line of credit are $2,000,000, the interest rate on the line of credit is prime plus one
percent and the final maturity is January 1, 2004. As of December 31, 2003 NHC owes National $272,000
under this arrangement. As of December 31, 2002, National owed NHC $868,000 under this arrangement.
These amounts have been included in or netted against notes receivable from National on the consolidated
balance sheets. After January 1, 2004, we are no longer obligated to make loans under the line of credit
arrangement. We may, however, make short-term loans in the regular course of business. 
ESOP Financing Activities During 1988, we obtained from National long-term financing of $8,500,000 for the construction of
our headquarters building. National obtained its financing through the ESOP. The note requires quarterly
principal and interest payments with interest at 9% and is secured by the headquarters building. At
December 31, 2003 and 2002, the outstanding balance on the note was approximately $2,075,000 and
$2,594,000, respectively, which is included in notes and other obligations in Note 10. The building is owned
by a separate partnership of which we are the general partner and building tenants are limited partners. We
own 697% of the partnership and consolidate the financial statements of the partnership in our consolidated
financial statements. The cumulative equity in earnings of the partnership related to the limited partners'
ownership is reflected in minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries. We have guaranteed the debt
service of the building partnership. In addition, our $7,442,000 senior secured notes and our $1,486,000 senior notes described in Note
10 were financed by National. National obtained its financing through the ESOP. Our interest costs,
financing expenses and principal payments with National are consistent with National and the ESOP terms
with their respective lenders. We also have agreed to guarantee $12,145,000 of additional debt of National
and the ESOP that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 13 for additional
information on guarantees.  During 1991, we borrowed $10,000,000 from National. The term note payable requires quarterly
interest payments at 85%. The entire principal is due at maturity in 2008.
Payroll and Related Services The personnel conducting our business, including our executive management team, are employees
of National and have ownership interest in National through their participation in the ESOP. National
provides payroll services, provides employee fringe benefits, and maintains certain liability insurance. We
pay to National all the costs of personnel employed for our benefit, as well as an administrative fee equal
to 1% of payroll costs. Such costs are reflected as salaries, wages and benefits in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income. The administrative fee paid to National for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was
$2,138,000, $2,084,000 and $1,844,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, we owed
National $272,000 and National owed us $868,000, respectively, as a result of the differences between
interim payments for payroll and benefits services costs that we made during the respective year and such
actual costs. These receivables are included in or netted against notes receivable from National in the
consolidated balance sheets. National maintains and makes contributions to its ESOP for the benefit of
eligible employees.
Notes Receivable from the ESOP During 2000, we purchased at face value from NHI $23,200,000 of notes receivable due from the
ESOP. NHI had purchased the note receivable from the previous holders. The total outstanding balance of
the notes receivable was $5,714,000 and $17,857,000 as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
notes receivable represent funds that were originally obtained by the ESOP from outside lenders and loaned
to National and subsequently loaned by National to NHI, NHR and NHC. NHI is the ultimate obligor on
$2,400,000 of the notes, NHR is the ultimate obligor on $1,828,000 of the notes, and we are the ultimate
obligor on $1,486,000 of the notes. The notes bear interest at 84%. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually. Previously suspended principal payments were made effective December 1, 2003. The final
maturity of the notes is December 1, 2005.
National Ownership of Our Stock At December 31, 2003, National owns 1,271,147 shares or 110% of our outstanding common
stock.
Note 5 - Other Revenues and Income Other revenues are outlined in the table below. Revenues from insurance services include premiums
for workers' compensation and professional and general liability insurance policies that our wholly-owned
insurance subsidiaries have written for certain long-term health care centers to which we provide
management or accounting services. Revenues from management and accounting services include
management and accounting fees and revenues from other services provided to managed and other long-term
health care centers. Other revenues include non-health care related earnings. in thousands Year ended December 31 2003

management fees and interest on management fees. Consistent with our policy described in Note 1, we
recognized no management fees from National in 2001. Unrecognized and unpaid management fees from
National total $7,997,000 and $6,067,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The receipt of
payment for these fees is subject to collectibility issues and negotiation. Consistent with our policy, we will
only recognize these unrecognized fees as revenues if and when cash is collected. 
Management Fees from NHI During 2003, 2002 and 2001, we recognized $1,392,000, $1,465,000, and $962,000, respectively,
of management fees from long-term care centers owned by NHI, which amounts are included in management
and accounting service fees. Unrecognized and unpaid management fees from NHI total $10,165,000 and
$8,085,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The receipt of payment for these fees is subject
to collectibility issues and negotiation. Consistent with our policy, we will only recognize these
unrecognized fees as revenue if and when cash is collected. 
Accounting Service Fees and Rental Income from Florida Centers During 2003, 2002 and 2001, we recognized $5,368,000, $4,960,000 and $5,526,000, respectively,
of accounting services fees from long-term health care centers in Florida that we previously operated or
managed. Amounts recognized are included in management and accounting service fees.  During 2003, 2002 and 2001, we also recognized $3,548,000, $3,623,000 and $3,739,000,
respectively, of rental income from the divested operations of long-term health care centers in Florida related
to our two owned facilities and the furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements of 13 other facilities
previously leased from NHI and NHR. These amounts are included in rental income.

from managed and other long-term health care centers, the proceeds of which were used by the long-term
health care centers for construction costs, development costs incurred during construction and working
capital during initial operating periods. The notes generally require monthly payments with maturities
beginning in 2004 through 2007. Interest on the notes is generally at rates ranging from prime plus 2% to
1025%. The collateral for the notes consists of first and second mortgages, certificates of need, personal
guarantees and stock pledges. During 2002, based on analyses consistent with the provisions of SFAS 114,
we concluded that two of our notes receivable were impaired and that write-downs were required. During
the first quarter of 2002, we wrote-off a $2,760,000 mortgage note receivable from a long-term health care
facility in Missouri. During the third quarter of 2002, we wrote-down $5,200,000 of a mortgage note
receivable from a long-term health care facility in Tennessee. Our recorded investment in these impaired
notes receivable was $-0- and $7,246,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. With respect to
these impaired notes receivable, during 2003, 2002 and 2001, our average recorded investment was
$5,309,000, $14,076,000 and $13,136,000, respectively, and the interest income recognized was $690,000 74,000, and $99,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, we have not provided an allowance for loan
losses. We continually monitor and evaluate the carrying amount of our notes receivable in accordance with
SFAS 114. In December 2003, we received full repayment approximately $12,000,000 of the mortgage note
receivable from the long-term health care facility located in Tennessee. The repayment resulted in a recovery
of the mortgage note receivable previously written down by approximately $5,124,000. In order to repay
NHC, the facility obtained financing from a commercial bank. As a part of the transaction, we agreed to
purchase the loan from the lending bank in the event of a default and agreed to collateralize such purchase
obligation with $12,000,000 of cash. Consistent with the provisions of FIN 45, we have recorded a liability
for our guarantees in the amount of $5,124,000, which is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheet.

cross-default provisions with other debt of National. Certain loan agreements require maintenance of
specified operating ratios as well as specified levels of working capital and shareowners' equity by us and
by National. All such covenants have been met by us and we believe that National is in compliance with or
has obtained waivers or amendments to remedy all events of non-compliance with the covenants as of
December 31, 2003. Our failure or the failure of National to meet the required covenants would have a
material adverse effect on our financial position and cash flows.
Lease Commitments Operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 include expenses for
leased premises and equipment under operating leases of $41,537,000, $41,322,000, and $41,259,000,
respectively. See Notes 2 and 3 for the approximate future minimum rent commitments on non-cancelable

may allow for alternative interpretations or where the timing of recognition of income is subject to judgment.
We believe we have adequate provisions for tax contingencies. However, because of uncertainty of
interpretation by various tax authorities and the possibility that there are issues that have not been recognized
by management, we cannot guarantee we have accurately estimated our tax liabilities. 
Note 12 - Stock Option Plan We have incentive option plans that provide for the granting of options to key employees and
directors to purchase shares of common stock at no less than market value on the date of grant. Options
issued to non-employee directors vest immediately. Options issued to employees vest over a six year period.

remaining contractual life of options outstanding at December 31, 2003 is 28 years. Additionally, we have an employee stock purchase plan that allows employees to purchase our shares
of stock through payroll deductions. The plan allows employees to terminate participation at any time. In connection with the exercise of certain stock options, we have received 557% interest-bearing,
full recourse notes in the amount of $16,000 at December 31, 2003. The notes are secured by shares of NHC,
shares of NHR, or shares of NHI having a fair market value of not less than 150% of the amount of the note.
The principal balances of the notes are reflected as a reduction of shareowners' equity in the consolidated
financial statements.  During 2001, we awarded $7,815,000 of cash bonuses paid in 2002 to employees with existing
employee notes payable to us. The bonus allowed the employees to retire certain of their remaining notes
with us. The bonus has been included in salaries, wages and benefits in the 2001 consolidated statement of
income.  During 2003, we accepted unexercised stock options for 55,000 shares of our common stock from
a former employee and current member of our board of directors in satisfaction of that individual $433,000
note payable to us. We recognized $433,000 of salaries, wages and benefits expense in the 2003
consolidated statement of income. 
Note 13 - Contingencies and Guarantees Self Insurance 	We have assumed certain self-insurance risks related to health insurance, workers' compensation
and general and professional liability insurance claims both of our owned or leased entities and certain of
the entities to which we provide management or accounting services. The liability we have recognized for
reported claims and estimates for incurred but unreported claims is $43,953,000 and $31,632,000 at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The liability is included in accrued risk reserves in the
consolidated balance sheets. The amounts are subject to adjustment for actual claims incurred. It is possible
that these claims plus unasserted claims could exceed our insurance coverages and our reserves, which would
have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
General and Professional Liability Lawsuits and Insurance Nationwide, the entire long term care industry has experienced a dramatic increase in personal
injury/wrongful death claims and awards based on alleged negligence by nursing facilities and their
employees in providing care to residents. As of December 31, 2003, we and/or our managed centers are
currently defendants in 77 such claims covering the years 1995 through December 31, 2003. Forty-two of
these suits are in Florida, where we have not operated or managed long-term care providers since September
30, 2000. In addition, 24 suits are currently pending in relation to the September 25, 2003 fire discussed
below. When bids were solicited for third party professional liability insurance coverage for 2002, only two
companies would quote coverage. Both quotations were so onerous and expensive that we elected to pay
the premiums into a wholly-owned licensed insurance company. Thus, during 2002 and 2003, insurance
coverage for incidents occurring at all providers owned or leased, and most providers managed by us, is
provided through this wholly-owned insurance company.  Our coverages for all years include primary policies and umbrella policies. For years 1999 through
2001 forward, the policies contain a per incident deductible. In 2000 and 2001, there is no aggregate limit
on our potential deductible obligations. In 2002, the deductibles were eliminated and first dollar coverage
is provided through the wholly-owned insurance company, while the excess coverage is provided by a third
party insuror.  In 2003, primary professional liability insurance coverage and excess coverage is provided through
our wholly-owned liability insurance company in the amount of $1 million per incident, $3 million per
location with an aggregate primary policy limit of $110 million and a $75 million annual excess aggregate.
As a result of the terms of our insurance policies and our use of a wholly-owned insurance company,
we have retained significant self insurance risk with respect to general and professional liability. We use
independent actuaries to estimate our exposures for claims obligations for both asserted and unasserted
claims related to deductibles and exposures in excess of coverage limits, and we maintain reserves for these
obligations. It is possible that claims against us could exceed our coverage limits and our reserves, which
would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
Nashville Fire On September 25, 2003, a tragic and as of yet unexplained fire occurred on the second floor of a
skilled nursing facility located in Nashville, Tennessee operated by one of our limited liability company
subsidiaries. While the concrete and steel constructed facility complied with applicable fire safety codes,
the building was not equipped with fire sprinklers. Although the fire was limited to a double bedded
patient room, extensive smoke filled the area and caused injuries to other patients despite aggressive efforts
to evacuate these patients by NHC employees, fire department personnel and other volunteers. There have
been sixteen patient deaths since the fire, an undetermined number of which may be related to the events of
September 25, 2003. The fire produced extensive media coverage, specifically focused on the fact that health care centers,
including hospitals, constructed prior to 1994 are not required by Tennessee law or regulations to be fully
sprinkled if constructed with fire resistant materials. We have announced that irrespective of code standards,
we will commence a process of fully sprinkling all facilities operated by NHC that are not already fully
sprinkled. We have created through our National Health Foundation a qualified 501c3 charity a patient
and family relief fund, which is being administered separately from other funds of the Foundation by families
of Nashville patients. The prayers and best wishes of the NHC family partners have gone forth to all patients
and families affected by this fire. We are proactively seeking to resolve any questions and/or losses with
our patients and their families, and will continue to do so until all matters are resolved. There are 24 lawsuits
currently pending. The cases have been consolidated in the Third Circuit Court for Davidson County,
Tennessee. Discovery is ongoing. The Company plans to vigorously defend against the allegations in these
lawsuits and seek settlements with residents and their families. Additionally, in connection with the fire, we have incurred losses and costs associated with physical
damage to the health care center and interruption of business, as we have closed the center for an indefinite
period of time. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we have received or accrued $565,000 of insurance
recoveries from third-party insurance carriers. These insurance recoveries have reduced our losses and costs
and have been included in other operating expenses in the 2003 consolidated statement of income. The building involved in the fire is leased by one of our limited liability company subsidiaries from
NHI. Under the terms of the lease with NHI, we are required to restore the leased property so as to make
it at least equal in value to that which existed prior to the damage. The lease also requires us to indemnify
and hold harmless NHI from any and all demands and claims arising from the use of the property, including
any negligence or violation by us.  A provision of the lease allows that if substantial damage occurs during the lease term, we may
terminate the lease with respect to the damaged property. If the lease is so terminated, we will have no
obligation to repair the property and NHI will receive the entire insurance proceeds related to the building
damage. We are obligated to continue to indemnify and hold harmless NHI from any and all demands
arising from the use of the property. NHI retains the right to license the beds under any lease termination. Consistent with the provisions of SFAS 5, we have accrued for probable and estimatible losses
related to the Nashville fire and have included our estimates of these losses in accrued risk reserves in the
consolidated balance sheet. It is possible that claims against us related to the Nashville fire could exceed
our estimates, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and
cash flows.
Guarantees In addition to our primary debt obligations, which are included in our consolidated financial
statements, we have guaranteed the debt obligations of certain other entities. Those guarantees, which are
not included as debt obligations in our consolidated financial statements, total $27,640,000 at December 31,
2003 and include $15,495,000 of debt of managed and other long-term health care centers and $12,145,000
of debt of National and the ESOP.  The $15,495,000 of guarantees of debt of managed and other long-term health care centers relates
to first mortgage debt obligations of three long-term health care centers to which we provide management
or accounting services. We have agreed to guarantee these obligations in order to obtain management or
accounting services agreements. For this service, we charge an annual guarantee fee of 1% to 2% of the
outstanding principal balance guaranteed, which fee is in addition to our management or accounting services
fee. All of this guaranteed indebtedness is secured by first mortgages, pledges of personal property, accounts
receivable, marketable securities and, in certain instances, the personal guarantees of the owners of the
facilities.  The $12,145,000 of guarantees of debt of National and the ESOP relates to senior secured notes held
by financial institutions. The total outstanding balance of National and the ESOP obligations under these
senior secured notes is $19,587,000. As discussed in Note 10, $7,442,000 of this obligation has been
included in our debt obligations because we are a direct obligor on this indebtedness. The remaining
$12,145,000, which is not included in our debt obligations because we are not a direct obligor, is due from
NHI to National and the ESOP and ultimately to the financial institutions. Additionally, under the amended
terms of these note agreements, the lending institutions have the right to put to us the entire outstanding
balance of this debt on March 31, 2005. Upon exercise of this put option by the lending institutions, we
would be obligated to purchase the then outstanding balance of these senior secured notes, which is estimated
to be approximately $15,116,000.  Additionally, as discussed in Note 9, we are obligated to purchase a loan made by a commercial bank
to a long-term health care center in the event there is a default under the credit agreement between the parties.
NHC obligation to repurchase the loan is collateralized by cash in an amount equal to the loan balances.
The term of the repurchase obligation coincides with the term of the loan, which matures December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2003, our maximum potential loss related to the guarantees is $34,516,000,
which is the outstanding balance of the guaranteed debt obligations. We have accrued approximately
$6,168,000 for potential losses as a result of our guarantees.
Debt Cross Defaults Through a guarantee agreement, our senior secured notes have cross-default provisions with other
debt of National and the ESOP. We currently believe that National and the ESOP are in compliance with
the terms of their debt agreements. Under the terms of one of National debt obligations to financial
institutions total balance of $8,838,000 at December 31, 2003, none of which is our obligation, the lending
institutions have the right to put the entire outstanding balance of the debt to National in March 2005.
National plans to be able to refinance this debt prior to the put date or pay off the debt completely. However,
if the lending institutions do exercise that put option and National is unable to purchase or refinance the
entire outstanding balance of the debt, National other debt along with our senior secured notes and
substantially all of our other debt would be in default, which would have a material adverse effect on NHC
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
