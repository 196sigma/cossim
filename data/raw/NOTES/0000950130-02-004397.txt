NOTE 2--BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes to
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Workflow, including
companies acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase
method from their respective dates of acquisition. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
NOTE 3--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant
estimates include accounts receivable and inventory reserves, useful lives of
fixed and intangible assets and recovery of goodwill.
Definition of Fiscal Year
As used in these consolidated financial statements and related notes to
consolidated financial statements, Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal
2000 refer to the Company fiscal years ended April 30, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. During Fiscal 2000, the Company Board of Directors approved a
change in the definition of the Company fiscal year-end date from the last
Saturday in April to April 30th of each year. As a result of this change, Fiscal
2002 and 2001 were comprised of 365 days as compared to Fiscal 2000 which was
comprised of 372 days.

Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made in the Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal
2000 financial statements to conform to the Fiscal 2002 presentation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers temporary cash investments with original
maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash
equivalents.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable.
Receivables arising from sales to customers are not collateralized and, as a
result, management continually monitors the financial condition of its customers
to reduce the risk of loss. The Company five largest customers accounted for
87%, 82% and 104% of the Company revenues for Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001 and
Fiscal 2000, respectively. The Company single largest customer accounted for
36%, 22% and 27% of revenues for Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000,
respectively.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost
determined on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis and consist primarily of
products held for sale. Inventory manufactured by the Company includes the cost
of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost. Additions and improvements
are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation
of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The estimated useful lives
range from 25 to 40 years for buildings and their components and 3 to 15 years
for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Property and equipment leased under
capital leases is amortized over the lesser of its useful life or its lease
terms. Gains and losses on the disposition of property and equipment are
computed based upon the difference between the sales proceeds received and the
net book value of the fixed asset at the date of the disposal.
Goodwill
As a result of the many purchase business combinations completed by
Workflow since its inception, a substantial portion of the Company total
assets is represented by goodwill, which totaled $128,232 at April 30, 2002.
During Fiscal 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, was issued. Workflow adopted this new
standard and as a result, the Company ceased to amortize goodwill effective May
1, 2001. In lieu of amortization, during the first half of Fiscal 2002 Workflow
performed an initial impairment review of its goodwill as of the implementation
date, following which the Company concluded that there was no impairment of
goodwill at May 1, 2001. Workflow recently completed the required annual ongoing
impairment review of its goodwill at April 30, 2002. Consistent with the
Company initial test, no impairment of recorded goodwill was required as a
result of this analysis. Workflow intends to perform an impairment review upon
the completion of each fiscal year. The results of these annual impairment
reviews are highly dependent on management projection of future results for
Workflow reporting units and there can be no assurance that at the time such
reviews are completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded.

Earn-Out Agreements
Several of the acquisition agreements for the Company business
combinations accounted for under the purchase method of accounting include
earn-out provisions that could result in additional purchase consideration
payable in the form of cash payments in subsequent periods dependent upon
specific future operating performance criteria. The Company records additional
purchase consideration under these earn-out provisions in accordance with SFAS
No. 141, Business Combinations. As such, when the outcome of the contingency
under the earn-out is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt, the Company
records the expected earn-out payment as goodwill and accrues the earn-out as an
accrued liability on the Company balance sheet.
Translation of Foreign Currencies
The financial statements include the results of the Company Canadian
operations which are translated from Canadian dollars, their functional
currency, into U.S. dollars. Balance sheet accounts of foreign subsidiaries are
translated using the year-end exchange rate and the statement of income accounts
are translated using the average prevailing exchange rate during the year.
Translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders' equity as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Foreign currency transaction
gains and losses are recorded in income when realized.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Company financial instruments including
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate
fair value. The face amounts of the Company credit facility, subordinated debt
and other long-term debt, approximate their fair values.
Income Taxes
The Company provides for deferred taxes on temporary differences
arising from assets and liabilities whose bases are different for financial
reporting and state, federal and foreign income tax purposes. A valuation
allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than
not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
Taxes on Undistributed Earnings
No provision is made for U.S. income taxes on earnings of the Company
Canadian subsidiary company which the Company controls but does not include in
the consolidated federal income tax return since it is management practice and
intent to permanently reinvest the earnings of this subsidiary. Upon
distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the
Company would be subject to both U.S. income taxes subject to an adjustment for
foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the foreign country.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when title of goods and risk of loss passes to
the buyer or upon completion of services provided to the customer. Returns of
the Company product are not considered material. Delivery costs billed to
customers are recognized in revenues.

Cost of Revenues
Vendor rebates are recognized on an accrual basis in the period earned
and are recorded as a reduction to cost of revenues. All delivery and warehouse
occupancy costs are included in cost of revenues.
Advertising Costs
The Company expenses advertising costs when the advertisement occurs.
Advertising costs are included in the consolidated statement of income as a
component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising expense
for Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000 was $196, $564 and $1,221,
respectively.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are charged to operations in the year
incurred. Research and development costs are included in the consolidated
statement of income as a component of selling, general and administrative
expenses.
Internally Developed Software
Internal costs related to internally developed software such as
internal salaries and supplies are expensed as incurred as a component of
selling, general and administrative expenses until the internally developed
software reaches its technological feasibility. External costs related to
internally developed software, such as outside programmers and consultants, are
capitalized as property and equipment and expensed over the expected useful life
of the software, normally three to five years. During Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001
and Fiscal 2000, the Company capitalized $1,391, $621 and $234, respectively, in
internal salaries and outside consulting fees for internally developed software.
Restructuring Costs
The Company records the costs of consolidating acquired operations into
existing Company facilities, including the external costs and liabilities to
close redundant Company facilities and severance and relocation costs related to
the Company employees in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.

New Accounting Pronouncements
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. In June
1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended by
SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities, in June 2000 SFAS No. 133 as Amended, effective for the
Company fiscal year beginning May 1, 2001. This standard requires companies to
record all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet,
measured at fair value. The recognition of gains or losses resulting from
changes in the values of those derivative instruments is based on the use of
each derivative instrument and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. The
key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be
highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows.
Effective May 1, 2001, Workflow implemented SFAS No. 133 as amended. The
adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on the Company
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Business Combinations and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In July
2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations and No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires that business
combinations initiated subsequent to June 30, 2001, must be accounted for by
using the purchase method of accounting. SFAS No. 142 supersedes Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No. 17, Intangible Assets, however, the new
statement carries forward provisions in APB Opinion No. 17 related to internally
developed intangible assets. SFAS No. 142 requires that the Company discontinue
the amortization of goodwill. Early adoption of SFAS No. 142 was allowed for
those companies with fiscal years beginning after March 15, 2001. Workflow
adopted and applied SFAS No. 142 as of May 1, 2001, the beginning of Fiscal
2002. SFAS No. 142 further requires companies to test goodwill and other
indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis for impairment.
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. In
August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which supersedes both SFAS No. 121 and the
accounting and reporting provisions of APB No. 30, for the disposal of a
business. SFAS 144 provides a single accounting model for long-lived assets to
be disposed of. Although retaining many of the fundamental recognition and
measurement provisions of SFAS 121, the new rules change the criteria to be met
to classify an asset as held-for-sale. The new rules also broaden the criteria
regarding classification of a discontinued operation. Workflow was required to
adopt the provisions of SFAS 144 effective May 1, 2002. Workflow believes that
the adoption of SFAS 144 will not have a material impact on its results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.
Extinguishment of Debt and Accounting for Leases. In April 2002, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64,
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections, that supercedes
previous guidance for the reporting of gains and losses from extinguishment of
debt and accounting for leases, among other things.
SFAS No. 145 requires that only gains and losses from the
extinguishment of debt that meet the requirements for classification as
Extraordinary Items, as prescribed in APB No. 30, should be disclosed as such
in the financial statements. Previous guidance required all gains and losses
from the extinguishment of debt to be classified as Extraordinary Items. This
portion of SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15,
2002, with restatement of prior periods required. Implementation of this portion
of the standard will result in the reclassification of certain losses on
extinguishment of debt previously treated as extraordinary items by Workflow.
In addition, SFAS No. 145 amends SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases,
as it relates to accounting by a lessee for certain lease modifications. Under
SFAS No. 13, if a capital lease is modified in such a way that the change gives
rise to a new agreement classified as an operating lease, the assets and
obligation are removed, a gain or loss is recognized and the new lease is
accounted for as an operating lease. Under SFAS No. 145, capital leases that are
modified so the resulting lease agreement is classified as an operating lease
are to be accounted for under he sale-leaseback provisions of SFAS No. 98,
Accounting or Leases. These provisions of SFAS No. 145 are effective for
transactions occurring after May 15, 2002.
SFAS No. 145 will be applied as required. Adoption of SFAS No. 145 is
not expected to have a material impact on the Company results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.

NOTE 4--BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
During Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000, the Company made two,
eight and six acquisitions, respectively, accounted for under the purchase
method the Purchased Companies. The results of these acquisitions have been
included in the Company results from their respective dates of acquisition.
Initial cash consideration and subsequent acquisition costs paid associated with
the acquisition of the Purchased Companies totaled $19,561, $32,898 and $36,470
during Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000, respectively. A note payable of
$10,337 was issued in conjunction with one of the Purchased Companies during
Fiscal 2000. The total assets acquired with the Purchased Companies during
Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000, were $20,145, $42,340 and $61,912,
respectively, including intangible assets of $18,531, $23,191 and $23,244,
respectively.
The majority of the Purchased Companies have earn-out provisions that
could result in additional purchase consideration payable in subsequent periods,
ranging from three to five years, dependent upon the future earnings of these
acquired companies. During Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000, $10,260 7,698 and $4,643, respectively, of additional purchase consideration was paid
by the Company in connection with earn-out provisions and another $8,525 has
been accrued for these earn-out provisions at April 30, 2002. The additional
consideration, whether paid or accrued, has been reflected in the accompanying
balance sheet as goodwill at April 30, 2002.
The following presents the unaudited pro forma results of operations of
the Company for Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, as if the purchase acquisitions
completed since the beginning of Fiscal 2001 had been consummated at the
beginning of Fiscal 2001. The Fiscal 2000 column reflects purchase acquisitions
completed during Fiscal 2000 and Fiscal 2001, as well as the sale of a small

the future. Fiscal 2001 and 2000 data assume $3,116 and $2,587, respectively, of
goodwill amortization. Excluding such amortization, pro forma net income and
basic and diluted net income per share would have been $6,370, $049 and $049,
respectively, for Fiscal 2001, and $26,292, $207 and $189, respectively, for
Fiscal 2000. The Fiscal 2001 data reflects restructuring and abandoned public
offering costs of $8,292 and $1,677, respectively. The Fiscal 2000 data reflects
restructuring costs of $1,467 and a gain on sale of securities of $15,826.

NOTE 5--RESTRUCTURING COSTS
During Fiscal 2001, the Company incurred expenses of $8,292 in
connection with its' reorganization and integration plan. Under this
restructuring plan, the Company streamlined its operations by eliminating
duplicate facilities and employee functions and reducing corporate overhead. The
Company paid $1,331 and $681 for severance and utilized an additional $1,682 and
$4,025 for facility closures and asset write-downs associated with this plan in
Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, respectively.
During Fiscal 2000, the Company incurred expenses of $1,467, at its'
Canadian subsidiary, associated with the reorganization of certain executive and
administrative functions and the closure of one of the Canadian manufacturing
facilities. As a result of the restructuring plan, the Company paid $1,316 and
$151 in Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000, respectively, for severance agreements,
facility closures and various other fees associated with this plan.
Under the restructuring plans implemented during Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal
2000, the Company intended to terminate and provide severance benefits to 100
and 39 employees, respectively. During Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000,
the Company terminated and provided severance benefits to 100, 31 and 9
employees, respectively. By the end of Fiscal 2002, the Company had terminated
all employees it intends to terminate under the restructuring plans. However,
certain severed employees have delayed severance payments. The majority of the
workforce reductions were within the production area and backroom functions such
as accounting, human resources and administration.

In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations and
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires that
business combinations initiated subsequent to June 30, 2001, must be accounted
for by using the purchase method of accounting. SFAS No. 142 supersedes
Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 17, Intangible Assets,
however, the new statement carries forward provisions in APB Opinion No. 17
related to internally developed intangible assets. SFAS No. 142 requires that
the Company discontinue the amortization of goodwill. Early adoption of SFAS No.

Total short-term debt     $  157,843  $  994
The Company has entered into a secured revolving credit facility with
$183,750 available, subject to certain leverage tests, for working capital and
acquisition purposes, including a $134,750 revolver and a $49,000 amortizing
term note. The existing credit facility is secured by substantially all of the
Company assets and is subject to terms and conditions typical of a credit
facility of such type and size, including certain financial covenants. At April
30, 2002, the Company had $157,150 outstanding under the credit facility, at an
annual interest rate of approximately 78%. The credit facility matures on March
10, 2004. During Fiscal 2002, the Company incurred $11,337 in interest expense
relating to the credit facility.
During the quarter ended April 30, 2002, the Company breached a leverage
covenant in the credit facility. However, the Company lenders waived the
default Waiver under the leverage covenant, allowing the Company to be in
compliance with the credit facility as of April 30, 2002, and the Company agreed
to amendments to certain provisions of the credit facility. Under the terms of
the Waiver, i the leverage ratio from April 30, 2002 through July 30, 2002 was
increased to 415 to 10, ii on July 31, 2002 and thereafter the leverage
ratio will be 375 to 10 and iii certain minimum cumulative consolidated
EBITDA requirements were imposed.
These amendments to the credit facility will allow the Company to pursue
alternative financing sources or otherwise generate cash to reduce borrowings
under the credit facility. If the Company is not able to procure alternative
financing or otherwise generate cash to significantly reduce borrowings under
the credit facility in the near future, then it has agreed in principle with the
lenders to enter into an amended credit facility. The agreement with the
Company lenders contemplates that the amended credit facility would bear
interest at 12%, mature on October 31, 2003 and provide access to working
capital based on a borrowing base formula. The amended credit facility would
also have financial covenants typical of asset based financing facilities. These
covenants, and other terms and conditions of the amended facility, would be
subject to negotiation with the lenders. Because the Company has not yet reached
agreement with its lenders regarding all of the specific terms and conditions
that would be contained in the amended credit facility, the existing credit
facility must be classified as short-term debt under accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
Consistent with the Company agreement with the lenders as described
above, it is currently pursuing alternative financing. The proceeds from any
such alternative financing would be used in large part to repay amounts
outstanding under the Company existing credit facility. The Company currently
anticipates that it will be able to obtain alternative financing, but it cannot
give any assurance as to when or whether this actually will occur.
The Company anticipates that any alternative financing would subject it
and its subsidiaries to material covenants that would restrict certain aspects
of the Company operations. The Company also anticipates that this financing
will be secured by substantially all of the Company and the Company domestic
subsidiaries' assets and guaranteed by the Company domestic subsidiaries.
Because of these restrictions, and because the amended credit facility
the Company anticipates entering into with its existing lenders if the Company
is not able to obtain alternative financing also will contain restrictive
covenants, the financing alternative the Company ultimately implements will
impose restrictions on its operations and these restrictions could adversely
affect the Company liquidity. Specifically, i the Company ability to
obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired; ii the Company
will be required to use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations
to pay interest on the Company indebtedness, which will reduce the funds
available to the Company for other purposes; and iii the Company level of
indebtedness will make the Company more vulnerable to economic downturns and
adverse developments in the Company business.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In Thousands, Except Per Share Data Interest Rate Swap
The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments
for trading purposes. On May 3, 2001, the Company entered into an interest rate
swap agreement the Swap with various lending institutions at no cost to the
Company with an effective date of August 1, 2001 and an expiration date of March
10, 2004. The Company exchanged its variable interest rate on $100,000 in Credit
Facility debt for a fixed LIBOR of approximately 510% plus the Company
interest rate spread under its Credit Facility. The Swap was entered into to
manage interest rate risk on the variable rate borrowings under the Company
revolving credit portion of its debt. This interest rate swap has the effect of
locking in, for a specified period, the base interest rate the Company will pay
on the $100,000 notional principal amount established in the Swap. As a result,
while this hedging arrangement is structured to reduce the Company exposure to
increases in interest rates, it also limits the benefit the Company might
otherwise have received from any decreases in interest rates.
The Company accounted for the Swap per the guidelines of SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Effective May 1,
2001, the Company has implemented SFAS No. 133 as amended. This standard
requires companies to record all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities
on the balance sheet, measured at fair value. The recognition of gains or losses
resulting from changes in the values of those derivative instruments is based on
the use of each derivative instrument and whether it qualifies for hedge
accounting. The key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging
relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair
value or cash flows. Per the guidelines of SFAS No. 133, the Company classified
the Swap as a cash flow hedge. This Swap is cash settled quarterly dependent
upon the movement of 3-month LIBOR rates. In measuring the fair value of the
Swap at April 30, 2002, the Company recorded a long-term liability of $3,666 and
a loss in other comprehensive income, net of taxes, of $2,126. The Company
recognized in earnings, as additional interest expense, $1,903 for Fiscal 2002,
for the change in the prevailing LIBOR rate compared to the fixed rate under the
Swap agreement.

Distribution
Under the terms of a stock distribution agreement entered into between
Workflow and U.S. Office Products in June 1998 when the Company was spun-off
from U.S. Office Products, it was obligated, subject to a maximum obligation
of $1,750, to indemnify U.S. Office Products for certain liabilities incurred by
U.S. Office Products prior to the spin-off, including liabilities under federal
securities laws. This indemnification obligation is reduced by any insurance
proceeds actually recovered in respect of the indemnification obligation and is
shared on a pro rata basis with the other three divisions of U.S. Office
Products which were spun-off from U.S. Office Products at the same time.
U.S. Office Products has been named a defendant in various class action
lawsuits. These lawsuits generally allege violations of federal securities laws
by U.S. Office Products and other named defendants during the months preceding
the spin-off. Workflow has not received any notice or claim from U.S. Office
Products alleging that these lawsuits are within the scope of the Workflow
indemnification obligation, but the Company believes that certain liabilities
and costs associated with these lawsuits, up to a maximum of $1,750 may to be
subject to Workflow indemnification obligation. On March 5, 2001, U.S. Office
Products and most of its United States subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions
for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company is not able to conclude that a claim by U.S. Office Products
against Workflow pursuant to the foregoing indemnification obligations is
probable because the decision to pursue that claim rests solely with the
creditors of U.S. Office Products that are parties to the bankruptcy proceeding.
Postemployment Benefits
The Company has entered into employment agreements with several employees
that would result in payments to these employees upon a change of control or
certain other events. No amounts have been accrued at April 30, 2002 related to
these agreements, as no change of control has occurred.
Other
The Company is, from time to time, a party to litigation arising in the
normal course of its business. Management believes that none of this litigation
will have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
operations or cash flows of the Company. NOTE 15--EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Basic income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income
available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted income reflects the potential dilution that
could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were
exercised or converted into common stock. The following information presents the
Company computations of basic and diluted income per share for the periods
presented in the consolidated statement of income                                              Fiscal Year Ended April 30,

The Company had additional employee stock options outstanding during the
periods presented that were not included in the computation of diluted income
per share because they were anti-dilutive. Options to purchase 4,613, 4,556 and
239 shares of common stock were anti-dilutive and outstanding during Fiscal
2002, Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000, respectively.
Notes Receivable for Stock Loans
During Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 1999, the Company extended loans to certain

individuals. The Stock Loans are unsecured, full recourse promissory notes
bearing interest at 675% and 80% per annum with principal and interest payable
at maturity on January 2, 2003. Upon a change of control of the Company, as
defined on the notes, the principal amount and accrued interest outstanding
under the Stock Loans is forgiven. At April 30, 2002, $4,820 and $704 in

Prior to the Distribution, certain employees of the Company
participated in the U.S. Office Products 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan USOP
Plan covering employees of U.S. Office Products. Upon the Distribution, the
Company replaced the options to purchase shares of U.S. Office Products common
stock held by its employees with options to purchase shares of common stock of
the Company. In order to keep the Company employees that were option holders in
the USOP Plan in the same economic position immediately before and after the
Distribution, the number of U.S. Office Products' options held by Company
personnel was multiplied by 1556 and the exercise price of those options was
divided by 1556 for purposes of the replacement options. The vesting provisions
and option period of the original grants were not changed.
U.S. Office Products, as the sole stockholder of the Company prior to
the Distribution, approved the provisions of the Company 1998 Stock Incentive

of the Company common stock immediately following the Distribution, which
equals 4,393 shares, including the issuance of 600 shares of incentive stock

granted to Jonathan J. Ledecky, Thomas B. D'Agostino, Sr., executive officers
and non-employee directors described below. All employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries, as well as non-employee directors and consultants of the Company,
are eligible for awards under the Plan. Non-qualified stock options and
incentive stock options granted to employees generally are exercisable beginning
one year from the date of grant in cumulative yearly amounts for periods ranging
from one to four years and generally expire ten years from the date of the
grant. The Company Board of Directors adopted the Plan prior to the
