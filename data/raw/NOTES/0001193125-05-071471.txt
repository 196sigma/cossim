REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of iGate Corporation:  We were engaged to perform an integrated audit of iGate Corporations 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. We have audited the Companys 2004, 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, based on our audits of those consolidated financial statements, is presented below. However, as explained more fully below, the scope of our work was not sufficient to enable us
to express, and we do not express, an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004.  Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under  a1 present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of iGate Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under a2 presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  Internal
control over financial reporting  The Company has not
reported on its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, the scope of our work was not sufficient to enable us to express, and we do not express, an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting.  A material weakness
is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Although management has not
reported on its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, management has identified the following material weaknesses as of December 31, 2004.  Management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2004, the Company did not
maintain effective controls over the accounting for customer accounts receivable and the corresponding revenue, the Company had ineffective controls over the application and monitoring of cash payments received from customers and the issuance of
customer credit memos and discounts. This deficiency resulted in an audit adjustment to the fourth quarter 2004 consolidated financial statements. Additionally, this control deficiency could result in a misstatement to customer accounts receivable
that could result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, management has concluded that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.
Also, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2004,
the Company did not maintain effective controls over the calculation and review of deferred compensation and the corresponding compensation 
39 Table of Contents
expense. Specifically, the Companys controls did not identify a computational error in determining the amount of compensation expense to be recognized
from the cancellation of 21 million shares of restricted stock and the related cash payments made to the Quintant Inc. founders. This deficiency resulted in an audit adjustment to the fourth quarter 2004 consolidated financial statements.
Additionally, this deficiency could result in a misstatement to deferred compensation expense that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.
Accordingly, management has concluded that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.  The existence of one or more material weaknesses as of December 31, 2004 would preclude a conclusion that the Companys internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of that date. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2004 consolidated financial statements, and our disclaimer of
opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements.  PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP  Pittsburgh, PA April 6, 2005

iGATE CORPORATION  NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  AS OF DECEMBER 31,
2004 AND 2003 
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  a Nature of Business  iGate Corporation the Company is a worldwide provider of
information technology IT and Offshore Outsourcing services to large and medium-sized organizations.  b Principles of Consolidation  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company accounts for investments in businesses in which it owns between 20% and 50% of equity or otherwise acquires management influence using the equity method as prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. Investments in which the Company acquires less than a 20% interest, or in which the Company does not acquire management influence,
are accounted for using the cost method of accounting or, if publicly traded, as available-for-sale securities.  c Uses of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  d Reclassifications  Certain amounts in
previously issued financial statements were reclassified to conform to 2004 presentations. See Note 13 for further information.  e Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Cash equivalents are
stated at cost, which approximates market value.  f
Short-Term Investments  Short-term investments consist of
money market funds and corporate bonds and are stated at cost which approximates fair value.  g Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Receivables  The Company extends credit to clients based upon managements assessment of their creditworthiness. Substantially all of the Companys revenues and the resulting accounts receivable are from Fortune 500
companies, major systems integrators and governmental agencies.  Unbilled receivables represent amounts recognized as revenues for the periods presented based on services performed in accordance with the terms of client contracts that will be invoiced in subsequent periods. 
45 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003 
h Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts  Accounts receivables are reviewed periodically to determine the probability
of loss. The allowance for uncollectible accounts is determined using the combination of the specific identification method for balances deemed uncollectible, as well as judgments made by the Company based upon historical and expected charge-off
experience.  i Employee Advances  Employees can be advanced up to $2,500 at the discretion of the Company.
Normally, advances are based upon financial need at date of hire. Advances are deducted from the employees salary over a six-month period or until paid in full. 
j Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates  The Company accounts for its investments in marketable equity securities in accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities SFAS 115. The Company has determined that certain of its investments in marketable equity securities are classified as
available-for-sale and recorded at fair value, utilizing the investments closing price at each reporting period. These investments are recorded on the balance sheet at market value, with the unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, reported as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of Shareholders Equity and Comprehensive Loss. The unrealized gain or loss is the difference between the Companys original cost for an investment and the
investments fair value at each reporting period. Realized gains or losses on securities sold are calculated using the specific identification method.  If management determines that an investment in available for sale securities has sustained an other-than-temporary decline in its value, the investment is
written down to its fair value, by a charge to earnings. Such evaluation is dependent on the specific facts and circumstances. Factors that are considered by the Company in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred
include: the market value of the security in relation to its cost basis; the financial condition of the investee; and the intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the
investment.  In evaluating these factors above, management
presumes a decline in value to be other-than-temporary if the market price of the security is 20% or more below the investments cost basis for a period of six months or more the 20% criteria. However, the presumption of an
other-than-temporary decline in these instances may be overcome if there is persuasive evidence indicating that the decline is temporary in nature e.g., strong operating performance of investee, historical volatility of investee, etc.
Additionally, there may be instances where impairment losses are recognized even if the 20% criteria is not satisfied e.g., plan to sell the security in the near term and the fair value is below the Companys cost basis. During 2003 and 2002,
the Company incurred impairment losses deemed to be other-than-temporary. These impairments are disclosed in Note 6. No such impairment losses were incurred in 2004.  For investments accounted for using the cost or equity method of accounting, management evaluates information e.g.,
budgets, business plans, financial statements, etc. in addition to quoted market price, if any, in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value exists. Factors indicative of an other-than-temporary decline include recurring
operating losses, credit defaults and subsequent rounds of financings at an amount below the cost basis of an investment. This list is not all inclusive and management weighs all quantitative factors in determining if an other-than-temporary decline
in value of an investment has occurred.

k Land, Building, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements  Property and equipment are stated at cost. The Company provides for
depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Companys accounts and the resulting gains and losses are reflected in loss from
operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Improvement and betterments that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized.  The estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are as follows:  Building
25 years
Equipment
35 years
Leasehold Improvements
Shorter of the life of the improvement or lease term ranging from 3 to 10 years
l Goodwill and
Intangible Assets  Goodwill is the excess of purchase
price over the value of the net assets acquired. Under SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but will be subject to, at a minimum, an annual impairment
assessment of their carrying value. Under SFAS 142, goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Estimated fair values of reporting units underlying the segments were estimated
using either a discounted cash flow methodology, recent comparable transactions or a combination thereof. For further discussions, see Note 5.  The cost of other acquired intangibles is amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.  The estimated useful lives of intangible assets are as follows:  Intellectual property
35 years
Customer relationships
36 years
Beneficial employment contracts
4 years
The Company assesses
the carrying value of its long-lived assets, including land, building, equipment and leasehold improvement and amortizable intangible assets, whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may
not be recoverable. Long-lived assets are considered to be impaired when the sum of the undiscounted expected future net operating cash flows is less than the carrying values of the related assets.  m Income Taxes  Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the
financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Companys assets and liabilities. The Company has evaluated its deferred tax asset and has recorded a valuation allowance where appropriate. 
47 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003 
Historically, the government of India has provided incentives, in the form of tax holidays, to
encourage foreign investment. Under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961, the Companys Indian subsidiary is eligible to claim a tax holiday for 10 consecutive assessment years on profits derived from the export of software services from divisions
registered under the Software Technology Parks at Bangalore, Chennai and Pune. The benefits of the holiday will expire for certain of the units beginning in 2005.  The Company has not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding tax on basis differences in its non-U.S.
subsidiaries of $58 million that result primarily from undistributed earnings the Company intends to reinvest indefinitely. Determination of the deferred income tax liability on these basis differences is not practicable because such liability, if
any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.  n Minority Interest  Minority interest represents the proportionate share of outside equity holders. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had outside equity holders for the following Companies:  Percentage OutsideOwnership 2004 2003 iGate Global Solutions Ltd. iGS.

Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The
following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate that fair value:  Cash and short-term investmentsThe carrying amount approximates market value.  Accounts receivableThe carrying amount approximates market.
Revolving credit facilityThe carrying amount
approximates market value. The outstanding balance is reflected at its outstanding face value, excluding unpaid accrued interest at an interest rate at the lesser of the current LIBOR rate+125% or the Prime rate +025%, calculated on a per annum
basis.  Accounts payableThe carrying amount
approximates market. 
48 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003 
p Derivatives Instruments and Hedging Activities  The Company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging
currency, price, and interest rate exposures, which exist as part of ongoing business operations. The Company carries derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value, determined by reference to quoted market prices. Derivatives are
included in other assets and other liabilities based on the instruments fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of hedging relationship
and, if so, the reason for holding it. The cash flows related to derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within operating activities as a component of other items, net.  The Company recorded $01 million in other income in 2004 and $01 million in
other expense in 2002 related to its foreign currency hedging transactions. The Company had no derivative gains or losses in 2003.  At December 31, 2002, the Company liquidated its only foreign exchange contract for $60 million Canadian dollars at rate of 15738 or U.S. $38 million.
As a result of the sale, the Company realized a loss of $01 million in 2002.  q Stock-Based Employee Compensation  The Company has stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 11. SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, SFAS 123 gives companies the option to
adopt the fair value method for expense recognition of employee stock options or to continue to account for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method, as outlined under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees APB 25. The Company has elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value method to account for employee stock options and discloses the pro forma effect as if the fair value method had been applied.
The following table illustrates the effect on net loss per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation:  Year ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 in thousands, except per shareamounts Net Loss, as reported 18,211 9,020 27,491 Add: Deferred and other stock-based compensation expense reported in earnings 14,296 1,631 102 Less: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value method for all awards and deferred compensation

Translation Adjustment  For all significant foreign
operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Statement of Operations accounts are translated at the average exchange rate
prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of other comprehensive loss. Gain and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in
other expense income, net for the periods presented.  Foreign
exchange gains or losses on intercompany loans from the Company to its operating subsidiaries are recorded as a component of other income if payment is expected in the foreseeable future based upon mutually agreed upon payment terms.  s Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue on time-and-materials contracts as the
services are performed. Revenue is earned when the Company consultants are working on projects. Revenue recognition is negatively impacted by national holidays and consultant vacation and sick days. Revenues on fixed-price contracts are recognized
using the proportional performance method. Performance is determined by relating the actual cost of work performed to date to the estimated total cost for each contract and revenue is recognized based upon costs incurred by the Companys
consultants during the period. If the estimate indicates a loss on a particular fixed-price contract, a provision is made for the entire estimated loss without reference to the stage of completion. Changes in job performance, conditions and
estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are 
50 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003 
recognized in the period in which the changes are identified. Contracts with deliverables or project milestones recognize revenue as the deliverables or
project milestones are achieved. Contracts with deliverables or project milestones can provide for certain penalties if the deliverables or project milestones are not met within contract timelines. Certain maintenance type contracts with no stated
deliverables, with a designated workforce assigned, recognize revenues on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, which are typically one year in duration. Revenue on these contracts is ratable and predetermined based upon the
negotiated contract.  In certain client situations, where the
nature of the engagement requires it, we utilize the services of other companies in our industry. If these services are provided under an arrangement whereby we agree to retain only a fixed portion of the amount billed to the client to cover our
management and administrative costs, we classify the amount billed to the client as subcontractor revenue. These revenues, however, are recorded on a gross versus net basis because we retain credit risk and are the primary obligor to our client. All
revenue derived from services provided by our employees or other independent contractors who work directly for us are recorded as direct revenue.  t Software Implementation Costs  The Company accounts for costs incurred for its own information systems upgrades in accordance with Statement of Position 98-1 SOP 98-1
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. SOP 98-1 requires that both internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage should be charged to operations as
incurred. Such costs incurred during the application developement stage should be capitalized; training costs incurred in this stage should, however, be expensed. Costs of upgrades and enhancements should be capitalized but only during the
application development stage if it is probable that the expenditures will result in added functionality for the software. During the post-implementation/operation stage, training costs both internal and external and maintenance costs should be
charged to operations.  u Gains on Issuance of Stock by
Subsidiaries  At the time a subsidiary sells its stock to
unrelated parties at a price in excess of its book value, the Companys investment in that subsidiarys net assets increases. If at that time, the subsidiary is not a newly- formed, non-operating entity, nor a research and development,
start-up, or development-stage company, nor is there a question as to the subsidiarys ability to continue in existence, the Company records the increase as a gain in its Consolidated Statement of Operations.  v Acquisitions  The Companys acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method.
The purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair market values. Any excess purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. For all
acquisitions, operating results are included in the Consolidated Statement of Loss since the dates of the acquisitions. See Note 12 for additional information. 
w Discontinued Operations  The Company adopted SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, SFAS 144 effective January 1,
2002. This standard establishes accounting and reporting requirements for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. The Company applied the provisions of SFAS 144 related to the sale of its Australian Australia and Direct
Resources International DRI subsidiaries in 2004. 
51 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003 
Managements plan to divest and the divestures both occurred within the same period for
reporting purposes. Australia and DRI were classified in the Consolidated Financial Statements as discontinued operations. The balance sheet amounts and statement results were reclassified to discontinued operations for both the Balance Sheet and
Statement of Operations presentation. The discontinued operations on the Statement of Operations were reported, net of applicable statutory taxes and net of gains on the sales of Australia and DRI. Additionally, segment information does not include
the results of businesses classified as discontinued operations. The Companys management does not expect any continuing involvement with these businesses following the sales.  x Net Loss per Share  The Company calculates net loss per share based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Because the Company was in a loss position,
it did not include any stock options outstanding whose exercise price were below the average market price or the effect of a convertible promissory note Note 15 as their effect would be considered antidulitive.  y Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued FASB No. 123 R, Share-based Payment. FASB No. 123 R requires employers to value share-based payments using the fair value method, eliminating the option to use the intrinsic method to value such payments. FASB
No. 123 R is effective for the third quarter of 2005. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the provision of this statement on its Consolidated Financial Statements.  In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities. FIN 46 requires unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse the risk and rewards of ownership among their owners and other parties involved.
The provisions of FIN 46 are effective immediately to all variable entities created after January 1, 2003 and variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest in after that date. For variable interest entities created before
this date, the provisions are effective July 31, 2003. On October 8, 2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 46-e, which allows public entities, who meet certain criteria, to defer the effective date for applying the provisions of FIN No. 46
to interests held by the public entity in certain variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities until the end of the first interim or annual period ending after December 15, 2003. On December 24, 2003, the FASB extended the
effective date to periods ending after March 15, 2004. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Financial Accounting Standards FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP No. 109-2, Application
of FASB No. 109, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provisions with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 in December 2004. FSP 109-2 addresses the appropriate point at which a company should reflect in its
financial statements the effect of the one-time tax benefit on the repatriation of foreign earnings. We have decided not to repatriate earnings under the Act. 
2.Restricted Cash and Investments  The Company has short-term investments consisting of money market funds and corporate bonds that totaled $359 million and $396 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. Approximately $109million and $146 million of these funds at December 31, 2004 and 2003 are to be used exclusively by iGS due to Indian governmental restrictions. 
52 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003

the value of the securities. In addition, the Companys investments in Ordercare, Inc. Ordercare, Bluewater Information Convergence, Inc. Bluewater, Brainbench, Inc. Brainbench, Xpede, Inc.
Xpede and Escend Technologies, Inc. Escend have been impaired in prior periods to reflect the Companys belief that no return on capital will be realized. On August 19, 2002, itiliti sold its assets and liabilities to Peopleclick, Inc. Peopleclick for approximately 3% of Peopleclicks outstanding common stock. The
Company has a $0 basis in its itiliti shares and has continued to assign a $0 basis to its investment in itiliti. Prior to the August 2002 sale of Peopleclick, the Company owned 49% of itiliti. 1

Investments and Affiliated Companies  In 2002, the United
States economy had experienced a broad decline in the public equity markets, particularly in technology stocks, including investments held in the Companys investment portfolio. Similarly, the Company experienced a significant decline in value
of its privately held investment in Air2Web. As a result, the Company recorded noncash pretax charges to reduce the carrying value of its Speechworks investment by approximately $06 million and its Air2Web investment by approximately $68 million
in the fourth quarter of 2002. These investments experienced other-than-temporary declines using the criteria discussed in Note 1. In 2002, the Company sold its shares in Versata stock at a loss of $02 million.  In 2003, management evaluated its available-for-sale investment portfolio and
determined that no other-than-temporary decline existed under guidelines discussed in Note 1, and accordingly, no other-than-temporary losses were recorded. Management evaluated its investment in Air2Web and using guidelines previously discussed in
Note 1, recorded a $03 million charge to reduce the carrying value in Air2Web. In 2003, the Company sold the remaining investment it held in Red Hat, Inc., recognizing a gain of $03 million. No additional impairment charges against the
Companys investments in unconsolidated affiliates were recorded in 2004.

Gain on Deconsolidation of Subsidiary  On March 15, 2002, through the combination of a sale of new shares by itiliti to strategic investors and conversion of its bridge loan financing vehicle
to voting equity securities, the Companys ownership interest in itiliti was reduced from 90% to 49%. Subsequent to the transaction date, the Company accounted for its interest in itiliti under the equity method of accounting due to its lack of
a controlling interest in itiliti. In addition, the Company will have no future obligation to fund additional operating or financing requirements of itiliti. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a gain on deconsolidation of
$71 million.  Components of Other Comprehensive Loss on

6.Restructuring, Merger and Goodwill Impairment Charges  In 2004, the Company restructured its Canadian and United Kingdom operations. The Company incurred $09 million of early exit costs associated with its
Toronto, Canada office. The Company incurred approximately $49 million related to the closing of its Red Brigade Ltd. office in Bracknell, UK, which was comprised of $46million of early exit costs associated with the closing and $03 million
of non cash charges related to write-offs of leasehold improvements associated with the leased property. As part of the restructuring six employees were eliminated. These employees were executive level, administrative and back office support.
56 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003 
In 2003, the Company recorded $01 million in severance related costs associated with the offshore
outsourcing of certain of its back office finance and accounting functions at iGate Corporate. The 13 employees who were severed ranged from clerical to middle management. These costs were recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 146.  The following paragraphs discuss the Companys restructurings of its
business. All costs associated with restructurings occurring in 2002 and 2001 were accounted for in accordance with EITF 94-3, Liability Recognition for Costs to Exit an Activity.  During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company incurred $42 million of costs associated with a restructuring of certain of
its business units as well as departments within the iGate corporate structure. The restructuring was due in part to iGSs agreed upon purchase of eJivas stock, to align the Companys business units to increase focus on global
offshore delivery and to consolidate the Companys back office operations. The back office consolidation of operations included legal, accounting, marketing and human resource departments. As part of the restructuring, the Company vacated all
non-essential properties and all remaining employees were relocated to a centralized location. As part of the restructuring, the Company eliminated 96 U.S. positions. These employees were executive level, back office support and administrative
positions that were no longer being utilized. These actions were necessary due to the streamlining of the Companys back office operations and due to redundancies of effort. Of the total costs incurred as part of the restructuring, non-cash
charges totaling $08million were related to write-offs of leasehold improvements on abandoned leased property. In 2003, the Company adjusted its original estimate of restructuring reserves, recognizing additional costs of $05 million related
to rent expense due to the Companys inability to sub-lease its excess space.  In the third quarter of 2001, the continued economic downturn caused the Company to do an extensive review of its operations and certain overhead costs associated with each reportable segment. In August 2001, the
Company approved a restructuring plan the plan. Based upon its revenue trends and the general economic environment, the Company decided to put a plan in place that would serve to cut excess costs in certain of the operating segments.
As part of this plan, the Company recorded severance costs in the amount of $10 million. The Company reduced employee headcount by 84. These employees ranged from executive level through administrative assistants, and affected the iGate Solutions,
iGate Professional Services and iGate Corporate segments. The Company also recorded a $24 million charge for a bonus for one of its key executives. The Company also performed an extensive fixed asset inventory in each reportable segment, in order
to identify any fixed assets, such as laptops and computer equipment that were deemed to be in excess due to the headcount reduction. Based upon the fixed asset inventory, the Company recorded write-downs of $21 million. These write-downs of excess
equipment were recorded in the iGate Solutions, iGate Professional Services and iGate Corporate segments. The Company also decided to exit its training function at the iGate Corporate level in favor of a more decentralized approach. Exit costs
associated with the training department were $08 million and consisted of education-related licensing agreements entered into that would no longer be utilized. In the iGate Professional Services segment, the Company recorded a charge of $13
million for lease costs associated with the closure of its office in San Francisco. The Companys total charge for the plan totaled $76 million. These steps were necessary due to declines in demand and overall headcount.  In December 2001, the Company severed 3 employees of its wholly owned
subsidiary Global Financial Services of Nevada, ranging from executive level to general and administrative support and incurred a charge of $02 million. In December 2001, Innovative Resource Group, Inc. IRG, a majority-owned
subsidiary of the Company, merged with and into eJiva. As part of the merger, eJiva incurred $14 million of merger related exit costs associated with a leased space in Pittsburgh, PA. The merged eJiva entity relocated to IRG office space.

As discussed in Note 1 on January 1, 2002, the Company
adopted SFAS 142, which requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill and certain intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. Instead, SFAS 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life be reviewed
for impairment upon adoption of SFAS 142 and, at a minimum, annually thereafter. 
58 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003 
Under SFAS 142, goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit
exceeds its estimated fair value. Other than the allocation of goodwill, which is discussed below, the net book value of each of the Companys segments was generally based upon its carrying value. The Companys reporting units are
generally consistent with the operating segments underlying the segments identified in Note 16. The Company performed a transitional impairment review during the first quarter of 2002, and concluded that no impairment was necessary.  During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company reviewed its indefinite lived
goodwill for impairment, using a discounted cash model to determine the market value of certain reporting units with assigned goodwill. Based upon the review, the Company was required to record impairment charges of $39 million related to its
discontinued Australian operations.  During the fourth quarter
of 2002, the Companys majority owned Indian subsidiary, iGS agreed to purchase its sister company, eJiva. The purchase consideration was $95 million. As part of Indian regulatory requirements, iGS was required to engage a third party to
perform an independent valuation of eJiva in order to determine the purchase price consideration. The results of the valuation indicated that eJivas fair value was less than its carrying value. Due to this circumstance and in light of the
continued economic downturn, the Company assessed its intangible assets for impairment in each one of its reporting units. As a result of the assessment of its reporting units, the Company recorded a noncash charge of approximately $297 million to
reduce the carrying value of its goodwill. Goodwill was reduced by $243 million in the iGate Solutions segment and $17 million in the iGate Professional Services segment. An impairment charge of $260 million was recorded as a separate line item
in the Companys 2002 Consolidated Statements of Operations. Impairment charges in the amount of $37million related to the Companys Australian operations is included as part of discontinued operations. The charge reflects overall
market declines during 2002 in each of its operating segments.  7.Credit Facilities  On
September 16, 2004, the Company renewed its secured credit facility Renewed Facility with PNC Bank N.A. PNC. The Renewed Facility provides a maximum loan amount of $250 million and is secured entirely by the
Companys cash and cash equivalents. The provisions of the Renewed Facility requires the Company to maintain unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of at least $300 million and maintain tangible net worth of at least $880 million. The Company
had one letter of credit outstanding in the amount of $03 million on the Renewed Facility as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company did not file its Form 10-K by March 31, 2005. As a result, the Company violated an Affirmative
Covenant under the Renewed Facility that requires the Company to deliver audited financial statements to PNC. PNC has waived the default provision.

Convergys and Chubb Custom Insurance Group in May 2004.
Under the Settlement, the Company agreed to pay a total of $04 million to Convergys to settle and dismiss any and all claims. The actual out-of pocket cost to the Company was $01 million as all other amounts including attorneys fees were
reimbursed by our insurance carriers.  The Company is currently
involved in a lawsuit in Australia with Cytel Pty. Ltd. Cytel. Cytel is alleging certain consultants that were provided to Cytel were unqualified and incompetent. As a result, Cytels business reputation with their customer was
damaged and they failed to receive further projects from this customer. Cytel is seeking $38 million in damages. The Company has vehemently denied the accusations and considers the claim completely frivolous and merely an attempt to avoid paying
the Company less than $01 million for services previous rendered. The Company believes that the claim is covered by its insurance policies, and out-of pocket costs to the Company will be limited to its deductible, which is less than $01 million.

Company during 2004 and 2003. There were no acquisitions in 2002. Descriptions regarding each acquisition will vary dependent upon the complexity of the transaction and materiality and are presented in chronological order. Unless otherwise noted,
pro forma disclosure regarding these purchases have not been provided because they are not material to the operations of the Company.  The Company has calculated each purchase price allocation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business
Combinations. All purchase price allocations have been finalized at December 31, 2004. All amortizable intangible assets acquired consist of intellectual property, beneficial employment contracts and customer relationships. Please refer to Note

65 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003 
agreement with the founders and principal shareholders of Quintant Modified Quintant Transaction Structure. The principal reasons that the
Quintant acquisition structure was modified were a to have the Quintant co-founders more closely aligned to the stock value of iGS, rather than the Companys common stock, and b to simplify the ownership structure of Quintant whereby
Quintant will be owned 100% by iGS, rather than the original ownership structure where Quintant was jointly owned by iGS and iGate.  Under the terms of the Modified Quintant Transaction Structure, the Company was required to accelerate compensation expense, which is more fully discussed
in Note 11, and to pay the Quintant Co-Founders an additional $39 million in cash consisting of $32 million paid to Quintants Indian Co-Founder and $07 million paid in aggregate to the four Quintant Co-Founders. The costs associated with
the Modified Quintant Transaction Structure did not affect the Companys original purchase price allocation, which is discussed below.  All costs incurred as part of the Modified Quintant Transaction Structure were recorded as compensation expense in the period incurred and are included in

ownership to approximately 10%.  In February 2004, iGS acquired
92% of Saint Life for approximately $05 million. iGS acquired Saint Life primarily for the land that it owns that is adjacent to the iGS Whitefield Campus in Bangalore, India.  On October 20, 2003, iGS acquired the assets of IdeaSpace Solutions Ltd. IdeaSpace through its wholly owned
subsidiary ITT Technologies Services, Ltd. for approximately $15 million. IdeaSpace specializes in bank technology and operations. The purchase price allocation resulted in non-deductible goodwill of $03 million, which was assigned to the
iGate Solutions segment, and $11 million of intangible assets with a weighted average useful life of 24 years. The acquisition was effective December 10, 2003.  In September 2003, iGate Inc. acquired a 95% interest in DiagnoSearch for $15 million. DiagnoSearch is an Indian based
clinical research company. The purchase price allocation resulted in non-deductible goodwill of $05 million, which was assigned to the iGate Corporate segment, and $09 million of intangible assets with a weighted average useful life of 12 years.

15.Earnings per Share  The reconciliation between basic and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations is as follows: Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 in thousands, except per share data Basic loss per share Loss from continuing operations 22,029 5,618 24,199 Divided by Weighted average common shares 52,721 51,697 51,304 Basic loss per share from continuing operations 042 011 047 Diluted loss per share Loss from continuing operations 22,029 5,618 24,199 Divided by Weighted average common shares 52,721 51,697 51,304 Diluted loss per share from continuing operations 042 011 047  The number of
outstanding options to purchase common shares for which the option exercise prices exceeded the average market price of the common shares aggregated 13 million, 15 million and 20 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. These options were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share under the treasury stock method.  In addition, the calculation of diluted earnings per share for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, would have included 04 million, 04 million and 03
million shares for assumed exercise of options under the Companys share incentive plans, and 05 million shares during 2002 for the vested portion of the G.E. Note. However, because the Company was in a net loss position inclusion of such
shares would have been anti-dilutive.  16.Segment
Reporting  The Companys reportable segments are
iGate Solutions, iGate Professional Services and iGate Corporate. No operating segments have been aggregated. Effective April 1, 2004, we recast our segments to include the operations of Global Financial Services GFS as part of the
iGate Professional Services IPS segment. Previously, GFS was included in the iGate Solutions segment. All prior periods have been reclassified to reflect the change to our segment reporting. The following discussion also compares our
operating segments without the operations of iGate Australia Pty Ltd. and Direct Resources Ltd., which are being treated as discontinued operations. Prior to their sale in 2004 both entities were part of our IPS operating segment.  iGate Solutions  The iGate Solutions segments services offerings include offshore
outsourcing of IT services and IT systems maintenance. Other offerings include enterprise applications implementation and related custom development of applications such as Oracle, SAP and PeopleSoft. The Segment also offers application maintenance
outsourcing, business intelligence services and data management and application re-engineering through its offshore development centers ODCs. 
71 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003 
iGate Solutions has ODCs located in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Delhi, and Pune, India and Wuxi,
China. iGS has global development centers GDCs located in Canada and the U.S. The centers can deliver both near shore and offshore services, dependent upon customer location and expectations. iGate Solutions operates in India, Canada,

The IPS segment services the U.S., Canada, Australia and portions of the European market.  iGate Corporate  In 2004 and 2003, iGate Corporate includes the operations of jobcurry Systems Private Ltd., ICRI acquired on February 26, 2003 and DiagnoSearch acquired
October 28, 2003 and corporate and other unallocated costs. In 2002, iGate Corporate included itiliti, which was deconsolidated in March 2002, and MobileHelix, which ceased operations in February 2002.  The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1. We evaluate segment performance based upon profit or loss from operations. We do not allocate income taxes, other income or expense and non-recurring charges to segments. In addition, we
account for inter-segment sales and transfers at current market prices. All inter-segment sales have been eliminated in consolidation, which are not material. 
The following tables present selected financial information for the Companys reporting segments, as reclassified for discontinued operations, for

Corporate activities include general corporate expenses, interest income and expense, equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates, minority interest, loss from joint ventures and
restructuring charges not identified to a specific segment, and other unallocated charges. The Company evaluates segments based on income loss from operations. Since certain administrative and other operating expenses or income sources have not
been allocated to the operating business segments, this basis is not necessarily a measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and it may not be comparable to other companies.  Total assets by segment were as follows:  YearEndedDecember31 2004

17. Quarterly Financial Information Unaudited  The following table sets forth certain unaudited financial information for each of the quarters indicated below and, in the
opinion of management, contains all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, if necessary, for a fair presentation thereof. Earnings per share amounts for each quarter are required to be computed independently, and therefore may
not equal the amount computed for the entire year.

customers accounts receivable balances. These adjustments consisted of credits and discounts and were not related to prior reporting periods. In addition, an unfavorable adjustment in the amount of $13 million was recorded as compensation
expense as a result of the Quintant modification.

18. Related Party Transactions  In conjunction with the modified sales agreement with Quintant, which is more fully discussed in Notes 11 and 12, Phaneesh

The Company has advanced employees $14 million and $20
million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These advances do not exceed $2,500 per employee and are typically deducted from the employees salary over a six-month period or until paid in full.  At December 31, 2004, Sunil Wadhwani, CEO and Co-Founder of iGate
Corporation, directly owned 12,738,791 common shares of the Company and indirectly owned 2,562,262 common shares of the Company through various family trusts.

14 PART II Item 5.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the
Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with
the participation of Company management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 Exchange Act Rules 13a-15b and 15d-15b. Based upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective because of the material weaknesses discussed below. Due to these material weaknesses, the Company performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure that the consolidated financial statements were prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects the Companys financial position, results of operations and
cash flows for the periods presented.  Status of
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective because of changes in conditions
or that the degree of compliance with established policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Management is in the process of conducting an evaluation of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting,
management is using the criteria described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management has not yet completed its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. However, to date, management has identified certain control deficiencies which represent material weaknesses:  As of December 31, 2004, the Company did not maintain effective controls over the accounting for customer accounts receivable and the corresponding
revenue. Specifically, the Company had ineffective controls over the application and monitoring of cash payments received from customers and the issuance of customer credit memos and discounts. This deficiency resulted in an audit adjustment to the
fourth quarter 2004 consolidated financial statements. Additionally, this control deficiency could result in a misstatement to customer 
77 Table of Contents
accounts receivable and the corresponding revenue that could result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements
that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, management has concluded that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness; and  As of December 31, 2004, the Company did not maintain effective controls over the calculation and review of deferred compensation and the related
compensation expense. Specifically, the Companys controls did not identify a computational error in determining the amount of compensation expense to be recognized from the cancellation of 21 million shares of restricted stock and the related
cash payments made to the Quintant Inc. co-founders. This deficiency resulted in an audit adjustment to the fourth quarter 2004 consolidated financial statements. Additionally, this deficiency could result in a misstatement to deferred compensation
expense that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, management has concluded that this control deficiency constitutes a material
weakness.  The existence of one or more material weaknesses at
December 31, 2004 would preclude management from concluding that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004. Upon completion of our assessment, management expects to conclude that as of
December 31, 2004, the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financing reporting.  The Companys evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 is not complete. In connection with our ongoing
evaluation, we may identify additional control deficiencies and once we have completed our evaluation of all deficiencies we may determine that the deficiencies, either alone or in combination with others, constitute one or more additional
weaknesses.  We intend to file an amendment to this Form 10-K
to include i the report of management on internal control over financial reporting and the associated report of our independent registered public accounting firm as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and ii revised certifications
as required by Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Rule 13a-14a and Rule 15d-14a of the Securities Exchange Act, once we have completed our assessment of internal control over financial reporting.  Managements Remediation Efforts  The material weaknesses described above resulted in audit adjustments to the
fourth quarter 2004 consolidated financial statements of approximately $800,000 and $1,300,000, respectively. To address these material weaknesses, the Company performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure that the
consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects the
Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  There has been no change in iGates internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, such internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004.
