56 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Yahoo!Inc. We have completed
integrated audits of Yahoo!Inc.s 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial
statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2005 and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States. Our opinions, based on our
audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule
In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Yahoo!Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December31,
2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. In addition, in our opinion,
the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read
in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial
statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal control over financial reporting
Also, in our opinion, managements assessment,
included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based
on those criteria. Furthermore, in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the COSO.
The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control
over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial
reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for  57 external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers

Note1THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company. Yahoo!Inc.,
together with its consolidated subsidiaries Yahoo! or the Company, is a
leading global Internet brand and one of the most trafficked Internet
destinations worldwide. Yahoo! seeks to
provide Internet services that are essential and relevant to users and
businesses. To users, Yahoo! provides
its owned and operated online properties and services the Yahoo! Properties. To businesses, Yahoo! provides a range of
tools and marketing solutions designed to enable businesses to reach the Yahoo!
community of users.
Stock Split. On
April7, 2004, the Yahoo! Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split
of the Companys shares of common stock effected in the form of a stock
dividend. As a result of the stock
split, Yahoo! stockholders received one additional share of Yahoo! common stock
for each share of common stock held of record on April26, 2004. The additional shares of Yahoo! common stock
were distributed on May11, 2004. All
share and per share amounts in these consolidated financial statements and
related notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split for
all periods presented.
Basis of Presentation. The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Yahoo! and its
majority-owned or otherwise controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. Investments
in entities in which the Company can exercise significant influence, but does
not own a majority equity interest or otherwise control, are accounted for using
the equity method and are included as Investments in equity interests on the
consolidated balance sheets. The Company
has included the results of operations of acquired companies from the date of
acquisition.
Certain prior year amounts
have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The Company has changed the classification of
amortization expense related to developed technology and patents in the
consolidated statements of operations. This
amortization expense of $12million, $44million, and $64million
for 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively, was previously included as part of
operating expenses and has been reclassified to cost of revenues for all
periods presented.
The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States requires management to make
estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. On an
on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to
uncollectible receivables, the useful lives of long-lived assets including
property and equipment, investment fair values, goodwill and other intangible
assets, income taxes and contingencies. In
addition, the Company uses assumptions when employing the Black-Scholes
option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted for
pro forma disclosure purposes. The
Company bases its estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and
liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, when these carrying values
are not readily available from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Revenue Recognition. The
Companys revenues are derived principally from services, which comprise
marketing services for businesses and offerings to users. The Company classifies these revenues as
marketing services and fees.
The Company recognizes
revenue on arrangements in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 Revenue Recognition, SAB 104 and Financial
Accounting Standard Boards Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 00-21,
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. In all cases, revenue is recognized only when
the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, the service is performed and collectibility of the resulting receivable
is reasonably assured. In accordance
with EITF No. 01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
Customer or a Reseller of the Vendors Product, the Company  64 accounts for cash
consideration given to customers, for which it does not receive a separately
identifiable benefit or cannot reasonably estimate fair value, as a reduction
of revenue rather than as an expense.
Marketing services revenue
is generated from several offerings including: the display of rich media
advertisements, display of text based links to the advertisers website,
listing based services and commerce based transactions.
The Company recognizes
revenue related to the display of advertisements on the Yahoo! Properties as impressions
are delivered. An impression is
delivered when an advertisement appears in pagesviewed by users. Arrangements for these services generally
have terms of up to three years and in the majority of cases, the terms are
less than one year or may be terminated at any time by the advertiser. Some of these advertising agreements may
involve multiple element arrangements arrangements with more than one
deliverable.
The Company generates
revenue from the display of text based links to the websites of its advertisers
which are placed on the Yahoo! Properties as well as on the websites of third
party entities which the Company refers to as affiliates who have
integrated the Companys search offerings into their websites. The Company recognizes revenue from these
arrangements as click-throughs occur.
A click-through occurs when a user clicks on an advertisers
listing. The Company pays affiliates
based on click-throughs on the advertisers listings that are displayed
on the websites of these affiliates. These
payments are called traffic acquisition costs.
In accordance with EITF Issue No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross
as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, the revenue derived from these
arrangements that involve traffic supplied by affiliates is reported gross of
the payment to affiliates. This revenue
is reported gross due to the fact that the Company is the primary obligor to
the advertisers who are the customers of the advertising service.
Listings revenue is
generated from a variety of consumer and business listings-based
services, including access to Yahoo! HotJobs database and classifieds such as
Yahoo! Autos, Yahoo! Real Estate and other services. The Company recognizes listings revenue when
the services are performed.
Transaction revenue is
generated from facilitating commerce based transactions through the Yahoo!
Properties, principally from Yahoo!s commerce properties including Yahoo!
Travel and Yahoo! Shopping. The Company
recognizes transaction revenue when there is evidence that qualifying
transactions have occurred, for example, when travel arrangements are booked
through Yahoo! Travel.
Fees revenue consists of
revenues generated from a variety of consumer and business fee-based services,
including Internet broadband services, premium mail, music and personals
offerings as well as services for small businesses. The Company recognizes fees revenue when the
services are performed.
Current deferred revenue
primarily comprises contractual billings in excess of recognized revenue and
payments received in advance of revenue recognition. Long-term deferred revenue includes amounts
received from customers for which services will not be delivered within the
next 12 months. Long-term deferred
revenue also includes amounts that arose on the settlement of a litigation
dispute. See Note14Litigation
Settlement for additional information.
Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts. The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts
based upon its assessment of various factors.
The Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts
receivable balances, the credit quality of its customers, current economic
conditions and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay to
determine the level of allowance required.
Traffic Acquisition Costs. Traffic acquisition costs consist of
payments made to affiliates that have integrated the Companys search offerings
into their websites and payments made to companies that direct consumer and
business traffic to the Yahoo! Properties.
The Company enters into agreements of varying duration that involve
these traffic acquisition costs. There
are generally three economic structures of the affiliate agreements: fixed
payments based on a guaranteed minimum amount of traffic delivered, which  65 often carry reciprocal
performance guarantees from the affiliate; variable payments based on a
percentage of the Companys revenue or based on a certain metric, such as
number of searches or paid clicks; or a combination of the two. The Company expenses, as cost of revenues,
traffic acquisition costs associated with affiliate arrangements under two
different methods depending on the structure of the agreement. Agreements with fixed payments are expensed
ratably over the term the fixed payment covers.
Agreements based on a percentage of revenue, number of paid
introductions, number of searches, or other metrics are expensed based on the
volume of the underlying activity or revenue multiplied by the agreed-upon
price or rate.
Internal Use Software and
Website Development Costs. The Company has capitalized certain internal use software
and website development costs totaling approximately $11million 19million, and $18million during 2003, 2004, and 2005,
respectively. The estimated useful life
of costs capitalized is evaluated for each specific project and ranges from one
to three years. During 2003, 2004, and
2005, the amortization of capitalized costs totaled approximately
$9million, $11million, and $18million, respectively. Capitalized internal use software and website
development costs are included in property and equipment, net.
Product Development. Product development expenses consist
primarily of compensation related expenses incurred for enhancements to and
maintenance of the Yahoo! Properties, classification and organization of
listings within Yahoo! Properties, and research and development as well as
depreciation expense and other operating costs.
Advertising Costs. Advertising production costs are
recorded as expense the first time an advertisement appears. Costs of communicating advertising are
recorded as expense as advertising space or airtime is used. All other advertising costs are expensed as
incurred. Advertising expense totaled
approximately $115million, $160million, and $201 million for 2003,
2004, and 2005, respectively.
Stock-Based
Compensation. The Company measures compensation expense for its stock-based
employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method. This expense is generally being amortized
using the accelerated amortization method in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No. 28 Accounting for Stock
Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans. If the fair value based method had been
applied in measuring stock compensation expense, the pro forma effect on net
income and net income per share would have been as follows in thousands,
except per share amounts

The recorded stock
compensation expense relates to the amortization of the intrinsic value of
Yahoo! stock options issued and assumed in connection with business
combinations and other equity-based awards issued by the Company. 66 See Note12 Employee
Benefits for the assumptions and methodology used to determine the fair value
of stock-based compensation.
See Recent Accounting
Pronouncements below regarding the impact of the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123R SFAS123R, Share-Based
Payment.
Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes are determined
based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates
and laws. The provision for income taxes
comprises the Companys current tax liability and change in deferred income tax
assets and liabilities. A valuation
allowance is provided to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that,
based on available evidence, is more likely than not to be realized.
Comprehensive Income. Comprehensive
income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income
loss. Other comprehensive income
loss refers to gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting
principles are recorded as an element of stockholders equity but are excluded
from net income. The Companys other
comprehensive income loss is comprised of foreign currency translation
adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities
categorized as available-for-sale.
Cash and Cash Equivalents,
Short and Long-Term Investments. The Company
invests its excess cash in debt instruments of the United States Government and
its agencies and in high-quality corporate issuers which are classified as
marketable debt securities. All highly
liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are
considered cash equivalents. Investments
with effective maturities of less than 12 months from the balance sheet date
are classified as current assets. Investments
with effective maturities greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date
are classified as long-term assets.
The Companys marketable
debt and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are
reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded
in accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Realized gains or losses and declines in
value judged to be other than temporary, if any, on available-for-sale
securities are reported in other income, net.
The Company evaluates the investments periodically for possible other-than-temporary
impairment and reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which
fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and
the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which
may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value. The Company records impairment charges equal
to the amount that the carrying value of its available-for-sale securities
exceeds the estimated fair market value of the securities as of the evaluation
date, if appropriate. The fair value for
securities is determined based on quoted market prices as of the valuation date. In computing realized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities, the Company determines cost based on amounts
paid, including direct costs such as commissions, to acquire the security using
the specific identification method. During
the year ended December31, 2005, realized gains and losses on
available-for-sale debt securities were not material.
Investments in Equity
Interests. Investments in entities in which the
Company can exercise significant influence but does not own a majority equity
interest or otherwise control, are accounted for using the equity method and
included as Investments in equity interests on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company records its share of the results
of these companies one quarter in arrears within earnings in equity interests
on the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company monitors its investments
for other-than-temporary impairment
by considering factors including the stock price of public companies in which
it has an equity investment as well as current economic and market conditions
and the operating performance of the companies and records reductions in
carrying values when necessary. The fair
value of privately held investments is estimated using the best available
information as of the valuation date, including current earnings trends,
undiscounted cash flows, quoted stock prices of comparable public companies,
and other company specific information, including recent financing rounds. 67 The carrying amounts of
these investments are greater than the underlying equity in net assets of these
companies due in part to goodwill, which is not subject to amortization in
accordance with SFAS No. 142 SFAS 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. This goodwill is evaluated for
impairment in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for
Investments in Common Stock.
Concentration of Risk. Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration
of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt
securities and accounts receivable. As
of December31, 2005, substantially all of the Companys cash, cash
equivalents and investments were managed by six financial institutions. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured
and are derived from revenue earned from customers. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for potential credit
losses. Historically, such losses have
been within managements expectations. As
of December31, 2004 and 2005, no one customer accounted for
10percent or more of the accounts receivable balance and no one customer
accounted for 10 percent or more of the Companys revenues for 2003, 2004, or
2005.
Long-Lived Assets.
Property and Equipment. Buildings
are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of 25years.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their expected
useful life and the remaining lease term.
Computers and equipment and furniture and fixtures are stated at cost
and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the assets, generally two to five years.
The Company recognized depreciation expense on property and equipment of
approximately $105million, $165million and $224million for
2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively.
Goodwill. Goodwill
is carried at cost. Goodwill is not
amortized but is subject to an annual test for impairment at the reporting unit
level operating segment or one level below an operating segment and between
annual tests in certain circumstances. The
performance of the test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test
involves comparing the fair value of the Companys reporting units with the
reporting units carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company generally determines the fair
value of its reporting units using the expected present value of future cash
flows, giving consideration to the market valuation approach. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit
exceeds the reporting units fair value, the Company performs the second step
of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment
test involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill
with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill. Intangible
assets other than goodwill are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are generally amortized on
a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the respective assets, generally
two to seven years. Long-lived assets
and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on
an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the
asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement
of any impairment loss for long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the
amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.
Foreign Currency. The
functional currency of the Companys international subsidiaries is generally
the local currency. The financial
statements of these subsidiaries are translated into United States dollars
using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates
of exchange for the period for revenues and expenses. Translation gains losses are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a component of stockholders
equity. The Company recorded net foreign
currency transaction gains, realized and unrealized, of approximately
$3million and $6 million in 2003 and 2004,  68 respectively, and net
foreign currency transaction losses, realized and unrealized, of $8 million in
2005, which were included in other income, net.
Operating Leases. The
Company leases office space and data centers under operating lease agreements
with original lease periods up to 23 years.
Certain of the lease agreements contain rent holidays and rent
escalation provisions. Rent holidays and
rent escalation provisions are considered in determining straight-line rent
expense to be recorded over the lease term.
The lease term begins on the date of initial possession of the lease
property for purposes of recognizing lease expense on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease. Lease
renewal periods are considered on a lease-by-lease basis and are generally not
included in the initial lease term.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
In December2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires companies
to recognize in the statement of operations all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, based on their fair
values. Accounting for share-based
compensation transactions using the intrinsic method supplemented by pro forma
disclosures is no longer permissible. The
Company adopted the new requirements using the modified prospective method in
the first quarter of 2006. SFAS 123R
also requires excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options to be
presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing activity
rather than an operating activity, as currently presented.
For purposes of pro forma
disclosure of share-based compensation expense under APB Opinion No25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, the Company has applied the accelerated amortization method
outlined in FASB Interpretation No. 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation
Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans. Upon adoption of
SFAS 123R, the Company will continue to amortize stock compensation expense
related to options granted on or before December31, 2005 using the
accelerated method. For options and
other equity-based awards granted after December31, 2005, the Company
will amortize stock compensation expense using the straight-line method.
The Company expects the
adoption of SFAS 123R to result in stock compensation expense and therefore a
reduction of income before income taxes, earnings in equity interests and
minority interests in 2006 of approximately $420-$450 million. The Companys actual stock compensation
expense in 2006 could differ materially from this estimate depending on the
timing and magnitude of new awards, the number and mix of new awards, changes
in the market price or the volatility of the Companys common stock, as well as
unanticipated changes in the Companys workforce.
In May2005, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement
of APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting
Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements SFAS154. SFAS154 changes the requirements for
the accounting for, and reporting of, a change in accounting principle. Previously, voluntary changes in accounting
principles were generally required to be recognized by way of a cumulative
effect adjustment within net income during the period of the change. SFAS154 requires retrospective
application to prior periods financial statements, unless it is impracticable
to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the
change. SFAS154 is effective for
accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005;
however, the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing
accounting pronouncements. The Company
does not believe adoption of SFAS154 will have a material effect on its financial position, cash flows or results of
operations. 69 Note2BASIC AND DILUTED NET INCOME
PER SHARE
Basic net income per share
is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period, excluding any unvested restricted stock that is subject to
repurchase. Diluted net income per share
is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if
dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of unvested
restricted stock awards using the treasury stock method, the incremental common shares issuable upon
the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method and the
conversion of the Companys zero coupon senior convertible notes using the
if-converted method. For 2003, 2004,
and 2005, approximately 87million, 50million and 55million
options to purchase common stock, respectively, were excluded from the
calculation, as the exercise prices were greater than the average market price
of the common stock during the respective years. See Note9 Long-Term Debt for
additional information.

Europe, previously joint ventures with SOFTBANK Corp. SOFTBANK.
Acquisitions
completed in 2003
Inktomi. On
March19, 2003, the Company completed the acquisition of Inktomi
Corporation Inktomi, a provider of search and paid inclusion services on
the Internet. The acquisition combined
the Companys global audience and Inktomis search technology to allow the
Company to create a more relevant, comprehensive and higher quality search
offering on the Internet. In
February2004, the Company launched its own branded algorithmic search
technology, Yahoo! Search Technology, based on Inktomis search technology and
began deployment on a worldwide basis. These
factors contributed to a purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net
tangible and intangible assets acquired from Inktomi and as a result, the
Company has recorded goodwill in connection with this transaction.
The total purchase price
of approximately $290million consisted of $273million in cash
consideration, $14million related to 2million stock options
exchanged and direct transaction costs of $3million. The $273million of total cash
consideration less cash acquired of approximately $45million resulted in
a net cash outlay of $228million. The
value of the stock options was determined using the Black-Scholes option
valuation model.
The allocation of
the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the fair
values was as follows in thousands

to in-process research and development and $208 million has been allocated to
goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess
of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible
assets acquired and is not deductible for tax purposes. Liabilities assumed included approximately
$23million of restructuring costs associated with the acquisition 6million of which related to workforce reduction and the remainder
related to excess facilities. As of December31,
2005, approximately $9million remained related to excess facilities.
Overture. On
October7, 2003, the Company completed the acquisition of Overture
Services,Inc. Overture, a provider of commercial search services on
the Internet, including sponsored search services. The Company believed that the combined assets
of the Company and Overture would further position it as a leader in the
Internet advertising sector. Together, the
two companies would be able to provide a diversified suite of integrated
marketing solutions, including branding, paid placement, graphical
advertisements, text based links, multimedia and contextual advertising. These factors contributed to a purchase price
in excess of the fair market value of the net tangible and intangible assets
acquired from Overture and as a result, the Company has recorded goodwill in
connection with this transaction.
Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, each
outstanding share of Overture was exchanged for 12216 shares of Yahoo! common
stock, representing approximately 79million shares valued at
$13billion and $475 per share in cash, which amounted to
$309million in aggregate cash, and together with $136million related
to 19million stock options exchanged and direct transaction costs of
$10million, resulted in an aggregate purchase price of $17billion.
The approximate $309million of
total cash consideration less cash acquired of $161million resulted in a
net cash outlay of $148million. The
value of the Yahoo! common stock was determined based on the average market
price of the common stock over the five day period surrounding the date the
acquisition was announced in July2003. The value of the stock options was determined
using the Black-Scholes option valuation model.

has been allocated to in-process research and development and $11 billion has
been allocated to goodwill. Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net
tangible and intangible assets acquired and is not deductible for tax purposes.
Other tangible assets acquired of
approximately $238million included long-term prepaid traffic acquisition
costs paid by Overture to Yahoo! of $30million. Liabilities assumed of approximately
$235million included a current liability for traffic acquisition costs
owed by Overture to Yahoo! of $28million. Liabilities assumed included approximately
$26million of restructuring costs associated with the acquisition 18million of  72 which related to workforce
reduction and the remainder related to excess facilities. As of December31, 2005, there was no
remaining balance related to severance costs or excess facilities.
Acquisitions completed in 2004
3721. On
January2, 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of 3721 Network
Software Company Limited 3721, a Hong Kong-based software development
company. The acquisition combined the
Companys global audience and 3721s keyword search technology to enable the
Company to continue improving its global search services. These factors contributed to a purchase price
in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired from
3721 and as a result, the Company has recorded goodwill in connection with this
transaction.
The total purchase price of approximately
$95million consisted of $92million in cash consideration 2million related to stock options exchanged and direct transaction costs
of $1million. The total cash
consideration of approximately $92million less cash acquired of approximately
$7million resulted in a net cash outlay of $85million.

Interests for a description of the Companys investment in Alibaba and the
related divestiture of 3721.
Kelkoo. On
April5, 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of a majority
interest in Kelkoo S.A. Kelkoo, a leading European online comparison
shopping service. In July2004, the
Company completed the acquisition of additional interests in Kelkoo, increasing
the Companys total ownership interest in Kelkoo to 100percent. The acquisition expanded the Companys global
commerce presence and together with the Companys existing services increased
the Companys competitive position in Europe. These factors contributed to a purchase price
in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired from
Kelkoo and as a result, the Company has recorded goodwill in connection with
this transaction.
The total purchase price of approximately $571million
consisted of $562million in cash consideration, $6million in
incurred liabilities and direct transaction costs of $3million. The total cash consideration of approximately
$562million less cash acquired of $39million resulted in a net cash

the Companys presence in the digital music business and together with the
Companys existing music services, Yahoo! Music, provided one of the most
comprehensive suite of music services for users, marketers, artists and record
labels. These factors contributed to a
purchase price in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible
assets acquired from Musicmatch and as a result, the Company has recorded
goodwill in connection with this transaction.
The total purchase price of $158million
consisted of $157million in cash consideration and direct transaction
costs of $1million. The

Acquisitions completed in 2005
Verdisoft
Corporation. On February11, 2005 the Company
acquired Verdisoft Corporation Verdisoft, a software development company. The acquisition of Verdisoft enhanced the
Companys platform for delivering content and services to mobile devices as
part of the Companys strategy to provide users with seamless access to its
network. The transaction was treated as
an asset acquisition for accounting purposes and therefore no goodwill was
recorded. The estimated purchase price
was approximately $58million and consisted of $54million in cash
consideration, $3million related to stock options exchanged and
$1million of direct transaction costs. In connection with the acquisition, the
Company also issued approximately 1million shares of restricted stock
valued at $35million that will be recognized as expense over three years.
For accounting purposes, approximately
$93million was allocated to amortizable intangible assets 37million to liabilities, primarily deferred income tax liabilities, and
$2million to deferred stock-based compensation. The amortizable intangible assets have useful
lives not exceeding four years and a weighted average useful life of
approximately 3 years.
Yahoo! Europe and
Yahoo! Korea. In November1996, the Company entered into joint ventures
with SOFTBANK Corp., including its
consolidated affiliates SOFTBANK
whereby separate companies were formed in the United Kingdom, France and
Germany, collectively Yahoo! Europe which established and managed local
versions of Yahoo! in those countries. In
August1997, the Company entered into a similar joint venture with
SOFTBANK in Korea. Prior to November2005,
the Company had a majority share of approximately 70 percent in each of the
Yahoo! Europe entities and 67 percent in Yahoo! Korea and therefore the results
of these entities were included in the Companys consolidated financial
statements, with minority interests separately presented on the consolidated
statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets. On November23, 2005, the Company
purchased SOFTBANKs remaining shares in the joint ventures giving the Company
100 percent ownership in these entities.
The total purchase price of $501million
consisted of $500million in cash consideration and direct transaction
costs of $1million.

of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible
assets acquired and is not deductible for tax purposes.
Other Acquisitions 
Business Combinations. During
the year ended December31, 2005, the Company acquired four other
companies which were accounted for as business combinations. The total purchase for these four acquisitions
was approximately $79 million and consisted of $73 million in cash consideration 3 million related to stock options exchanged and $3 million of direct
transaction costs. The total cash
consideration of $73 million less cash acquired of $3 million resulted in net
cash outlay of $70 million. Of the
purchase price, $58 million was allocated to goodwill, $32 million to
amortizable intangible assets and $11 million to net assumed liabilities. Approximately $1 million was allocated to
in-process research and development and expensed in the consolidated statements
of operations. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the
fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and is not
deductible for tax purposes.
The purchase price allocations for these acquisitions
are preliminary and subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed
and additional information on the fair value of assets and liabilities becomes
available. Any change in the fair value
of the net assets of the acquired companies will change the amount of the
purchase price allocable to goodwill.
In each of the three years ended December31,
2005 the Company also completed immaterial asset acquisitions that did not
qualify as business combinations.
Pro forma results of operations have not been
presented for the acquisitions completed during the years ended
December31, 2004 and 2005 as the results of the acquired companies, not
already consolidated, either individually or in the aggregate were not material
to the Companys financial results before the acquisitions.

Equity Investment in Alibaba. On October23, 2005, the
Company acquired approximately 46 percent of the outstanding common stock of Alibaba, which
represents approximately 40 percent on a fully diluted basis, in exchange for
$10 billion in cash, the contribution of the Companys China based businesses,
including 3721 Yahoo China and direct transaction costs of $8 million. Pursuant to the terms of a shareholder
agreement, the Company has an approximate 35 percent voting interest in
Alibaba, with the remainder of its voting rights subject to a voting agreement
with Alibaba management. Other investors
in Alibaba include SOFTBANK.
Through this transaction, the Company has combined its
leading search capabilities with Alibabas leading online marketplace and
online payment system and Alibabas strong local presence, expertise and vision
in the China market. These factors
contributed to a purchase price in excess of the Companys share of the fair
value of Alibabas net tangible and intangible assets acquired resulting in
goodwill.
The purchase price was based on acquiring a 40 percent
equity interest in Alibaba on a fully diluted basis. The Companys equity interest in Alibaba may
be diluted from approximately 46 percent to 40 percent  76 upon the conversion of Alibabas outstanding
convertible debt and exercises of Alibabas employee stock options. In allocating the excess of the carrying
value of its investment in Alibaba over its proportionate share of the net
assets of Alibaba, the Company allocated a portion of the excess to goodwill to
account for the estimated reductions in the carrying value of the investment in
Alibaba that may occur as the Companys equity interest is diluted from
approximately 46 percent to 40 percent.
The
difference between the Companys carrying value of its investment in Alibaba
and its proportionate share of the net assets of Alibaba is summarized as
follows in thousands

The amortizable intangible assets have useful lives
not exceeding seven years and a weighted average useful life of approximately 5
years. No amount has been allocated to
in-process research and development. The
preliminary allocation is subject to revision as more detailed analysis is
completed and additional information on the assets and liabilities of Alibaba
as of the closing date becomes available.
Any change in the net assets of Alibaba will change the amount of the
purchase price allocable to goodwill. Goodwill
is not deductible for tax purposes.
The investment in Alibaba is being accounted for using
the equity method and the total investment, including net tangible assets,
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are classified as part of the
Investment in equity interests balance on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company will record its share of the
results of Alibaba and any related amortization expense, one quarter in arrears
within earnings in equity interests. Following
the acquisition date, Yahoo! China has not been included in the Companys
consolidated results but will be included within earnings in equity interests
to the extent of the Companys continued ownership interest in Alibaba,
commencing in the first quarter of 2006.
The revenues and operating income of Yahoo! China were not material to
the consolidated results of the Company for the years ended December31,
2003 and 2004 and the period from January1, 2005 to October23,
2005, the date of the divestiture of Yahoo! China. In connection with the transaction, the
Company also recorded a non-cash gain of $338 million in other income, net
based on the difference between the fair value of Yahoo! China and its carrying
value adjusted for the Companys continued ownership in the newly combined
entity. As described above, the Companys
interest in Alibaba may be diluted from approximately 46 percent to 40 percent. The Company will recognize further non-cash
gains as such dilution occurs.
Equity Investment in Yahoo! Japan. During
April1996, the Company signed a joint venture agreement with SOFTBANK,
which was amended in September1997, whereby Yahoo! Japan Corporation Yahoo!
Japan was formed. Yahoo! Japan was
formed to establish and manage a local version of Yahoo! in Japan. The Company also has commercial arrangements
with Yahoo! Japan, consisting of services, including algorithmic search
services and sponsored search services and the related traffic acquisition
costs and license fees. Due to the
acquisition of Overture, traffic acquisition costs have increased resulting in
the net cost of these arrangements of approximately $67 million and $171
million for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2005, respectively,
compared to net revenues of $9 millionfor the year ended December31,
2003. In the second quarter of 2005, the
Company received a cash dividend in the amount  77 of $11 million which was recorded as a reduction in
the Companys investment in Yahoo! Japan.
As of December31, 2004 and 2005, the Company had a net payable
balance to Yahoo! Japan of approximately $30 million and $7million,
respectively.
The investment in Yahoo! Japan is being accounted for
using the equity method. The fair value
of the Companys approximate 34percent ownership in Yahoo! Japan, based
on the quoted stock price, was approximately $15 billion as of December31,
2005.
Prior to and during 2001, Yahoo! Japan acquired the
Companys equity interests in certain entities in Japan for total consideration
of approximately $65million, paid partially in shares of Yahoo! Japan
common stock and partially in cash. As a
result of the acquisition, the Company increased its investment in Yahoo!
Japan, which resulted in approximately $41million of goodwill to be
amortized over seven years. The amortization
ceased upon the adoption of SFAS142 on January1, 2002. The carrying amount of the Companys
investment in Yahoo! Japan differs from the amount of the underlying equity in
net assets of Yahoo! Japan primarily as a result of this goodwill.
As of December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had
$304 million and $176 million, respectively, included in retained earnings
relating to its investment in Yahoo! Japan.
The
Company records its share of the results of Yahoo! Japan one quarter in arrears
within earnings in equity interests. The
following table presents Yahoo! Japans condensed financial information, as

The Companys investment portfolio consists of
government and high-quality corporate securities. Investments in both fixed rate and floating
rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair
market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating
rate securities may produce less income than expected in interest rates fall. The longer the term of the securities, the
more susceptible they are to changes in market rates of interest and yields on
bonds. Investments are reviewed
periodically to identify possible other-than-temporary impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company
reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has
been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and the Companys
ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be
sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value. The Company has the intent and ability to
hold these securities for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a
forecasted recovery of fair value up to or beyond the initial cost of the
investment. The Company expects to
realize the full value of all of these investments upon maturity or sale.
Note9 LONG-TERM DEBT
In April2003, the Company issued
$750million of zero coupon senior convertible notes the Notes due April2008,
which resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately
$733million after transaction fees of $17million, which have been
deferred and are included on the consolidated balance sheets in long-term other
assets. As of December31, 2005 8million of the transaction fees remained to be amortized. The Notes were issued at par and bear no
interest. The Notes are convertible into
Yahoo! common stock at a conversion price of $2050 per share, which would
result in the issuance of an aggregate of approximately 37million shares,
subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Each  83 1,000 principal amount of the Notes will initially be
convertible into 4878 shares of Yahoo! common stock.
The Notes are convertible prior to the final maturity
date 1during any fiscal quarter if the closing sale price of the
Companys common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 trading-day
period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal
quarter exceeded 110percent of the conversion price on that 30thtrading day, 2during the period
beginning January1, 2008 through the maturity date, if the closing sale
price of the Companys common stock on the previous trading day was
110percent or more of the then current conversion price and 3upon
specified corporate transactions. Upon
conversion, the Company has the right to deliver cash in lieu of common stock. The Company may be required to repurchase all
of the Notes following a fundamental change of the Company, such as a change of
control, prior to maturity at face value.
The Company may not redeem the Notes prior to their maturity.
As of December31, 2005, the market price
condition for convertibility of the Notes was satisfied with respect to the
fiscal quarter beginning January1, 2006 and ending on March31, 2006. During this period holders of the Notes will
be able to convert their Notes into shares of Yahoo! common stock at the rate
of 4878 shares of Yahoo! common stock for each Note. The Notes will also be convertible into
shares of Yahoo! common stock in subsequent fiscal quarters, if any, with
respect to which the market price condition for convertibility is met.
As of December31,
2005, the fair value of the Notes was approximately $14billion based on
quoted market prices. The shares
issuable upon conversion of the Notes have been included in the computation of
diluted net income per share since the Notes were issued.

85 As of December 31,
2005, the Companys federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for
income tax purposes were approximately $27 billion and $10 billion,
respectively. If not utilized, the
federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2008, and
approximately $422 million of the state net operating loss carryforwards will
expire in 2006. The Companys federal
and state research tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes are
approximately $94 million and $99 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal research tax
credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2010. The state research tax credit carryforwards
will not expire.
The Company has a
valuation allowance of approximately $15 billion as of December 31, 2005 to
reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to
be realized in future periods. In
evaluating the Companys ability to recover its deferred income tax assets the
Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including operating
results, ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a
jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.
Approximately $966 million of the deferred income tax
asset balance as of December31, 2005 pertains to certain net operating
loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards resulting from the exercise of
employee stock options. Approximately
$215 million of the deferred income tax asset balance relates to net operating
losses acquired in certain business combinations and will result in adjustments
to goodwill if and when recognized. Approximately
$96million of the deferred income tax asset balance relates to foreign
net operating loss and credit carryforwards and will reduce the provision for
income taxes if and when recognized. The
benefit of the remaining $1,197 million of unrealized deferred income tax
assets will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid-in capital if and
when recognized.
The Company provides
United States income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the
subsidiaries earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the
United States. As of December31,
2005, the Company had unrecorded deferred income tax liabilities of
approximately $16 million related to $45 million of cumulative net
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
These earnings are considered indefinitely invested in operations
outside the United States, as the Company intends to utilize these amounts to
fund future expansion of its international operations.

The weighted average fair value of options granted in
the years ended December31, 2003, 2004, and 2005 was $687, $1209 and
$1160 per share, respectively.
Options to purchase approximately 128million
shares and 119million shares were exercisable as of December31,
2003 and 2004, respectively. The
weighted average exercise prices per share for options exercisable as of
December31, 2003 and 2004 were $2463 and $2646, respectively.
Restricted Stock. The 1995 Stock Plan permits the
granting of restricted stock and restricted stock units, collectively referred
to as restricted stock awards. The
1995 Stock Plan permits the granting of restricted stock awards either alone,
in addition to, or in tandem with other equity-based awards made by the Company. Rights of repurchase on restricted stock
awards grants generally lapse upon meeting certain performance-based
milestones, or passage of time, or a combination of both. Restricted stock award grants are generally
measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares
granted and the quoted price of the Companys common stock. Such value is recognized as an expense over
the corresponding service period. Restricted
stock awards that have performance criteria are subject to variable accounting
treatment. Approximately 04million,
04million, and 7million shares of restricted stock awards were
granted during 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively, with average fair market
values of $2058, $3499, and $3686 per share on the date of grant.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company has an Employee
Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan, which allows employees to purchase
shares of the Companys common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15
percent of their annual compensation up to certain Internal Revenue Code prescribed
maximums. The price of the common stock
purchased under the Purchase Plan is equal to 85percent of the lower of
the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each 24-month
offering period or the specified purchase date.
The Purchase Plan provides for the issuance of a maximum of
approximately 30million shares of common stock. During 2003, approximately 3million
shares were purchased at prices from $463 to $1053 per share. During 2004, approximately 2million
shares were purchased at prices from $1858 to $2148 per share. During 2005, approximately 3million
shares were purchased at prices from $1858 to $2933 per share. Shares available for future issuance under
the Purchase Plan as of December31, 2005 totaled approximately
15million shares.
Stock-Based Compensation. The Company measures
compensation expense for its stock-based employee compensation plans
using the intrinsic value method. The
Company recorded compensation expense of approximately $22million 32million and $52million in 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. The recorded  89 stock
compensation expense relates to the amortization of the intrinsic value of
Yahoo! stock options issued and assumed in connection with business
combinations and other equity-based awards issued by the Company. This expense is generally being amortized
using the accelerated amortization method in accordance with FASB
Interpretation No. 28 Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other
Variable Stock Option or Award Plans.
As of December31, 2005, approximately $235million remains to
be amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the options and restricted
stock awards when calculated using the intrinsic value method. This amount is not reflective of the future
total stock-based compensation expense that will be recorded using the fair
value based method for options that will vest in the future. If the fair value based method had been
applied in measuring stock compensation expense, the pro forma effect on net
income and net income per share would have been as follows in thousands,

The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable. In addition, option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including
the expected stock price volatility. Because
additional stock options are expected to be granted each year, the pro forma
disclosures are not representative of pro forma effects on reported financial
results for future years. The fair value
of option grants is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model with the following weighted average assumptions

1 Up to September30, 2005, the Company used an
equally weighted average of trailing volatility and market based implied
volatility for the computation. Since October1,
2005 the Company began exclusively using market based implied volatility for
the computation.
2 For the year ended December31, 2003
the stock compensation expense amounts have been adjusted to reflect lower
calculated fair values for employee stock options, which resulted in an
increase of $33million $002 per share in the pro forma net income. This adjustment was required as the Companys
estimate of the fair value of employee stock options was incorrectly based on a
five-and-one-half year expected life rather than the three year expected life
intended by management. 90 Note13COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

any additional lease space that becomes available.
In
2005, the Company entered into three ten year lease agreement for office space
in Southern California with total expected minimum lease commitments of
approximately $153 million over the lease terms and remaining minimum lease
commitments of approximately $152 million as of December31, 2005. In each of these leases, the Company has the
option to renew for two additional terms of three to five years as well as the
right of expansion for any additional lease space that becomes available. Further, in the case of two of these leases,
the Company has the right of first offer to purchase the leased office space if
the lessor sells the building.
Rent expense for all operating leases was
approximately $21 million, $34 million, and $55 million for 2003, 2004, and
2005, respectively.
Many of the Companys leases contain one or more of
the following options which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial
lease term: arenewal of the lease for a defined number of years at the
then fair market rental rate or at a slight discount to the fair market rental
rate; bpurchase of the property at the then fair market value; or cright
of first offer to lease additional space that becomes available.

Other Commitments. In the ordinary course of business, the Company may
provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors,
lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters,
including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Companys breach of
such agreements, services to be provided by the Company, or from intellectual
property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into
indemnification agreements with its  91 directors and certain of its officers that will
require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain
liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or
officers. The Company has also agreed to
indemnify certain former officers and directors of acquired companies in
connection with the acquisition of such companies. The Company maintains director and officer
insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from its obligation to
indemnify its directors and officers and former directors and officers of
acquired companies, in certain circumstances.
It is not possible to determine the maximum potential
amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of
prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in
each particular agreement. Such
indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, the Company has not incurred
material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements and it has not
accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in its consolidated
financial statements.
On April21, 2003, Overture completed its
purchase of the Web Search unit of Fast Search and Transfer ASA, a Norway based
developer of search and real-time filtering technologies, for $70million
in cash, plus a contingent earn-out payment of up to $30million over
three years based on specified operating criteria. The earn-out payment is not included in the
contractual obligations table.

Note9Long-Term Debt for additional information related to the
long-term debt.
2 The Company is obligated to make payments under
contracts to provide sponsored search services to its affiliates, which
represent traffic acquisition costs.
As of December31, 2004 and 2005, the Company did
not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or
special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of
facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or
limited purposes. As such, the Company
is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could
arise if the Company had engaged in such relationships.
Contingencies. From
time to time, third parties assert patent infringement claims against the
Company. Currently, the Company is
engaged in several lawsuits regarding patent issues and has been notified of a
number of other potential patent disputes.
In addition, from time to time the Company is subject to other legal
proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of
alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property
rights, and a variety of claims, including claims alleging defamation or
invasion of privacy, arising in connection with its e-mail, message boards,
auction sites, shopping services, and other communications and community
features.
On May24, 2001, Arista Records,Inc., Bad
Boy Records, BMG Music d/b/a The RCA Records Label, Capitol Records,Inc.,
Virgin Records America,Inc., Sony Music Entertainment,Inc., UMG
Recordings,Inc., Interscope Records, Motown Record Company, L.P., and
Zomba Recording  92 Corporation filed a lawsuit alleging copyright
infringement against LAUNCH in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York. The
plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the consumer-influenced
portion of LAUNCHs LAUNCHcast service is interactive within the meaning of Section114
of the Copyright Act and therefore does not qualify for the compulsory license
provided for by the Copyright Act. The
Complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief and damages for the alleged
infringement. After the lawsuit was
commenced, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire LAUNCH. In June2001, LAUNCH settled the LAUNCH
litigation as to UMG Recordings,Inc.
The Companys acquisition of LAUNCH closed in August2001, and
since that time LAUNCH has been a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company and LAUNCH do not believe that
LAUNCH has infringed any rights of plaintiffs and intend to vigorously contest
the lawsuit. In January2003,
LAUNCH settled the LAUNCH litigation as to Sony Music Entertainment,Inc. In October2003, LAUNCH settled the
litigation as to Capitol Records,Inc. and Virgin Records America,Inc. Accordingly, BMG Music d/b/a/ The RCA Records
Label is the sole remaining plaintiff in this proceeding. On March16, 2004 the plaintiff filed
motions for partial summary judgment on the issues of willful infringement and
whether the consumer-influenced portion of LAUNCHs LAUNCHcast service is
interactive within the meaning of Section114 of the Copyright Act and
therefore does not qualify for the compulsory license provided for by the
Copyright Act. LAUNCH filed its
opposition to the motions for partial summary judgment on April30, 2004,
and a hearing on the motions was held on June18, 2004. On November4, 2005, the Court issued an
order denying the plaintiffs summary judgment motions as to infringement and
willful infringement. A trial date is
currently set for June2006. The
Company does not believe it is feasible to predict or determine the outcome or
resolution of the remaining LAUNCH litigation at this time. The range of possible resolutions of such
LAUNCH litigation could include judgments against LAUNCH or settlements that
could require substantial payments by LAUNCH.
On July12, 2001, the first of several purported
securities class action lawsuits was filed in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York against certain underwriters involved in
Overtures initial public offering, Overture, and certain of Overtures current
and former officers and directors. The
Court consolidated the cases against Overture.
Plaintiffs allege, among other things, violations of the Securities Act
of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 involving undisclosed
compensation to the underwriters, and improper practices by the underwriters,
and seek unspecified damages. Similar
complaints were filed in the same court against numerous public companies that
conducted initial public offerings of their common stock since the mid-1990s. All of these lawsuits were consolidated for
pretrial purposes before Judge Shira Scheindlin. On April19, 2002, plaintiffs filed an
amended complaint, alleging Rule10b-5 claims of fraud. On July15, 2002, the issuers filed a
motion to dismiss for failure to comply with applicable pleading standards. On October8, 2002, the Court entered an
Order of Dismissal as to all of the individual defendants in the Overture IPO
litigation, without prejudice. On February19,
2003, the Court denied the motion to dismiss the Rule10b-5 claims
against certain defendants, including Overture.
On August31, 2005, the Court entered an order confirming its
preliminary approval of a settlement proposal made by plaintiffs, which
includes settlement of, and release of claims against, the issuer defendants,
including Overture. A hearing on the
fairness of the settlement to the shareholder class is currently set for April24,
2006. If the settlement does not occur,
and litigation against Overture continues, the Company and Overture believe
that Overture has meritorious defenses to liability and damages and will
continue to defend the case vigorously.
The Company does not
believe, based on current knowledge, that any of the foregoing legal
proceedings or claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on its
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the Company may incur substantial
expenses in defending against third party claims. In the event of a determination adverse to
the Company or its subsidiaries, the Company may incur substantial monetary
liability, and be required to change its business practices. Either of these could have a material adverse
effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. 93 Note14LITIGATION SETTLEMENT
In April2002, the Companys wholly owned subsidiary,
Overture, filed a lawsuit against GoogleInc. Google in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California with respect to a
patent which protected various features and innovations relating to
bid-for-performance products and Overtures pay-for-performance sponsored
search technologies. In addition, the
Company had a second dispute with Google concerning the shares issuable to the
Company pursuant to a warrant held by the Company to purchase Google shares
that were received in connection with a June2000 services agreement.
In August2004, Google issued 27million
shares of ClassA common stock in settlement of the two disputes. The Company agreed to dismiss the 361 patent
lawsuits and granted to Google a fully-paid license to the 361 patent as well
as several related patent applications held by Overture. The Company allocated the 27million
shares between the two disputes, based on the relative fair values of the two
disputes, including consideration of a valuation performed by a third party. A portion of the shares allocated to the
patent dispute has been recorded as an adjustment to goodwill for the period
that the patents were in effect prior to Overtures acquisition by the Company. The portion of the shares received for the
settlement of the patent dispute which has been allocated to future periods has
been recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets and will
be recognized as fees revenues over the remaining life of the patent,
approximately12years. The
shares allocated to the warrant dispute settlement did not have an income
statement effect as the fair value of the warrant was recorded at the time the
services were performed based on the fair value of the services rendered.
During the year ended December31,
2004, the Company disposed of approximately 40million shares of Google
and realized gains of $413million, net of selling costs, which were
included in other income, net on the consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December31, 2005
the Company sold the remaining Google shares and realized gains of $961
million, which were recorded in other income, net.
Note15SEGMENTS
The Company manages its business geographically. The primary areas of measurement and decision-making
are the United States and International.
Management relies on an internal management reporting process that
provides revenue and segment operating income before depreciation and
amortization for making financial decisions and allocating resources. Segment operating income before depreciation
and amortization includes income from operations before depreciation,
amortization of intangible assets and amortization of stock compensation
expense. Management believes that
segment operating income before depreciation and amortization is an appropriate
measure for evaluating the operational performance of the Companys segments. However, this measure should be considered in
addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, income from operations or
other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. 94 The

for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2004 in order to refine the
alignment of revenue sources with these classifications.
Revenues from the Companys
agreements with Overture were included in marketing services for the period
from January1, 2003 through October7, 2003. Revenues from Overture for the period from January1,
2003 through October7, 2003, amounted to 12percent of total
revenues for the year ended December31, 2003. 95 Note16RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company and other third parties are limited
partners in Softbank Capital Partners LP Softbank Capital, a venture
capital fund which is an affiliate of SOFTBANK.
A Managing Partner of Softbank Capital is also a member of the Companys
Board of Directors. The total investment
by the Company in Softbank Capital is approximately $36million and
represents less than a 5 percent holding in Softbank Capital. A significant portion of this investment has
been impaired by the Company, with the remaining value included on the
consolidated balance sheets in other assets.
Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the Company invested on the same
terms and on the same basis as all other limited partners.
Revenue from related parties, excluding Yahoo! Japan,
represented no more than 1 percent of the total revenue in the years ended December31,
2003, 2004, and 2005. Management
believes that prices on agreements with related parties were comparable to
those with other similarly situated customers of the Company.
See Note4 Investments
in Equity Interests for additional information related to transactions
involving Yahoo! Japan.
Note17SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Joint Venture with Seven Networks
Limited. On
January29, 2006, the Company and Seven Network Limited Seven, a
leading Australian mediacompany, completed a strategic partnership in
which the Company contributed its Australian Internet business, Yahoo!
Australia and New Zealand, and Seven contributed its online assets, television
and magazine content, an option to purchase its 33 percent ownership interest
in mobile solutions provider m.Net Corporation Ltd, and cash of AUD $10 million
approximately $7 million. The Company
has a 50 percent equity ownership interest in the newly formed entity, which
will operate as Yahoo!7. Pursuant to a
shareholders agreement and a power of attorney granted by Seven to vote certain
of its shares, the Company has the right to vote 501 percent of the
outstanding voting interests in Yahoo!7 and control over the day-to-day
operations and will therefore consolidate Yahoo!7s results.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Companys management,
with the participation of the Companys principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys
disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rules13a-15eand
15d-15eunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the
Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Companys
principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded

are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely
basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act.
Managements
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The Companys management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as defined in Rules13a-15fand 15d-15funder
the Exchange Act. Under the supervision
and with the participation of the Companys management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
reporting based on criteria established in the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, the Companys
management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December31, 2005.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Companys independent
registered public accounting firm has audited managements assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2005 as stated in their report which appears on page58.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have not been any
changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting as such
term is defined in Rules13a-15fand 15d-15funder
the Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal
control over financial reporting.
