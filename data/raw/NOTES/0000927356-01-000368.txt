SCHEDULE II - - VALUATION AND QUALIFYING 
25             Independent Auditors' Report
The Board of Directors
Carrier Access Corporation   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Carrier
Access Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 2000, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2000.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of Carrier Access
Corporation management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Carrier
Access Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 2000, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000
1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a. Business and Basis of Presentation. Carrier Access Corporation CAC
or the Company is a leading provider of broadband digital access equipment to
communications service providers, including competitive local exchange carriers,
Internet service providers, IOCs, IXEs and wireless service providers, which is
used for the provisioning of enhanced voice and high-speed Internet services by
service providers to end users such as small and medium-sized businesses and
government and educational institutions. The Company sells its products through
distributors and directly to end user customers. The Company operates in one
business segment and substantially all of its sales and operations are domestic.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
b. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Available-for-Sale.
Cash and cash equivalents include investments in highly liquid debt securities
with maturities or interest reset dates of three months or less at the time of
purchase.
Marketable securities available-for-sale represent U.S. Government Agency
and corporate bonds with maturities of greater than three months and are
recorded at fair value. At December 31, 1999 and 2000, amortized cost
approximates market value. Securities available-for-sale consisted of the
following as of December 31 in thousands, except percentages                          Amortized Cost and Market Value       2000 Interest Rates

Short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale as defined by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and accordingly are recorded at fair
value. Increases or decreases in the fair value of investments classified as
available-for-sale are recorded in comprehensive income loss, net of the
related tax effect.
c. Inventory. Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market using
standard costs that approximate average costs. Costs include certain warehousing
costs and other allocable overhead.
d. Property and Equipment. Property, equipment and leasehold improvements
are recorded at cost and are depreciated and amortized using the straight-line
method over useful lives ranging from three to thirty years or the lease term.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 1998,
1999 and 2000 totaled $470,000, $1,012,000, and $ 3,009,000, respectively.
e. Goodwill and Other Intangibles. Goodwill and other intangibles are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated future periods to be
benefited which range from three to five years. Goodwill and other intangibles,
net were $169 million at December 31, 2000. There was no goodwill or other
intangibles at December 31, 1999.
f. Revenue Recognition. Revenue from sales of products is recognized upon
shipment. Reserves for estimated sales returns through stock rotation are
recorded when sales are made to customers with the right of return and are based
on management estimate of expected returns and historical experience.
The Company provides limited price protection to its distributors, whereby
increases in prices are subject to a 60-day notice period before becoming
effective. In addition, the distributor is entitled to receive a credit for
subsequent price decreases to the extent of unsold distributor inventory at the
time of the price decrease. The Company also provides its distributors with
limited stock rotation rights, whereby products may be returned for an equal
dollar amount of new or different equipment. Customers are limited to three
exchanges per year and an amount equal to 15% of purchases in the preceding
four-month period. Neither of these rights affect the total sales price or
payment obligations of the customer. In addition, the customers' obligation to
the Company is not contingent upon
31 the ultimate resale of the products. The Company provides for the estimated
impact of price protection and stock rotation rights in its allowance for
estimated returns based on historical experience and management forecasts of
price protection credits and returns.
g. Advertising Costs. In addition to its own advertising activities, the
Company accrues a specified percentage of the previous quarter sales over
certain contractual minimums to reimburse distributors for a portion of their
advertising costs. Any unused allowance expires if not used within the following
six months. Cooperative advertising expense for the years ended December 31,
1998, 1999 and 2000 totaled $342,442, $269,224, and $83,422, respectively, and
is included in sales and marketing expense.
h. Research and Development Costs. Research and development costs are
charged to operations as incurred.
i. Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets are comprised of intangible assets
and property, plant and equipment. Long-lived assets, including certain
identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to those assets to be held and
used, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the asset, or the
appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine
whether an impairment exists, pursuant to the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-
Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. If an asset is
determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on quoted market prices in
active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the
estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a
discounted value of estimated future cash flows and fundamental analysis. The
Company reports an asset to be disposed of at the lower of its carrying value or
its estimated net realizable value.
j. Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes SFAS 109. Under the asset and liability method of SFAS 109, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under SFAS 109, the effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is
required to the extent any deferred tax assets may not be realizable.
k. Income Per Share. Income per share EPS is presented in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share
SFAS 128. SFAS 128 requires the presentation of basic and diluted EPS. Under
SFAS 128, basic EPS excludes dilution for potential common shares and is
computed by dividing income or loss available to common stockholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted and resulted in the
issuance of common stock. Diluted income per share includes the impact of common
stock options and excludes the impact of redeemable preferred stock, as the
effect of the assumed conversion of the preferred stock and the elimination of
the related dividend requirement would be antidilutive.
l. Stock-Based Compensation. The Company accounts for its stock-based
employee compensation plan using the intrinsic value based method prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB 25, and related interpretations. The Company has provided pro
forma disclosures of net income and income per share, as if the fair value based
method of accounting for the plan, as prescribed by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS
123, had been applied.
Stock options issued to consultants and others for services are recorded at
fair value as prescribed by SFAS 123. Charges to operations associated with
these option grants were not significant during the years ended December 31,
1998, 1999 and 2000.
m. Warranty Costs. The Company provides limited warranty protection to
customers for a period of up to five years from the date of sale for parts and
labor. The Company has accrued for its warranty obligations based on historical
experience and management estimate of future warranty costs to be incurred.
n. Comprehensive Income. Comprehensive income consists of net unrealized
holding gains or losses on available-for-sale securities.
2.  Acquisitions
In August of 2000, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding
common stock of Millennia Systems, Inc. Millennia for cash of approximately
$21 million, 163,004 shares of common stock valued at approximately $73
million and the exchange of vested employee stock options valued at
approximately $04 million, for total consideration of approximately $98
million. Based on the purchase price allocation, approximately $98 million of
the purchase price was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets,
including workforce, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over
periods ranging from three to five years. In addition, unvested Millennia stock
options were replaced with equivalent unvested stock options of the Company.
The excess of the fair value of the Company common stock over the exercise
prices of the stock options, which totaled approximately $877,000, was recorded
as deferred stock option compensation and will be expensed over the vesting
period of the stock options. Millennia, located in Roanoke, Virginia, develops
broadband communications equipment.
32  In October of 2000, the Company acquired the ATM product lines of Litton
Network Access Systems, a division of Litton Systems, Inc. LNAS for cash of
approximately $86 million. Based on the purchase price allocation,
approximately $80 million of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill and
other intangible assets, including workforce, customer base and core technology,
which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from
three to five years. LNAS is also located in Roanoke, Virginia.
Both of the acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting and accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the results of operations of the acquired businesses since the dates of
acquisition. The aggregate purchase prices of the acquisitions were allocated
based on fair values to current assets, equipment, goodwill and other
intangibles and current liabilities in the amounts of $10 million, $05
million, $178 million and $09 million, respectively.
The following unaudited pro forma information has been prepared assuming that
the acquisitions occurred on January 1, 1999 in thousands, except per share

The Company has analyzed the sources and expected reversal periods of its
deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2000, the Company has a research and
experimentation credit carryforward of approximately $21 million which will
expire in the year 2020 if not utilized. The Company believes that the tax
benefits attributable to deductible temporary differences will be realized by
recognition of future taxable amounts.
For the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, the Company
recognized $195,000, $8,023,000 and $4,557,210 as a direct increase to paid-in
capital for the income tax benefit resulting from the exercise of non-qualified
stock options by employees.
7.  Redeemable Preferred Stock and Initial Public Offering
During 1995, the Company authorized a new class of preferred stock,
consisting of 5,000,000 convertible Series A preferred shares with a par value
of $010 per share. The preferred shares were convertible, at the option of the
holder, into shares of common stock that was subject to the three-for-two
forward split. The preferred shares were redeemable at the option of a majority
of the preferred stockholders, any time after four years from the date of
issuance, provided that the Company had not achieved certain financial results
or completed a public offering of common stock, both as defined.
On June 21, 1996, the Company completed a private placement of 1,210,861
shares of Series A preferred stock at a price of $286 per share, for net
proceeds of $3,049,406. The private placement included 135,678 preferred shares
issued to note holders. In the event of the Company liquidation, or redemption
of the preferred shares, the Series A preferred stockholders were entitled to
$286 per share plus unpaid dividends equal to 15% of the liquidation value per
annum.
During 1997, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to authorize
a new class of preferred stock, consisting of 2,725,998 convertible Series B
preferred shares with a par value of $010 per share. On September 16, 1997, the
Company completed
34 a private placement of 2,517,894 shares of Series B preferred stock at a price
of $499 per share, for net proceeds of $12,514,291. In the event of the
Company liquidation, or redemption of the preferred shares, the Series B
stockholders were entitled to $499 per share plus unpaid dividends equal to 15%
of the liquidation value per annum.
In August of 1998, the Company completed its initial public offering of
3,450,000 shares of common stock at $1200 per share, for net proceeds of
approximately $376 million. Aggregate offering costs were approximately $38
million. In connection with the initial public offering, 1,210,861 shares of
Series A preferred stock and 2,517,894 shares of Series B preferred stock with a
liquidation value of $286 and $499 per share, respectively, were converted
into common stock, resulting in the issuance of 5,593,133 shares of common stock
to the preferred stockholders.
8.  Stock Options
Pursuant to the Company 1998 stock option plan the Plan, a committee
appointed by the Company Board of Directors may grant incentive and
nonqualified options to employees, consultants and directors. The Plan currently
authorizes the grant of options up to 4,875,000 shares of authorized common
stock. Incentive stock options have a ten-year term and non-qualified stock
options have a five-year term. A majority of the stock options vest 25% on the
first anniversary date of the grant and 625% each quarter thereafter, with the
remaining stock options vesting 100% five years from the grant date. As of
December 31, 2000, an aggregate of 6,879,794 options had been granted under the
Plan of which 1,234,120 were incentive stock options and 5,645,674 were non-
qualified stock options.

As discussed in Note 1, the Company applies APB 25 and related interpretations
in accounting for stock options issued to employees and directors. As a result,
for options issued with exercise prices below the estimated fair market value on
the date of grant, the Company recorded deferred compensation expense totaling
approximately $1,227,000 for options granted during the year ended December 31,
1997, and $1,921,000 for options granted during the year ended December 31,
1998. Such deferred compensation expense will be amortized to operations pro
rata over the forty-eight month option vesting period. Such amortization expense
totaled approximately $688,000, $818,000 and $497,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively. In 2000 the Company reversed
$514,000 against additional paid-in capital for forfeitures of deferred stock
compensation related to stock options issued at less than fair value.
The weighted average fair values of options granted during 1998, 1999 and
2000 were $628, $3061, and $3018 per share, respectively, using the Black-
Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: no expected
dividends, 895% volatility in 1998, 994% volatility in 1999, and 111%
volatility in 2000, expected life of the options of five years in 1998, 1999 and
2000 and a risk-free interest rate of 60% for 1998 and 1999, and 50% for the
year 2000. Had compensation cost for the Company stock-based compensation plan
been determined based upon the fair value of options on the grant dates,
consistent with the provisions of SFAS 123, the Company 1998, 1999 and 2000
pro forma net income would have been as follows in thousands, except per share

Our customers are primarily distributors and original equipment
manufacturers, who resell the Company products to end users. The Company
recognized revenue from the following significant customers and end users for
the years ended December 31 in thousands      Company                  1998   1999   2000

Although the Company generally uses standard parts and components for its
products, many key components are purchased from sole or single source vendors
for which alternative sources may not currently be available. The identification
and utilization of new suppliers for such items could adversely effect the
Company future operating results.
36  The Company is exposed to potential concentrations of credit risk from its
accounts receivable with its various customers and receivables are concentrated
in customers in the telecommunications industry. To reduce this risk, the
Company has a policy of assessing the creditworthiness of its customers and
monitors the aging of its accounts receivable for potential uncollectable
accounts.
10. Employee Benefit Plan
In May 1996, the Company adopted a defined contribution employee benefit plan
the 401k Plan under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code which is
available to all employees who meet the 401k Plan eligibility requirements.
Employees may contribute up to the maximum limits allowed by the Internal
Revenue Code. The Company may make discretionary employer matching contributions
to the 401k Plan. The Company made no contributions to the 401k Plan in
1998, 1999 or 2000. 11. Commitments
The Company leases office space under various noncancelable-operating leases
that expire through 2009. Future obligations under these leases are as follows
in thousands           Year ending December 31:
2001.    $ 1,991
2002.     2,111

2004.     2,311
2005.     2,115
Thereafter.     1,927
$12,655
The Company records rent expense under noncancelable operating leases using the
straight-line method after consideration of increases in rental payments over
the lease term, and records the difference between actual payments and rent
expense as deferred rent concessions.
Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 totaled
$555,483, $977,889 and $1,533,801, respectively.
