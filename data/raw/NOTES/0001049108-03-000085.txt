FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA     INDEPENDENT
AUDITORS REPORT
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, Inc. We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2002 and 2001, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2002. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at .
These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, such
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, Inc. and subsidiaries at
December31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31,
2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein. 
As discussed in Notes 2 and
8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets effective January 1, 2002
due to adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION Dollar
Thrifty Automotive Group, Inc. DTG is the successor to Pentastar
Transportation Group, Inc. Prior to December23, 1997, DTG was a wholly
owned subsidiary of Chrysler Corporation, now known as DaimlerChrysler
Corporation such entity and its subsidiaries and members of its affiliated
group are hereinafter referred to as DaimlerChrysler. On
December23, 1997, DTG completed an initial public offering of all its
outstanding common stock owned by DaimlerChrysler together with additional
shares issued by DTG. DTGs
significant wholly owned subsidiaries include Dollar Rent A Car Systems, Inc.,
which was renamed DTG Operations, Inc. on December 2, 2002 in connection with
DTGs reorganization, which was effective January 1, 2003 Note 17,
Thrifty, Inc., Rental Car Finance Corp. RCFC and Dollar Thrifty
Funding Corp. DTFC. DTG Operations, Inc. is herein referred to as
Dollar for reporting purposes since this legal entity operated as
Dollar for each of the three years presented. Thrifty, Inc. is the
parent company to Thrifty Car Sales and Thrifty Rent-A-Car System, Inc., which
is the parent company to Thrifty Canada Ltd. TCL individually and
collectively referred to as Thrifty. Dollar and Thrifty were
acquired in 1990 and 1989, respectively. The acquisitions were accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting and the purchase prices were allocated
to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair
values, which are reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. RCFC and DTFC are special purpose financing entities, which were
formed in 1995 and 1998, respectively, and are appropriately consolidated with
DTG and subsidiaries. RCFC and DTFC are each separate legal entities whose
assets are not available to satisfy any claims of creditors of DTG or any of its
other subsidiaries. The term the Company is used to refer to DTG and
subsidiaries, individually or collectively, as the context may require.
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 2. SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature
of Business - Dollar and Thrifty are engaged in the business of
the daily rental of vehicles to business and leisure customers through
company-owned stores and in the business of leasing vehicles to their
franchisees for use in the daily vehicle rental business throughout the United
States and Canada. Dollar and Thrifty are also involved in selling vehicle
rental franchises worldwide and providing sales and marketing, reservations,
data processing systems, insurance and other services to their franchisees. RCFC
and DTFC provide vehicle financing services to Dollar and Thrifty. Estimates
- - The preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash
and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents include cash on
hand and on deposit, including highly liquid investments with initial maturities
of three months or less. Restricted
Cash and Investments - Restricted cash and investments are
restricted for the acquisition of vehicles and other specified uses under the
rental car asset backed note indenture and other agreements Note9. These
funds are primarily held in a highly rated money market fund with investments
primarily in government and corporate obligations with a dollar-weighted average
maturity not to exceed 60 days, as permitted by the indenture. Restricted cash
and investments are excluded from cash and cash equivalents. Interest earned on
restricted cash and investments was $3,200,000, $3,531,000 and $3,624,000, for
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 43 Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts - An allowance for doubtful accounts is
generally established during the period in which receivables are recorded. The
allowance is maintained at a level deemed appropriate based on loss experience
and other factors affecting collectibility. Revenue-Earning
Vehicles - Revenue-earning vehicles are stated at cost, net of
related discounts. The Company generally purchases 75% to 85% of its vehicles
for which residual values are determined by depreciation rates that are
established and guaranteed by the manufacturers Program Vehicles.
The remaining 15% to 25% of the Companys vehicles are purchased without
the benefit of a manufacturer residual value guaranty program Non-Program
Vehicles. For these Non-Program Vehicles, the Company must estimate what
the residual values of these vehicles will be at the expected time of disposal
to determine monthly depreciation rates. The Company continually evaluates
estimated residual values. Differences between actual residual values and those
estimated by the Company result in a gain or loss on disposal and are recorded
as an adjustment to depreciation expense. Depreciation rates generally range
from approximately 067% to 310% per month. Property
and Equipment - Property and equipment are recorded at cost and
are depreciated or amortized using principally the straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets. Estimated useful lives range from
ten to thirty years for buildings and improvements and three to seven years for
furniture and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lives of
the related leases. Software
- Software is recorded at cost and is amortized using the
straight-line method primarily over five years. The remaining useful life of all
software is evaluated annually to assess whether events and circumstances
warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period. Goodwill - The excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of net assets
acquired is recorded as goodwill. In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, goodwill is no longer amortized but instead tested for
impairment at least annually Note 8. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on
January 1, 2002, goodwill was amortized using the straight-line method over
forty and twenty year periods. Long-Lived
Assets - The Company reviews the value of long-lived assets,
including software, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based upon
estimated future cash flows. In connection with the planned reorganization Note
17, Thrifty recorded a writeoff of $1,929,000 in 2002 for certain software
costs, which will not be utilized. Accounts
Payable - Disbursements in excess of bank balances of $16,713,000
and $13,740,000 are included in accounts payable at December31, 2002 and
2001, respectively. Derivative
Instruments - The Company uses SFAS No. 133 Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and its amendments which
establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for
hedging activities. It requires that all derivatives be recognized as either
assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and be measured at
fair value. In June 2002 and March 2001, the Company entered into interest rate
swap agreements, which qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133
Note 10.     44 Public
Liability and Property Damage - Provisions for public liability
and property damage on self-insured claims are made by charges primarily to
direct vehicle and operating expense. Accruals for such charges are based upon
actuarially determined evaluations of estimated ultimate liabilities on reported
and unreported claims, prepared on at least an annual basis by an independent
actuary. Historical data related to the amount and timing of payments for
self-insured claims is utilized in preparing the actuarial evaluations. The
accrual for public liability and property damage claims is discounted based upon
the independently prepared, actuarially determined estimated timing of payments
to be made in the future. Management reviews the actual timing of payments as
compared with the annual actuarial estimate of timing of payments and has
determined that there have been no material differences in the timing of
payments for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2002. Foreign
Currency Translation - Foreign assets and liabilities are
translated using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date, and
results of operations are translated using an average rate for the period.
Translation adjustments are accumulated and reported as a component of
stockholders equity and comprehensive income. Revenue
Recognition - Revenues from vehicle rentals are recognized as
earned on a daily basis under the related rental contracts with customers.
Revenues from leasing vehicles to franchisees are principally under operating
leases with fixed monthly payments and are recognized as earned over the lease
terms. Revenues from fees and services include providing sales and marketing,
reservations, information systems and other services to franchisees. Revenues
from these services are generally based on a percentage of franchisee rental
revenue or upon providing reservations and are recognized as earned on a monthly
basis. Initial franchise fees, which are recorded to other revenues, are
recognized upon substantial completion of all material services and conditions
of the franchise sale, which coincides with the date of sale and commencement of
operations by the franchisee. Advertising
Costs - Advertising costs are primarily expensed as incurred. The
Company incurred advertising expense of $28,074,000, $28,781,000 and
$30,166,000, for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Thriftys
primary advertising is conducted by an unconsolidated affiliated entity, Thrifty
Rent-A-Car System, Inc. National Advertising Committee Thrifty National
Ad in which Thrifty has no ownership or control. Thrifty made payments of
$4,154,000, $3,447,000 and $2,983,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, to
Thrifty National Ad to support funding of advertising campaigns, which are
included in advertising costs. Thrifty also received reimbursement from Thrifty
National Ad for administrative services performed of $2,565,000, $2,757,000 and
$2,647,000 during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, which are recorded as
offsets to selling, general and administrative expense. Environmental
Costs - The Companys operations include the storage of
gasoline in underground storage tanks at certain company-owned stores.
Liabilities incurred in connection with the remediation of accidental fuel
discharges are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred
and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Income
Taxes - U.S. operating results are included in the Companys
consolidated U.S. income tax returns. The Company has provided for income taxes
on its separate taxable income or loss and other tax attributes. Deferred income
taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting
basis and the tax basis of the Companys assets and liabilities. A
valuation allowance is recorded for deferred income tax assets when management
determines it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.     45 Earnings
Per Share - Basic earnings per share EPS is
computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is based on the combined weighted
average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding which
include, where appropriate, the assumed exercise of options. In computing
diluted EPS, the Company has utilized the treasury stock method. Stock-Based
Compensation - The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board
APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. Compensation cost for stock options, if any, is measured as the
excess of the quoted market price of the Companys stock at the date of
grant over the amount the grantee must pay to acquire the stock. Compensation
cost for shares issued under performance share plans is recorded based upon the
current market value of the Companys stock at the end of each period. The
Company has provided the disclosure only requirements of SFAS No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, through December 31, 2002. Effective
January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 changing
from the intrinsic value-based method to the fair value-based method of
accounting for stock-based compensation, electing the prospective treatment
option, which will require recognition as compensation expense for all future
employee awards granted, modified or settled as allowed under SFAS No. 148,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and
Disclosure, an amendment of SFAS No. 123. New
Accounting Standards - In June 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB approved the issuance of SFAS No141,
Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. SFAS No141 requires that the purchase method of
accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001.
SFAS No. 141 also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are
required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill and those
acquired intangible assets that are required to be included in goodwill.
Effective January 1, 2002, SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill no longer be
amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142
also requires recognized intangible assets to be amortized over their respective
estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment. Any recognized intangible
asset determined to have an indefinite useful life will not be amortized, but
instead tested for impairment in accordance with the standard until its life is
determined to no longer be indefinite. The
Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142 as required on
January 1, 2002, with the exception of the earlier adoption of the requirement
to use the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001. On January 1, 2002, the Company ceased amortization of
goodwill. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company completed its
transitional goodwill impairment test in accordance with SFAS No. 142 for each
reporting unit and determined that goodwill was not impaired. Additionally,
during the second quarter, the Company completed the annual impairment test of
goodwill for 2002 and concluded goodwill was not impaired. The Company will
complete the annual impairment test on goodwill during the second quarter of
each year unless circumstances arise that require more frequent testing. In
June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations which addresses financial accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the
associated asset retirement costs. It applies to legal obligations associated
with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition,
construction, development and or the normal operation of a long-lived asset,
except for certain obligations of lessees. This statement is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The
Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143 as required on January 1, 2003.
Adoption of SFAS No. 143 is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated
financial statements of the Company.     
46 In
August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which was effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS
No. 144 as required on January 1, 2002. This standard had no effect on the
Companys consolidated financial statements upon adoption. In
June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement supersedes Emerging
Issues Task Force EITF No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for
Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity.
Under this statement, a liability or a cost associated with a disposal or exit
activity is recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred rather than
at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan as required under
EITF No. 94-3. The provisions of this statement are effective for exit or
disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with early
adoption permitted. Since the Company formally communicated the reorganization
plans in December 2002 Note 17, the Company applied the provisions of EITF No.
94-3 rather than electing to early adopt SFAS No. 146. Differences in accounting
treatment between these two standards were not material as it related to the
Companys reorganization. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
146 as required on January 1, 2003. Adoption of SFAS No. 146 is not expected to
have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. In
November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. This interpretation elaborates on
the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its
obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also requires a
guarantor to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the
fair value of the obligation it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The
initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of the interpretation are
applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified beginning in
2003. The disclosure requirements are effective for interim or annual financial
statements beginning on December 31, 2002. Reclassifications
- - Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2001 and 2000 consolidated
financial statements to conform to the classifications used in 2002. 3. ACQUISITIONS During
2002, Thrifty acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of
thirty-one locations from former franchisees, the largest being the Boston,
Denver, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. airport locations. Additionally, Dollar
acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from a former franchisee
in Louisville, Kentucky. During 2001, Thrifty acquired certain assets and
assumed certain liabilities of nineteen locations from four former franchisees,
the largest being the Dallas and San Francisco airport locations. During 2000,
Dollar acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of eleven
locations from three former franchisees, the largest being the San Antonio,
Atlanta and Memphis airport locations. Total cash paid, net of cash acquired,
for these acquisitions was $261,000, $2,271,000 and $10,097,000 in 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively. Each of these transactions has been accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting and operating results of the acquirees from
the dates of acquisition, which are not material in each year presented, are
included in the consolidated statements of income of the Company.     47 4. RECEIVABLES Receivables consist of the following:

are generally guaranteed by franchisees. Financing receivables arise from direct financing and sales-type leases of vehicles with franchisees.
These receivables principally have terms
up to one year and are collateralized by the vehicles. Direct financing and
sales-type lease receivables are presented net of unearned income of $619,000
and $628,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Due

and Thrifty entered into U.S. vehicle supply agreements with DaimlerChrysler,
which commenced with the 1997 model year and expired in July 2001. In June 2000,
the Company entered into a new vehicle supply agreement with DaimlerChrysler,
which enabled the Company to acquire revenue-earning vehicles beginning with the
2002 model year through the 2006 model year. In October 2002, the Company
finalized a new vehicle supply agreement the VSA with
DaimlerChrysler. The VSA enables the Company to acquire revenue-earning vehicles
through the 2007 48 model year. Under the VSA, the Company is required to purchase
at least 75% of its vehicles from DaimlerChrysler until a certain minimum level
is reached, of which 80% will be Program Vehicles and 20% will be Non-Program
Vehicles. Under the terms of the VSA, Dollar and Thrifty will advertise and
promote DaimlerChrysler products exclusively, and the Company will receive
promotional payments from DaimlerChrysler for each model year. Purchases of
revenue-earning vehicles from DaimlerChrysler were $2,820,480,000, $2,499,355,000 and
$2,290,430,000 during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Vehicle
acquisition terms provide for guaranteed residual values in the U.S. or buybacks
in Canada on the majority of vehicles, under specified conditions. Guaranteed
residual and buyback payments received are included in proceeds from sales of
revenue-earning vehicles. Additionally, the Company receives promotional
payments and other incentives primarily related to the disposal of
revenue-earning vehicles, which amounts are reflected as offsets to direct
vehicle and operating expense. Promotional payments are primarily amortized on
the straight-line basis over the respective model year to which the promotional
payments relate. The Company also receives interest reimbursement for Program
Vehicles while at auction and for certain delivery related interest costs, which
amounts are reflected in interest expense, net. Amounts recorded from
DaimlerChrysler for guaranteed residual value program
payments, promotional payments, interest reimbursement and other incentives
totaled $559,696,000, $474,602,000 and $395,694,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Buyback payments received from the Canadian subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler were
$80,197,000, $78,749,000 and $81,222,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The
Company acquires some vehicles from other manufacturers, the majority of which
are subject to guaranteed buyback at established values by the manufacturers.
Rent expense for vehicles leased from other vehicle manufacturers and third
parties under operating leases was $8,121,000, $20,905,000 and $28,493,000 for

Revolving Credit Facility
The
Company has a five-year, $215,000,000 Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility
the Revolver that expires August 2005. The Revolver originally
provided sublimits up to $190,000,000 for letters of credit and up to
$70,000,000 for working capital borrowings. As of December31, 2002, the
Company is required to pay a 0375% commitment fee on the unused available line,
a 200% letter of credit fee on the aggregate amount of outstanding letters of
credit and a 0125% letter of credit issuance fee. Interest rates on loans under
the Revolver are, at the option of the Company, based on the prime, federal
funds or Eurodollar rates and are payable quarterly. The Revolver is
collateralized by a first priority lien on substantially all material
non-vehicle assets of the Company. The Revolver contains various restrictive
covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios consisting of
minimum net worth, adjusted EBITDA, fixed charge, leverage and interest coverage
ratios and the restriction of cash dividends and share repurchases. The Company
is in compliance with all covenants. In December 2002, the Company amended the 53 Revolver to increase the sublimit for letters of credit from $190 million to
$215 million, while retaining the $70 million sublimit on working capital borrowings
and the total Revolver commitment of $215 million. In early 2003, the Company completed an
amendment of the Revolver affecting a financial covenant, which also included limiting
expenditures for non-vehicle capital assets and franchisee acquisitions if certain
covenant levels are not maintained. The Company had
letters of credit of $168,168,000 and $60,294,000 and no working capital
borrowings outstanding under the Revolver at December31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. 10. DERIVATIVE
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The
Company is exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates.
Consequently, the Company manages the financial exposure as part of its risk
management program, by striving to reduce the potentially adverse effects that
the potential volatility of the financial markets may have on the Companys
operating results. During March 2001, the Company entered into an interest rate
swap agreement the 2001 Swap to adjust the variable interest rate
on $350 million of asset backed notes to a fixed interest rate. The Swap, which
terminates in April 2006, constitutes a cash flow hedge and continues to satisfy
the criteria for hedge accounting. During June 2002, the Company entered into an
interest rate swap agreement the 2002 Swap to convert the variable
interest rate on $175 million of asset backed notes to a fixed interest rate.
The 2002 Swap, which terminates in August 2005, also constitutes a cash flow
hedge and satisfies the criteria for hedge accounting. The Company reflects
these swaps in its statement of financial position as liabilities at fair market
value, which was approximately $41,988,000 and $11,264,000 at December 31, 2002
and 2001, respectively. The
Company recorded the related loss of $18,855,000 for 2002 and $6,758,000 for
2001, which is net of income taxes, in total comprehensive income on the
statement of stockholders equity. Deferred gains and losses are recognized
in operations as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period in which
the related interest payments being hedged are recognized. The Company is unable
to reasonably estimate the net amount of the existing deferred income or loss at
December 31, 2002 that is expected to be reclassified into operations within the
next twelve months. 11. 
STOCKHOLDERS RIGHTS PLAN On
July23, 1998, the Company adopted a stockholders rights plan. The
rights were issued on August3, 1998, to stockholders of record on that
date, and will expire on August3, 2008, unless earlier redeemed, exchanged
or amended by the Board of Directors. The
plan provides for the issuance of one right for each outstanding share of the
Companys common stock. Upon the acquisition by a person or group of 15% or
more of the Companys outstanding common stock, the rights generally will
become exercisable and allow the stockholder, other than the acquiring person or
group, to acquire common stock at a discounted price. The
plan also includes an exchange option after the rights become exercisable. The
Board of Directors may effect an exchange of part or all of the rights, other
than rights that have become void, for shares of the Companys common stock
for each right. The Board of Directors may redeem all rights for $01 per right,
generally at any time prior to the rights becoming exercisable. The
issuance of the rights had no dilutive effect on the number of common shares
outstanding and did not affect earnings per share. 54 12. EARNINGS

BENEFIT PLANS Employee Benefit Plans
The
Company sponsors a retirement savings plan that incorporates the salary
reduction provisions of Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code and covers
substantially all employees of the Company meeting specific age and length of
service requirements. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company announced a
suspension of the matching of employee contributions to the 401k plan.
However, due to improved operating performance, the Company reinstated the
matching provisions in December 2002 and retroactively matched 100% up to 6% of
the employees eligible compensation, subject to statutory limitations, of
which 50% is in cash and 50% is in company stock. The Company stock match is
immediately available for transfer or sale at the employees discretion.
Employee contributions were matched in cash by the Company to the extent of 75%
up to 6% of the employees eligible compensation in 2001, and 50% up to 6%
in 2000. Contributions expensed by the Company totaled $4,066,000, $2,933,000
and $2,264,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.     55 For
2003, the Company expects to continue to match 100% up to 6% of the
employees eligible compensation of which 50% will be in cash and 50% in
company stock. Included
in accrued liabilities at December 31, 2002 and 2001 is $2,038,000 and
$2,892,000, respectively, for employee health claims, which are self-insured by
the Company. The accrual includes amounts for incurred and incurred but not
reported claims. The
Company has bonus and profit sharing plans for all employees based on company
performance. Expense related to these plans was $14,835,000 in 2002 and
$11,260,000 in 2000. No expense was recorded in 2001 relating to these plans. Deferred Compensation and Retirement Plans
The
Company has deferred compensation and retirement plans providing key executives
with the opportunity to defer compensation, including related investment income.
Under the deferred compensation plan, the Company contributes up to 7% of
participant cash compensation. Participants become fully vested under both the
deferred compensation and retirement plans after five years of service. The
total of participant deferrals in the deferred compensation and retirement
plans, which are reflected in accrued liabilities, was $18,336,000 and
$17,375,000 as of December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Expense related
to these plans totaled $2,166,000, $735,000 and $2,140,000 in 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively. Long-Term Incentive Plan
The
Company has a long-term incentive plan LTIP for employees and
non-employee directors under which the Human Resources and Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company is authorized to provide for
grants in the form of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance share awards and other
stock-based incentive awards. The exercise prices for nonqualified stock options
are equal to the fair market value of the Companys common stock at the
date of grant, except for the initial grant, which was made at the initial
public offering price. The options vest in three equal annual installments
commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date and have a term not
exceeding ten years from the date of grant. In May 2000, an additional 2,400,000
shares were approved by the shareholders for issuance under the LTIP. At
December 31, 2002, the Companys common stock outstanding authorized for
issuance under the LTIP was 4,859,989 shares, with a share addition provision
that allows for the number of shares reserved to increase by 10% of any newly
issued shares. Performance
share awards are granted to Company officers and certain key employees. Such
awards established a target number of shares that vest in three equal annual
installments commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date. The number
of performance shares ultimately earned is expected to range from zero to 200%
of the target award, depending on the level of corporate performance each year
against annual profit targets. Any performance share installments not earned as
of a given anniversary date are forfeited. Performance shares earned are
delivered based upon vesting of the grant, provided the grantee is then employed
by the Company. Values of the performance shares earned will be recognized as
compensation expense over the period the shares are earned. The Company
recognized compensation costs of $2,538,000 in 2002 and $658,000 in 2000, for
performance share awards. During 2001, there were no performance shares earned
and, thus, no compensation expense recognized. On January 31, 2001, performance
shares earned in 1998, 1999 and 2000, net of forfeitures, totaling approximately
168,000 shares vested and were settled through the purchase of common stock for
the treasury totaling $3,615,000. These shares were ultimately transferred to
the deferred compensation plan by the Company for the benefit of the employees.     56 The
status of the Companys stock option plan is summarized below:

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
As
stated in Note2, the Company followed the intrinsic value approach
prescribed in APB Opinion No25 in accounting for its employee stock plans
through December 31, 2002 and has provided the disclosure-only provisions of
SFAS No123. If the Company had elected to recognize compensation cost
based on the fair value of the options granted at the grant date as prescribed
by SFAS No123, net income for 2002, 2001 and 2000 would have been reduced
from the amounts as reported of $46,831,000, $13,837,000 and $78,009,000 to the
pro forma amounts of $44,157,000, $11,551,000 and $75,468,000, respectively.
Diluted earnings per share as reported of $188, $057 and $318 would have been
reduced to the pro forma amounts of $177, $047 and $308 for 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively.     57 The
pro forma amounts noted reflect the portion of the estimated fair value of
awards earned in 2002, 2001 and 2000 based on the vesting period of the options. The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was used to estimate the fair value of the
options at the date of grant for purposes of the pro forma amounts noted. The
following assumptions were used for 2002: weighted-average expected life of the
awards of five years, volatility factor of 5457% and risk-free interest rate of
446%. The following assumptions were used for 2001: weighted-average expected
life of the awards of six years, volatility factor of 5643% and risk-free
interest rate of 433%. The following assumptions were used for 2000:
weighted-average expected life of the awards of five years, volatility factor of
375% and risk-free interest rate of 596%. There were no dividend payments made
in 2002, 2001 or 2000. Based on this model, the weighted-average fair value of
options granted during 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $1202, $696 and $813 per
share, respectively. The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected stock volatility. Because the
Companys employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from traded options, and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in managements
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of the employee stock options. The
following table summarizes information regarding fixed stock options that were
outstanding at December31, 2002

59 The
Company has net operating loss carryforwards available in certain states to
offset future state taxable income. At December 31, 2002, the Company has
federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $136,000,000 available
to offset future taxable income in the U.S., which expire after 2017. At
December31, 2002, TCL has net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $10,635,000 available to offset future taxable income in Canada,
which expire through 2008. Valuation allowances have been established for the
total estimated future tax effect of the Canadian net operating losses and other
deferred tax assets, since management believes it is more likely than not that
such benefits will not be realized. The
Companys effective tax rate differs from the maximum U.S. statutory income
tax rate. The following summary reconciles taxes at the maximum U.S. statutory

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND FAIR VALUE INFORMATION Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist principally of restricted cash and investments and trade
receivables. The Company limits its exposure on restricted cash and investments
by investing in highly rated funds. Concentrations of credit risk with respect
to trade receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising
the Companys customer base and their dispersion across different
geographic areas. The
following estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined by
the Company using available market information and valuation methodologies. Cash
and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Investments, Receivables, Accounts
Payable, Accrued Liabilities and Public Liability and
Property Damage - The carrying amounts of these items are a
reasonable estimate of their fair value. Vehicle Debt
and Obligations - The fair value of floating-rate debt
approximates the carrying value as these instruments are at current market
interest rates. At December31, 2002, the fair value of the asset backed
notes with fixed interest rates, including the effect of the interest rate swaps
Note10, was greater than the carrying value by approximately
$57,433,000. Letters
of Credit - The estimated fair value of these items was $302,000
and $260,000 at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 60 16. 
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Concessions and Operating Leases The
Company has certain concession agreements principally with airports throughout
the United States and Canada. Typically, these agreements provide airport
terminal counter space in return for a minimum rent. In many cases, the
Companys subsidiaries are also obligated to pay insurance and maintenance
costs and additional rents generally based on revenues earned at the location.
Certain of the airport locations are operated by franchisees who are obligated
to make the required rent and concession fee payments under the terms of their
franchise arrangements with the Companys subsidiaries. The
Companys subsidiaries operate from various leased premises under operating
leases with terms up to 25years. Some of the leases contain renewal
options. Expenses
incurred under operating leases and concessions were as follows

Public Liability and Property Damage During
2002, the Company re-evaluated its insurance coverages on the majority of its
operations and became self-insured for public liability and property damage
claims up to certain policy limits. For 2001 and 2000, the majority of the
Companys operations had first dollar coverage from insurance carriers,
subject to certain policy limits, for public liability and property damage
claims. Prior to this insurance coverage, the Company was self-insured or had
policy deductibles up to certain limits. The accrual for public liability and
property damage includes amounts for incurred and incurred but not reported
losses. Such liabilities are necessarily based on actuarially determined
estimates and management believes that the amounts accrued are adequate. At
December31, 2002 and 2001, these amounts have been discounted at 20% and
37%, assumed risk free rate, respectively, based upon the actuarially
determined estimated timing of payments to be made in future years. Discounting
resulted in reducing the accrual for public liability and property damage by
$1,244,000 and $1,542,000 at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Estimated future payments of public liability and property damage as of

62 Contingencies Various
claims and legal proceedings have been asserted or instituted against the
Company, including some purporting to be class actions, and some which demand
large monetary damages or other relief which could result in significant
expenditures. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of
individual matters is not predictable with assurance. The Company is also
subject to potential liability related to environmental matters. The Company
establishes reserves for litigation and environmental matters when the loss is
probable and reasonably estimable. It is reasonably possible that the final
resolution of some of these matters may require the Company to make
expenditures, in excess of established reserves, over an extended period of time
and in a range of amounts that cannot be reasonably estimated. The term
reasonably possible is used herein to mean that the chance of a
future transaction or event occurring is more than remote but less than likely.
Although the final resolution of any such matters could have a material effect
on the Companys consolidated operating results for the particular
reporting period in which an adjustment of the estimated liability is recorded,
the Company believes that any resulting liability should not materially affect
its consolidated financial position. Other The
Company is party to a data processing services agreement which requires payments
totaling $5,618,000 in 2003, $5,373,000 in 2004 and $1,012,000 in 2005. Additionally, the
Company has a telecommunications contract which will require payments totaling
$5,040,000 through February 2004. In
addition to the letters of credit described in Note9, the Company had
letters of credit totaling $3,021,000 and $1,741,000 and guarantee obligations
totaling $995,000 and $862,000 at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. At
December31, 2002, the Company had outstanding vehicle purchase commitments
of approximately $710,419,000. 17. BUSINESS
SEGMENTS The
Company had two reportable segments: Dollar and Thrifty. These reportable
segments were strategic business units that offered different products and
services. They were managed separately based on the fundamental differences in
their operations. Dollar operated company-owned stores located at major airports
and derived the majority of its revenues by providing rental vehicles and
services directly to rental customers. Thrifty operated primarily through
franchisees serving both the airport and local markets, and it derived the
majority of its revenues from franchising fees and services including vehicle
leasing. The
accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates segment
performance based on profit and loss from operations before income taxes. In
December 2002, the Company announced a new corporate operating structure which
became effective January 1, 2003. This new structure will realign the Company
from a brand structure to a functional structure combining the management of
operations and administrative functions for both the Dollar and Thrifty brands.
Due to the realignment, the Company will no longer report Dollar and Thrifty as
operating segments. Consistent with the new structure, management will make
business and operating decisions on an overall company basis. Financial results
will not be available by brand. 63 Included
in the consolidated financial statements are the following amounts relating to
geographic locations:
