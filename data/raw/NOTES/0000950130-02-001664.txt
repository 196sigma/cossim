The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. These principles permit
choices among alternatives and require numerous estimates of financial matters.
The Company believes the accounting principles chosen are appropriate under the
circumstances, and that the estimates, judgments and assumptions involved in
its financial reporting are reasonable.
The Company management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of
the financial information presented in its financial statements. It maintains a
system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance
that Company employees comply with stated policies and procedures, that the
Company assets are safeguarded and that its financial reports are fairly
presented. On a regular basis, the Company financial management discusses
internal accounting controls and financial reporting matters with its
independent auditors and its Audit Committee, composed solely of independent
outside directors. The independent auditors and the Audit Committee also meet
privately to discuss and assess the Company accounting controls and financial
reporting.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Board of Directors of
AK Steel Holding Corporation  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AK Steel
Holding Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 2001, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31,
2000 and 2001, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
dollars in millions, except per share amounts 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation: AK Steel Holding Corporation AK Holding and its
wholly-owned subsidiary AK Steel Corporation AK Steel, and together with AK
Holding, the Company were formed effective March 29, 1994 as a result of the
recapitalization of Armco Steel Company, L.P.
There is no summarized financial information included for AK Steel because
there is no substantial difference in the operations of AK Steel and AK Holding
and because AK Steel indebtedness for borrowed money is fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by AK Holding. AK Holding has no independent
operations.
As described more fully in Note 2, the Company completed a transaction on
September 30, 1999, whereby Armco Inc. Armco merged with and into AK Steel,
and AK Steel became the surviving company. The transaction was accounted for as
a pooling of interests and, therefore, the consolidated financial statements
presented herein reflect the combined financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of Armco and the Company as if they had been combined for all
periods presented. Prior to September 30, 1999, AK Steel and Armco, in the
normal course of business, entered into certain transactions for the purchase
and conversion of material. These intercompany transactions have been
eliminated in the accompanying financial statements. All references to the
number of common shares outstanding and per share amounts, except dividends per
share, have given effect to the Armco merger.
These financial statements consolidate the operations and accounts of the
Company and all subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling interest.
Further information about operating segments is included in Note 9.
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the
use of management estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported.
These estimates are based on historical experience and information that is
available to management about current events and actions the Company may take
in the future. Significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include
the carrying value of long-lived assets; valuation allowances for receivables,
inventories and deferred income tax assets; legal and environmental
liabilities; and assets and obligations related to employee benefit plans.
There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these
estimates.
Revenue Recognition: Revenue from sales of products is recognized at the
time title and the risks and rewards of ownership passes. This normally is when
the products are shipped to the customer, the sales price is fixed and
determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid
investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are of an
original maturity of three months or less.
Supplemental Disclosure of Cash Flow Information                           1999  2000  2001
Cash paid received during the period for:
Interest net of interest capitalized. $1143 $1271 $1397
Income   62  90  11  Supplemental Cash Flow Information Regarding Non-Cash Investing and
Financing Activities: The Company granted to certain employees shares of its
common stock with values, net of cancellations, of $108, $76 and $01 in
1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively, under its restricted stock award programs

1999, holders of the Company $3625 cumulative convertible preferred stock
converted their shares with a total redemption value of $1155 into common
stock and holders of Armco other preferred stock issues converted their
shares with a redemption value of $21 into common stock Note 2.
In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company received a distribution of shares
from Anthem Inc., its primary health insurance provider upon the
demutualization of that company. The shares had a fair value at the date
of receipt of $499, net of a liability established to provide compensation to
Company employees and retirees who contributed a small portion of the premiums
paid to the applicable insurance plans.
Accounts Receivable: The allowance for doubtful accounts was $50 and $84
at December 31, 2000 and 2001.
Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The
cost of the majority of inventories is measured on the last in, first out
LIFO method. Other inventories are measured principally at average cost and
consist mostly of foreign inventories and certain raw materials.                              2000  2001

During 2001, liquidation of LIFO layers generated income of $51.
Property, Plant and Equipment: Plant and equipment are depreciated under
the straight line method over their estimated lives ranging from 2 to 39 years.
The Company property, plant and equipment balances as of December 31, 2000
and 2001 are as follows                          2000    2001

The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets to
be held and used and long-lived assets to be disposed of when events and
circumstances warrant such a review. If the carrying value of a long-lived
asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which
the carrying value exceeds the fair market value less cost to dispose for
assets to be sold or abandoned. Fair market value is determined primarily using
the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk
involved.
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Statement No. 143, Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to establish
liabilities for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets. The Company will adopt the Statement in 2003, but has yet to
determine what effect, if any, adoption will have on its financial statements.

dollars in millions, except per share amounts  In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which addresses financial
accounting and reporting for impairment of long-lived assets to be held and
used, and of long-lived assets and components of an entity to be disposed of.
The Company adopted the Statement as of January 1, 2002, as required, but does
not expect the Statement will have a material effect on its financial
statements.
Investments: The Company has investments in associated companies that are
accounted for under the equity method. Because the operations of these
companies are integrated with its basic steelmaking operations, the Company
includes its proportionate share of the income loss of these associated
companies in cost of products sold in its consolidated statements of income.
The Company has a note receivable of $350 due from an entity in which it
holds an indirect equity interest, Combined Metals of Chicago LLC. The note is
subordinate to outstanding bank indebtedness of the entity. In the first
quarter of 2002, the Company provided a $40 letter of credit to support a
portion of the entity bank indebtedness proportionate to the company
indirect equity investment.
The Company investment in AFSG Holdings, Inc. represents the carrying
value of its discontinued insurance and finance leasing businesses, which have
been largely liquidated. The activities of the remaining operating companies
are being runoff and the group is accounted for as a discontinued operation
under the liquidation basis of accounting, whereby future cash inflows and
outflows are considered. In the fourth quarter of 2001, AFSG Holdings
distributed $300 of excess funds to the Company, which reduced the Company
carrying value of its AFSG investment. The Company is under no obligation to
support the operations or liabilities of this group.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill and other intangible assets
primarily consist of goodwill recorded in connection with Armco acquisition
of Cyclops Industries, Inc. on April 24, 1992. This goodwill is being amortized
using the straight-line method over 40 years. Goodwill and other intangible
assets were also acquired in Armco purchase of Douglas Dynamics, L.L.C. on
July 2, 1991. These assets are being amortized over their estimated useful
lives, the majority of which do not exceed 17 years. Amortization expense for
both goodwill and other intangible assets was $61 in each of the years 1999
and 2000, and $55 in 2001. At December 31, 2000 and 2001, accumulated
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was $548 and $395,
respectively.
The Company assesses whether its goodwill and other intangible assets are
impaired as required by Statement No. 121, Accounting for Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, based on an
evaluation of undiscounted projected cash flows through the remaining
amortization period. If an impairment exists, the amount of such impairment is
determined based on the estimated fair value of the asset. Statement No. 144
supercedes Statement No. 121 effective January 1, 2002.
In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. Statement No. 142 requires that goodwill no longer be
amortized to earnings, but instead be reviewed annually for impairment. The
Company adopted Statement No. 142 as of January 1, 2002 and has begun the
transition process of identifying its reporting units, allocating goodwill and
determining fair values. The Statement allows the Company until June 30, 2002
to complete this initial stage, which determines whether impairment exists, and
until the end of the year to determine the final effect adoption will have on
its financial statements. The Company currently does not know if an impairment
will be necessary. In 2001, $40 of the above amortization expense was related
to goodwill.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Accounting: Under its method of
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the Company
recognizes into income, as a fourth quarter adjustment, any
28             AK STEEL HOLDING CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
dollars in millions, except per share amounts
unrecognized actuarial net gains or losses that exceed 10% of the larger of
benefit obligations or plan assets. Amounts inside this 10% corridor are
amortized over the average remaining service life of active plan participants.
Actuarial net gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from any of
the many assumptions used to value the plans. Differences between the expected
and actual returns on plan assets and changes in interest rates, which affect
the discount rates used, can have a significant impact on the calculation of
pension net gains and losses from year to year. For other postretirement
benefit plans, increases in healthcare trend rates that outpace discount rates
could cause unrecognized net losses to increase to the point that an
outside-the-corridor charge would be necessary. By immediately recognizing net
gains and losses outside the corridor, the Company accounting method limits
the amounts by which balance sheet assets and liabilities differ from economic
net assets or obligations related to the plans. During 2001, the combination of
a 6% loss on its pension plan assets, and a decrease in the discount rate from
8% to 725%, caused the Company to recognize, in the fourth quarter of 2001, a
non-cash pre-tax pension charge of $1940. In addition, because the decline in
asset value also led to the pension plans becoming underfunded, the Company
recorded a non-cash after-tax reduction in equity of approximately $1634.

research and development activities aimed at improving existing products and
manufacturing processes and developing new products and processes. Research and
development costs are recorded as expense when incurred. Research and
development costs incurred in 1999, 2000 and 2001 were $168, $153 and $139,
respectively.
Concentrations of Credit Risk: The Company is primarily a producer of
flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steels and steel products, which
are sold to a number of markets, including automotive, industrial machinery and
equipment, construction, power distribution and appliances. During 2001, 18% of
the Steel Operations' net sales were to General Motors Corporation. The Company
sells domestically to customers primarily in the Midwestern and Eastern United
States, while approximately 11% of sales are to foreign customers, primarily in
Canada, Mexico and Western Europe. Approximately 35% of trade receivables
outstanding at December 31, 2001 are due from businesses associated with the
U.S. automotive industry. Except in a few situations where the risk warrants
it, collateral is not required on trade receivables; and while it believes its
trade receivables will be collected, the Company anticipates that in the event
of default it would follow normal collection procedures.
Financial Instruments: Investments in debt securities are classified as
held-to-maturity because the Company has the positive intent and ability to
hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are stated at
amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts to maturity. Investments in equity securities are classified as
available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value,
with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive
income. Realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities are
computed based upon initial cost adjusted for any other than temporary declines
in fair value. The Company has no investments that are considered to be trading
securities.
The carrying value of the Company financial instruments does not differ
materially from their estimated fair value primarily based on quoted market
prices at the end of 2000 and 2001 with the exception of the Company
long-term debt. At December 31, 2001, the fair value of the Company long-term
debt, including current maturities, was approximately $1,4097. This amount was
determined primarily from quoted market prices. The fair value estimate was
based on pertinent information available to management as of December 31, 2001.
Management is not aware of any significant factors that would materially alter
this estimate since that date. The fair value of the Company long-term debt,
including current maturities, at December 31, 2000 was approximately $1,3583.
The Company is a party to derivative instruments that are designated and
qualify as hedges under Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities and related pronouncements. The Company
objective in using such instruments is to protect its earnings and cash flows
from fluctuations in the fair value of selected commodities and currencies. The
Company has not entered into derivative instruments that do not qualify as
hedges.
30             AK STEEL HOLDING CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
dollars in millions, except per share amounts  In the ordinary course of business, the Company income and cash flows may
be affected by fluctuations in the price of certain commodities used in its
production processes. The Company generally cannot recover higher energy and
raw material costs in its selling prices. For certain commodities where such
exposure exists, the Company uses cash settled commodity price swaps, with a
duration of up to three years, to hedge the price of a portion of its natural
gas, nickel, aluminum and zinc requirements. The Company designates these swaps
as cash flow hedges and the resulting changes in their fair value are recorded
in other comprehensive income. Subsequent gains and losses are recognized into
income in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. As of
December 31, 2001, currently valued outstanding commodity hedges would result
in the reclassification into earnings of $200 in net-of-tax losses within the
next twelve months.
In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to
risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations on monies received from its
European subsidiaries and other customers invoiced in European currencies. In
order to mitigate this risk, the Company has entered into a series of
agreements for the forward sale of euros at fixed dollar rates. The forward
contracts are entered into with durations of up to a year. A typical contract
is used as a cash flow hedge for the period from when an order is taken to when
a sale is recognized, at which time it converts into a fair value hedge of a
euro-denominated receivable. As a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair
value of the derivative and the gains or losses on the foreign-denominated
receivables are recorded currently in other income and provide an offset to one
another.
The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments
and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for
undertaking various hedge transactions. In this documentation, the Company
specifically identifies the asset, liability, firm commitment or forecasted
transaction that has been designated as a hedged item and states how the
hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to that item. The
Company formally measures effectiveness of its hedging relationships both at
the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis. The Company discontinues hedge
accounting prospectively when it determines that the derivative is no longer
effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged
item; when the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; when it
is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur; when a hedged firm
commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment; or when
management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument
is no longer appropriate.

2. Merger with Armco Inc.
On September 30, 1999, the Company consummated the merger of Armco with and
into AK Steel. Armco was a leading producer of stainless and electrical steels
and, in addition, owned and operated a manufacturer of steel pipe and tubing
products, a manufacturer of snowplows and ice control products for four-wheel
drive light trucks, and an industrial park on the Houston, Texas ship channel.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
dollars in millions, except per share amounts  Effective with the merger, the Company paid cash and issued shares of its
common stock to convert the outstanding shares of two series of Armco
convertible preferred stock. In 1999, accrued dividends of $67 on these two
series of preferred stock are reported as minority interest on the consolidated
statements of income.
Historically, Armco did not provide for federal income taxes at full
statutory rates. However, to reflect its book tax rate in income from
continuing operations on a combined basis, the Company accrued additional
income tax expense of $175 for the first six months of 1999.
The following presents a reconciliation of previously reported results of AK
Holding and Armco to the results of the merged Company for the six months ended
June 30, 1999. Eliminations/other primarily reflects the elimination of
intercompany transactions, the additional accrual of income taxes, including
taxes on extraordinary losses and cumulative effect of the accounting change.
The adjustment in eliminations/other for stockholders' equity also includes
$2100 of cumulative credits for revaluation of the deferred tax asset.                      AK

Preferred Stock: The Company $3625 cumulative convertible preferred
stock ranks senior to its common stock with respect to dividends and upon
liquidation. The holders of this preferred stock are entitled to one vote per
share with respect to all matters to be voted upon by the stockholders of the
Company. Each share may be converted, at the holder option, into 26 shares
of the Company common stock. At the Company option, each share of preferred
stock may be redeemed at a price of $503625 per share until October 15, 2002,
after which, the redemption price is reduced to $50 per share. Upon
dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or
involuntary, holders of the $3625 preferred stock are entitled to a payment of
$50 per share plus accrued but unpaid dividends before payments can be made to
the holders of common stock. At December 31, 2000 and 2001, there were
authorized, issuable and outstanding 259,481 shares of $3625 preferred stock
with a $1 per share par value.
Common Stock: The holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends
when and as declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available
for distribution. The holders have one vote per share in respect of all matters
and are not entitled to preemptive rights.
Dividends: A common stock dividend of $0125 per share was paid in each
quarter of 2000. In each of the first two quarters of 2001, the Company paid a
common stock dividend of $00625 per share before suspending common stock
dividends for the final two quarters. In addition, from the fourth quarter of
1999 through the third quarter of 2001, the Company paid regular quarterly
dividends of $090625 per share on its $3625 preferred stock. In the fourth
quarter of 2001, the Company suspended the regular preferred stock dividend.
The declaration and payment of cash dividends on common and preferred stock is
subject to restrictions imposed by a covenant contained in the instruments
governing its outstanding senior debt. Common and preferred dividends were
reduced and ultimately suspended in 2001 because of the restrictions imposed by
this covenant. As of December 31, 2001, this covenant continues to preclude the
payment of any dividends.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
dollars in millions, except per share amounts  The preferred stock dividends are cumulative and, as such, holders of the
$3625 preferred stock are entitled to payment of all accrued, but unpaid
dividends, before payment of dividends to the holders of common stock. At
December 31, 2001, preferred stock dividends are in arrears $02 in the
aggregate or $090625 per share.
At its January 17, 2002 meeting, the Board of Directors did not declare a
quarterly dividend on either of its common or preferred stock because of the
covenant restriction described above.
Stockholder Rights Plan: On January 23, 1996, the Board of Directors
adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan pursuant to which it has issued one Preferred
Share Purchase Right collectively, the Rights for each share of common
stock outstanding. The Rights are generally not exercisable unless, and no
sooner than 10 business days after, any person or group acquires beneficial
ownership of 20% or more of the Company voting stock or announces a tender
offer that could result in the acquisition of 30% or more of such voting stock.
In addition, each Right entitles the holder, upon occurrence of certain
specified events, to purchase 1/200th of a share of Series A Junior Preferred
Stock Junior Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $65 per share. Each
share of Junior Preferred Stock, if and when issued, will entitle the holder to
200 votes in respect of all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of
common stock. Upon the occurrence of certain events, holders of the Rights
would be entitled to purchase either shares of the Company or an acquiring
entity at half of market value. The Rights are redeemable, under certain
circumstances, at any time prior to their expiration on January 23, 2006.
4. Common Stock Compensation
AK Steel Holding Corporation Stock Incentive Plan the SIP permits the
granting of nonqualified stock options and restricted stock awards to
directors, officers and key management employees of the Company. These
nonqualified option and restricted stock awards may be granted with respect to
an aggregate maximum of 11 million shares through the period ending December
31, 2007. The exercise price of each option may not be less than the market
price of the Company common stock on the date of the grant. Stock options
have a maximum term of 10 years and may not be exercised earlier than six
months following the date of grant or such other term as may be specified in
the award agreement. The nonqualified stock options vest at the rate of 33%
per year over three years. Generally, 25% of the shares covered by a restricted
stock award vest two years after the date of the award and an additional 25%
vest on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of the award.
Prior to the merger, Armco maintained plans under which stock options and
restricted stock awards were granted. Effective with the merger, Armco stock
options were converted into options to purchase the Company common stock,
adjusting the option price and number of shares by the same 3829 ratio used to
convert outstanding shares of Armco common stock at the time of the merger. In
addition, all unvested options vested. Other provisions of these options were
similar to those of the Company and did not change. All outstanding restricted
stock awards of Armco vested upon the effectiveness of the merger and the
shares were converted into the Company common stock.
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations in accounting for
the SIP and Armco award program. The compensation cost that has been charged
against income for the restricted stock awards issued under the SIP was $81 59 and $50 for 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The Company adopted the
pro forma disclosure requirements of Statement No. 123, Accounting for

dollars in millions, except per share amounts  Temporary differences represent the cumulative taxable or deductible amounts
recorded in the consolidated financial statements in different years than
recognized in the tax returns. The postretirement benefit difference includes
amounts expensed in the consolidated financial statements for health care, life
insurance and other postretirement benefits, which become deductible in the tax
return upon payment or funding in qualified trusts. Other temporary differences
represent principally various expenses accrued for financial reporting purposes
which are not deductible for tax reporting purposes until paid. The depreciable
assets temporary difference represents generally tax depreciation in excess of
financial statement depreciation. The inventory difference relates primarily to
differences in the LIFO reserve, reduced by tax overhead capitalized in excess
of book amounts.

At December 31, 2001 the Company had Alternative Minimum Tax AMT net
operating loss carryforwards of $7177 which, unless utilized, will expire in
the years 2002 through 2021. In addition, at December 31, 2001, the Company had
unused AMT credit carryforwards of $705, which may be used to offset future
regular income tax liabilities. These credits can be carried forward
indefinitely.
The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets
to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In estimating levels
of future taxable income, the Company has considered historical results of
operations in recent years and would, if necessary, consider the implementation
of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to generate future taxable
income. If future taxable income is less than the amount that has been assumed
in determining the deferred tax asset, then an increase in the valuation
reserve will be required, with a corresponding charge against income. On the
other hand, if future taxable income exceeds the level that has been assumed in
calculating the deferred tax asset, the valuation reserve could be reduced,
with a corresponding credit to income. The Company ability to utilize Armco
net operating loss, capital loss, and tax credit carryforwards as of the date
of the merger will be limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The
Company has recorded a valuation reserve for those carryforward amounts that
are expected to expire prior to being used as a result of the limits imposed by
Section 382.

The Company and the Internal Revenue Service have concluded the examinations
of federal income tax returns filed for the years 1994 through 1998. The
Company 1999 and 2000 returns are currently under examination. In addition,
in the normal course of business, the state and local tax returns of the
Company and its subsidiaries are routinely subjected to examination by various
taxing jurisdictions. However, the Company believes that the outcomes of these
examinations will not have any material adverse impact on the Company
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
The statute of limitations has lapsed with respect to Armco federal income
tax returns for 1997 and prior years, and as a result these returns are closed
to assessments of additional tax. However, the NOL carryforwards from these
years remain open to adjustment. Armco was in a cumulative NOL carryforward
position from 1983 through the date of the merger with the Company in September
1999. In addition, at the time of the merger, Armco had loss carryforwards that
were substantially in excess of the amounts that are expected to be used each
year after the merger, because of the limits on the loss utilization imposed by
Section 382. Consequently, the Company believes that any IRS audit adjustments
to the loss carryforwards would not be sufficient to reduce the carryovers
below the amounts for which a deferred tax benefit has been provided.

construct certain other fixed assets, which are pledged as collateral.
On January 14, 1999, Armco redeemed the entire $1110 outstanding principal
amount of its 9 3/8% Senior Notes Due 2000 at a price of 10175% of their
principal amount. The redemption resulted in an extraordinary loss of $28
$17 after taxes, or $002 per share.
On February 10, 1999, AK Steel issued $4500 principal amount of 7 7/8%
Senior Notes Due 2009 at 99623% of their principal amount. On April 1, 1999,
AK Steel used $3381 of the net proceeds from the sale of these notes to
finance the redemption of its 10 3/4% Senior Notes Due 2004 at a price of
104031% of their principal amount. The redemption resulted in an extraordinary

provides various health care and life insurance benefits to most retirees.
While the major pension plans are not fully funded, the Company would not be
obligated to make minimum funding contributions until at least 2003. Although
most retiree health and life insurance benefits are funded as claims are paid,
the Company has established a health care trust as a means of prefunding a
portion of these benefits.                            Pension Benefits   Other Benefits

participate in various defined contribution plans. Total expense related to
these plans was $115 in 1999, $126 in 2000 and $22 in 2001. The 2001 expense
was significantly lower because no variable matching contribution was payable
to non-represented employees for the year.
9. Segment Information
The Company Steel Operations currently consist of steel production and
finishing plants in Butler, Pennsylvania; Ashland, Kentucky; Coshocton,
Mansfield, Middletown, and Zanesville, Ohio; and Rockport, Indiana that produce
flat-rolled steels, including premium quality coated, cold-rolled and
hot-rolled carbon steel, and specialty stainless and electrical steels produced
in slab, hot band, sheet and strip form. Steel products are primarily for sale
to the domestic automotive, appliance, industrial machinery and equipment, and
construction markets. Steel Operations also include European trading companies
that buy and sell steel and manufactured steel products. At the beginning of
2000, a redundant galvanizing line in Dover, Ohio was shut down Note 10.
The Company Snow and Ice Control Products segment consists of Douglas
Dynamics, L.L.C., the largest North American manufacturer of snowplows, and
salt and sand spreaders for four-wheel drive light trucks.
In addition, the Company owns and operates Sawhill Tubular Products, a
manufacturer of a wide range of steel pipe and tubing products, and an
industrial park on the Houston, Texas ship channel. In 2001, the Company
acquired AK Tube L.L.C., a manufacturer of welded steel tubing. These
businesses are included in Other Operations, below.
On December 18, 2001, the Company announced that it had signed a letter of
intent to sell the assets of Sawhill Tubular to John Maneely Company. The sale,
which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2002, is contingent upon
approval by the boards of directors of both companies.
Accounting policies for the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1. Management evaluates the
performance of these segments based on their operating profit. All corporate
expenses and assets are included in the Steel Operations segment.

10. Special Charges and Unusual Items
In 1999, the Company recognized $997 in special charges for costs related
to the merger with Armco, including $285 of expenses incurred for banking,
legal, accounting and other transaction fees, $511 for employee severance and
certain required payments under the change-of-control provisions contained in
Armco employee benefit plans and $201 for the closure of a redundant
facility. Approximately $540 of the $997 required the outlay of cash in 1999,
with additional cash payments of approximately $70 made in 2000 and $05 made
in 2001. With the exception of certain employee benefits and environmental
expenditures that will be funded over a long period of time, the remainder of
the special charges do not require the outlay of cash.
The charge for closure of the redundant facility relates to the shutdown of
the carbon steel galvanizing plant in Dover, Ohio. The plant ceased production
on December 17, 1999. The announced closure, effective January 29, 2000,
resulted in the termination of 120 employees, the majority of which were
represented hourly production workers. The following provides details of that
portion of the special charge relating to the closure

In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company primary health insurance
provider converted from a mutual insurance company to a corporation, issuing
shares of its common stock to certain of its long-time policyholders. As a
major policyholder, AK Steel received shares of common stock, recording a
benefit of $499. This benefit is net of a liability established to provide
compensation to Company employees and retirees who contributed a small portion
of the premiums for the applicable plans of the insurance provider.
As more fully explained in Note 1 in the paragraph entitled Pension and
Other Postretirement Benefits Accounting, under its method of accounting for
pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the Company recognized, as a
fourth quarter 2001 unusual item, a non-cash pension charge of $1940.
11. Commitments
The principal raw materials required for AK Steel steel manufacturing
operations are carbon and stainless steel scrap, iron ore, coal, electricity,
natural gas, oxygen, chrome, nickel, silicon, molybdenum, zinc, limestone and
other commodity materials. In addition, AK Steel purchases carbon steel slabs
from other steel producers to supplement the production from its own
steelmaking facilities. Purchases of coal, iron ore and limestone, as well as
transportation services, are made at negotiated prices under annual and
multi-year agreements. Most purchases of carbon steel slabs, carbon and
stainless steel scrap, natural gas and other raw materials are made at
prevailing market prices, which are subject to fluctuation in accordance with
supply and demand. AK Steel believes that adequate sources of supply exist for
all of its energy and raw material requirements.
The Company has entered into derivative transactions to hedge the price of
natural gas and certain raw materials. As of December 31, 2001, current and
noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets include $338 and
$60, respectively, for the fair value of these derivatives. The effect on cash
of settling these liabilities is expected to be offset by lower prices paid for
the related commodities.
At December 31, 2001, commitments for future capital investments totaled
approximately $467, all of which will be funded in 2002.

Domestic steel producers, including the Company, are subject to stringent
federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of
human health and the environment.
The Company has expended the following for environmental-related capital
investments and environmental compliance                           1999 2000 2001
Environmental related capital investments $ 71 $101 $188
Environmental compliance costs. 859 935 995  In addition to the items discussed below, the Company is involved in routine
litigation, environmental proceedings, and claims pending with respect to
matters arising out of the normal conduct of the business. Except to the
limited extent noted below with respect to the claims in the Federal Action,
management believes that the ultimate disposition of the following proceedings
will not have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on
the Company consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.
AK Steel and its predecessors have been conducting steel manufacturing and
related operations for more than 100 years. Although their operating practices
are believed to have been consistent with prevailing industry standards during
this time, hazardous materials may have been released in the past at one or
more operating sites, including sites that are no longer owned by AK Steel.
Potential remediation expenditures have been estimated for those sites where
future remediation efforts are probable based on identified conditions,
regulatory requirements or contractual obligations arising from the sale of a
business.
Pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA, which
governs the treatment, handling and disposal of hazardous waste, the United
States Environmental Protection Agency EPA and authorized state
environmental agencies may conduct inspections of RCRA regulated facilities to
identify areas where there have been releases of hazardous waste or hazardous
constituents into the environment and may order the facilities to take
corrective action to remediate such releases. The Company major steelmaking
facilities are subject to RCRA inspections by environmental regulators. While
the Company cannot predict the future actions of these regulators, the
potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities.
Under authority conferred by the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA, the EPA and state environmental
authorities have conducted site investigations at certain of AK Steel
facilities, portions of which previously had been used for disposal of
materials that are currently subject to regulation. While the results of these
investigations are still pending, AK Steel could be directed to expend funds
for remedial activities at the former disposal areas. Because of the uncertain
status of these investigations, however, management cannot predict whether or
when such expenditures might be required or their magnitude.
On July 27, 2001, AK Steel received a Special Notice Letter from the EPA
requesting that AK Steel agree to conduct a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility
Study RI/FS and enter into an administrative order on consent pursuant to
Section 122 of CERCLA regarding the former Hamilton Plant of Armco located in
New Miami, Ohio. The Hamilton Plant is no longer an operating steel mill,
having ceased operations in 1990, and all of its former structures have been
demolished and removed. While AK Steel does not agree that a site-wide RI/FS is
necessary or appropriate at this time, AK Steel has offered to negotiate with
the EPA concerning the specific terms and conditions under which it would
conduct such a study. If an agreement with the EPA cannot be reached on the
specific terms and conditions of the proposed RI/FS, AK Steel intends to
contest this matter vigorously.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
dollars in millions, except per share amounts  Federal regulations promulgated pursuant to the Clean Water Act impose
categorical pretreatment limits on the concentrations of various constituents
in coke plant wastewater prior to discharge into publicly owned treatment works
POTW. Due to concentrations of ammonia and phenol in excess of these limits
in wastewater from the Middletown Works, AK Steel, through the Middletown POTW,
petitioned the EPA for removal credits, a type of compliance exemption, based
on the Middletown POTW satisfactory treatment of the wastewater for ammonia
and phenol. The EPA declined to review the petition on the grounds that it had
not yet promulgated new sludge management rules. AK Steel thereupon sought and
obtained from the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Ohio an injunction prohibiting the EPA from instituting enforcement action
against AK Steel for noncompliance with the pretreatment limitations, pending
the EPA promulgation of the applicable sludge management regulations.
Management is unable to predict the outcome of this matter. However, if the EPA
eventually refuses to grant the petition for removal credits, AK Steel could
incur additional costs to construct pretreatment facilities at the Middletown
Works.
On February 27, 1995, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency OEPA
issued a Notice of Violation with respect to the Zanesville Works alleging
noncompliance with both a 1993 order and various state regulations regarding
hazardous waste management. AK Steel is continuing to work with the OEPA and
the Ohio Attorney General Office to achieve final resolution of this matter.
In addition, AK Steel is negotiating with the EPA for an order concerning these
same waste management issues.
On June 29, 2000, the United States filed a complaint on behalf of the EPA
against AK Steel in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio
the Federal Action for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act, the Clean
Water Act and the RCRA. On the same date, AK Steel filed a Verified Complaint
for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in the Court of Common Pleas for Butler
County, Ohio the State Action against the State of Ohio and the OEPA
seeking a declaration that, among other things, a AK Steel is in compliance
with its operating permits for the blast furnace and basic oxygen furnaces at
its Middletown Works, which would preclude the State of Ohio and the OEPA from
taking any action to order or enforce obligations on AK Steel with respect to
those facilities, and b that any emissions from the Middletown Works do not
cause, or otherwise contribute to, a public nuisance. On June 30, 2000, the
State of Ohio moved to intervene in the Federal Action. On March 29, 2001, the
U.S. District Court ruled that the State of Ohio could conditionally intervene
in the Federal Action. Subsequently, Ohio filed a conditional complaint, which
included various environmental claims, including seven air pollution claims. On
May 9, 2001, AK Steel moved to dismiss all of Ohio claims in the Federal
Action. On July 27, 2001, the Court of Common Pleas in the State Action
declared null and void two Notices of Violation issued by the OEPA upon which
certain of the air pollution claims of the EPA and Ohio in the Federal Action
were predicated. Subsequently, the court held that that effectively concludes
the State Action. AK Steel has appealed that holding to the 12/th District
Court of Appeals in Butler County, Ohio. On October 17, 2001, the OEPA issued a
similar new Notice of Violation, but moved to amend its conditional complaint
in the Federal Action to withdraw four of its air pollution claims, which were
predicated on the two original Notices of Violation that were declared null and
void. On September 27, 2001, the U.S. District Court dismissed with prejudice
the EPA air pollution claim, which had been predicated on the two voided
Notices of Violation letters. In addition, on December 19, 2001, the U.S.
District Court stayed the remaining three air pollution claims of the OEPA in
the Federal Action pending resolution of a related administrative appeal to the
Ohio Environmental Review Appeals Commission addressing the newly issued OEPA
Notice of Violation. AK Steel motion to dismiss the OEPA claims not yet
dismissed in the Federal Action remains pending. No trial date has yet been set
in the Federal Action. AK Steel is vigorously contesting all of the remaining
claims. If OEPA and/or the EPA are completely successful in obtaining the
relief they seek in the Federal Action with respect to their air pollution
claims, it could result in significant penalties and require a substantial
capital investment to install interim pollution control equipment on the blast
furnace and basic oxygen furnaces at the Middletown Works                    45             AK STEEL HOLDING CORPORATION

dollars in millions, except per share amounts
under current federal pollution control regulations before certain proposed new
federal regulations are made final. Once those proposed new federal regulations
become final, AK Steel could be required to make another substantial capital
investment to replace the interim pollution control equipment. Under those
circumstances, the Company may conclude that it is more cost-effective to
purchase slabs than to make them at the Middletown Works and may elect to shut
down the hot end facilities of the Middletown Works. If the EPA and OEPA are
completely successful in obtaining the relief they seek in the Federal Action
with respect to their water and/or RCRA claims, it could result in substantial
penalties and an order requiring AK Steel to investigate and remediate alleged
polychlorinated biphenyl and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contamination in
Monroe Ditch and Dick Creek, which are located on and adjacent to the
Middletown Works. At this time, the Company is unable to estimate the cost of
an adverse outcome related to the air pollution, water pollution or RCRA claims
or the potential cost of a shutdown of the hot end of the Middletown Works.
On September 30, 1998, Armco received an order from the EPA under Section
3013 of RCRA requiring it to develop a plan for investigation of eight areas of
the Mansfield Works that allegedly could be sources of contamination. A site
investigation began in November 2000 and is continuing.
On June 27, 2000, the EPA issued an Emergency Order pursuant to the Safe
Drinking Water Act to AK Steel Butler Works located in Butler, Pennsylvania
concerning discharge of nitrate/nitrite compounds to the Connoquenessing Creek,
an occasional water source for the Borough of Zelienople. On March 2, 2001, AK
Steel entered in an agreed administrative order with the EPA calling for, among
other things, a decrease in the levels of nitrates and nitrites in the treated
water discharged to waters of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania by AK Steel
Butler Works and for the provision of emergency drinking water for Zelienople
during certain times when it must draw drinking water from the Connoquenessing
Creek. AK Steel has taken and is continuing to take the measures necessary to
comply with that order.
On July 13, 2001, Orinoco Iron, C.A. Orinoco filed an action against AK
Steel in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio,
Case No. C-1-01-461. Orinoco and AK Steel are parties to a contract whereby
Orinoco supplies AK Steel with a form of iron ore referred to as hot briquetted
iron HBI. Orinoco asserts claims for breach of contract, repudiation of
contract and breach of a covenant of good faith and fair dealing with respect
to that HBI supply contract and is seeking damages in excess of $600. AK Steel
has filed a response to the Complaint in which it denies Orinoco claims and
asks the court to reform the HBI supply contract to reflect the original intent
of the parties that the price paid by AK Steel under that contract would more
closely track the world price for HBI. Discovery is underway. Trial is
tentatively scheduled for April 2003. AK Steel intends to contest Orinoco
claims vigorously.
In April 2000, a class action was filed in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Ohio by Bernard Fidel and others against AK Steel
Holding Corporation and certain of its directors and officers, alleging
material misstatements and omissions in the Company public disclosure about
its business and operations. The defendants are vigorously defending this
action. AK Steel has filed a motion to dismiss the action, which currently is
pending. Discovery is stayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss. No
trial date has been scheduled.
A number of lawsuits alleging asbestos exposure are pending and continue to
be filed against AK Steel. The majority of these lawsuits have been filed in
Texas and relate to the former Houston Works facility. Such cases typically
involve a large number of plaintiffs claiming against a large number of
defendants. AK Steel is normally named as a defendant by a small percentage of
the plaintiffs who typically were frequenters independent contractors,
delivery personnel, etc. claiming that they were exposed to asbestos while
they were on the premises. AK Steel is actively and vigorously defending these
cases.

dollars in millions, except per share amounts  On January 2, 2002, John D. West, a former employee, filed a purported class
action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio
against the AK Steel Corporation Retirement Accumulation Pension Plan the AK
RAPP and the AK Steel Corporation Benefit Plans Administrative Committee the
AK BPAC claiming that the method used under the AK RAPP to determine lump
sum distributions is improper and that, as a result, the benefits previously
paid to plaintiff and putative class members from the AK RAPP were understated
in violation of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The AK RAPP is the cash balance plan component
of the AK Steel Noncontributory Pension Plan the AK NCPP. The AK NCPP
provides that the Company will indemnify members of AK BPAC from any liability
and expense incurred by reason of serving as a member of AK BPAC. Because the
action was only recently filed, the defendants have not yet responded to the
Complaint and no discovery has yet commenced. The defendants intend to contest
this matter vigorously.
At December 31, 2001, the Company had recorded $123 in current accrued
liabilities and $367 in noncurrent other liabilities on its consolidated
balance sheets for estimated probable costs relating to environmental matters.
13. Discontinued Operations
Certain of Armco former businesses included operations in foreign
countries. At the time of their sale or closure, some of these operations had
unresolved tax issues in those countries. Following consultation with local
country advisors in 1999, Armco determined that it had resolved most of these
issues and reversed a majority of the related reserves, recognizing income of
$75, or $007 per share, in discontinued operations.
