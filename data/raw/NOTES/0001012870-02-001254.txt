Report of Independent Accountants  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of LogicVision, Inc.:  In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of LogicVision, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and the financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  /s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  San Jose, California January 15, 2002

LOGICVISION, INC.  
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1. FORMATION AND BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY  Nature of Business  LogicVision, Inc. the Company was incorporated on July
23, 1992 and on September 15, 2000, the Company was reincorporated in the State of Delaware. The Company provides proprietary technologies for embedded test that enable the more efficient design and manufacture of complex semiconductors. The
embedded test solution allows integrated circuit designers to embed into a semiconductor design test functionality that can be used during semiconductor production and throughout the useful life of the chip. The technology also allows integrated
circuits to be tested after they have been assembled onto boards and systems.  Stock Split 
On September 28, 2000, the Companys Board of Directors approved a one-for-two stock split of the Companys common stock. All share and per share amounts have been
restated to reflect this share split.  Initial Public Offering  In November 2001, the Company completed its initial public offering of 5,085,000 shares of common stock including 585,000 shares purchased by underwriters over-allotment option at
$900 per share. Net proceeds totaled $411 million, net of issuance costs. At the closing of the offering, all of the then issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock were converted into shares of common stock.  2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Basis of Presentation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Reclassifications
Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.  Marketable Securities 
The Company accounts for investments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities. Management determines the
37  
LOGICVISION, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and evaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2001, there were no marketable
securities with contractual maturities in excess of ninety days but less than twelve months. Approximately $120 million of marketable securities had contractual maturities of more than one year. All marketable securities have been classified as
held-to-maturity. Interest and realized gains and losses are included in interest income. Realized gains and losses are recognized based on specific identification method.  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated on
a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term, if shorter. Maintenance and repairs are
charged to operations as incurred.  Long-lived Assets  The Company accounts for impairment of long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed Of SFAS 121, which was issued in March 1995. SFAS 121 requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be
recoverable. The Company evaluates at each balance sheet date whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment. In accordance with SFAS 121, the Company uses an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flow of the
related asset or asset grouping over the remaining life in measuring whether the assets are recoverable. During the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company did not record any impairment to its long-lived assets. 
Stock-Based Compensation  The Company
accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation FIN No. 28,
Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans, and complies with the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under APB Opinion No. 25,
compensation expense is based on the difference, if any, on the date of the grant, between the fair value of the Companys stock and the exercise price. SFASNo123 requires a fair value based method of accounting for an
employee stock option or similar equity instrument. The pro forma disclosures of the difference between compensation expense included in net loss and the related cost measured by the fair value method are presented in Note 8. 
The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues
Task Force EITF No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services. The Company believes that the fair value of the stock
options is more reliably measured than the fair value of the services received. The fair value of each non-employee stock award is remeasured at each period end until a commitment date is reached, which is generally the vesting date. 
Revenue Recognition  The Company
derives license revenues from software and intellectual property licenses, and derives service revenues from maintenance and consulting service contracts. 
38  
LOGICVISION, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The Company derives revenues from licenses generally with terms between one and
three years, which are charged for the right to use the Companys software and intellectual property. Maintenance revenues consist of postcontract customer support PCS. PCS includes telephone support, bug fixes and upgrade
privileges on a when and if available basis. Consulting service revenues typically consist of charges for design service contracts, technology development contracts, installation and training. 
The Company accounts for its revenues under the provisions of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2 as amended by SOP
98-4 and SOP 98-9. The Company recognizes license revenues upon shipment only when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, shipment has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility of the sales proceeds is considered
probable. The Company applies the residual method to those arrangements that include multiple elements, where vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value of the undelivered elements exists. The Company establishes VSOE of
fair value for PCS through the use of maintenance renewal clauses in its contracts, which are substantive, and have historically been purchased by its customers at prices established by management.  When VSOE of the undelivered elements cannot be established and the undelivered element is PCS, the entire revenue is recognized ratably over the term
of the PCS. The maintenance elements of these contracts are recognized ratably over the period of the maintenance contract. The Company, on occasion, offers extended payment terms beyond its normal business practice of between 30 and 60 days to
certain customers. The Company does not have sufficient experience collecting under these extended payment term arrangements. As a result, when payment terms are extended, the fee is not considered fixed or determinable and, therefore, the Company
recognizes revenues when such payments become due. When the Company enters into a multiple element arrangement which includes the future delivery of a specified product or upgrade, all revenue under the agreement is deferred until the specified
product or upgrade has been delivered.  Consulting service revenues are generally fixed-fee contracts recognized on a percentage
of completion basis. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on such contracts, which are primarily short-term in nature, are recorded in the period identified. The balances of unbilled receivables related to these contracts at December 31, 2001
and 2000 were $0 and $233,500, respectively.  Research and Development  Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred.  Software
Development Costs and Capitalized Technology License  Software development costs incurred in the research and development of
new products and enhancements to existing products are charged to expense as incurred. Software development costs are capitalized after technological feasibility has been established. The period between achievement of technological feasibility,
which the Company defines as the establishment of a working model, until the general availability of such software to customers, has been short, and software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant. During the year
ended December 31, 2001, the Company amended its license agreement with Nortel Networks. Pursuant to this amendment, the Company agreed to pay $850,000 in seven quarterly installments of $121,000 beginning March 31, 2001. This amount is included in
other long-term assets and is being amortized over the period of the technology license obligation. At December 31, 2001, $403,000 of this asset remained unamortized. 
39  
LOGICVISION, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Certain Risks and Concentrations  The Companys cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are maintained at six financial institutions, four in the United States, one in Canada and one in the United
Kingdom. Deposits in these institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits.  For accounts receivable,
management of the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers. Based on the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable balance, the Company
maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts. At December 31, 2001, four customers accounted for approximately 46% of net accounts receivable and 15 customers accounted for approximately 50% of total revenues none exceeded 10%. At December 31,
2000, two customers accounted for approximately 38% of net accounts receivable and six customers accounted for approximately 28% of total revenues.  The Company operates in one industry segment. The following is a summary of the Companys revenues by geographic operations. Revenues are attributed to the countries in which the products and services are
delivered.

For all periods presented, substantially all of the Companys long-lived
assets were located in the United States.  There can be no assurance that the market will accept the Companys technology
as an alternative to current design test development methods. If the market does not accept the Companys technology at all or in the time frame anticipated in the Companys projections, the Companys revenues and results of
operations would be materially affected.  The Companys products include components subject to rapid technological change.
Significant technological change could adversely affect the Companys future operating results. While the Company has ongoing programs to minimize the adverse effect of such changes and considers technological change in estimating its
allowances, such estimates could change in the future.  Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement
and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts
expected to be realized.  Foreign Currency Translation  The Company has foreign subsidiaries whose financial statements are denominated in the local currency. Foreign exchange gains and losses, which result from the process of remeasuring foreign currency financial
40  
LOGICVISION, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
statements into U.S. dollar, have been included on the balance sheet as a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment included in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments  Carrying amounts of certain of the Companys financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their
short maturities.  Net Loss Per Share  Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of the common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per
share does not differ from basic net loss per share since potential common shares from conversion of preferred stock, stock options and warrants and outstanding shares of common stock subject to repurchase are anti-dilutive for all periods
presented.  Comprehensive Income Loss  The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. This statement requires companies to classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in
the financial statements and display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid-in-capital in the equity section of the balance sheet. For all periods presented, the primary
differences between the Companys net income loss and comprehensive income loss arise from foreign currency translation adjustments.  Recent
Accounting Pronouncements  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The new standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging contracts. In July 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging ActivitiesDeferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133. SFAS No. 137 deferred the effective date of SFAS
No. 133 until fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have an impact on our financial statements.  In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141 addresses accounting and financial reporting for business combinations. Also in June 2001, the FASB issued
SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 142 changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment-only approach. The Company has adopted SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No142.
Adoption of SFAS No. 141 and 142 did not impact the Companys financial statements.  In October 2001, the FASB issued
Statement of Accounting Standards No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets FAS 144. FAS 144 supersedes FAS 121 Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets
to Be Disposed Of. FAS 144 applies to all long-lived assets including discontinued operations and consequently amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 APB 30, Reporting Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal
of a Segment of a Business. FAS 144 develops one accounting model for long-lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale. FAS 144
41  
LOGICVISION, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
requires that long-lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell. Additionally, FAS 144 expands the scope of discontinued
operations to include all components of an entity with operations that 1 can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and 2 will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction. FAS 144 is effective for the
Company for all financial statements issued in fiscal 2003. The Company expects that the initial application of SFAS 144 will not have a material impact on its financial statements.  3.PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  Property and equipment comprise in

8.STOCK OPTION PLANS AND WARRANTS  On August 3, 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the establishment of the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan the 2000 Plan with 1,000,000
shares reserved for grant under the Plan. The Plan was approved by the Companys stockholders in November 2000 and was effective upon the Companys October 2001 initial public offering. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the
2000 Plan will be increased on the first day of each of the Companys fiscal years from 2002 to 2010 by the lesser of 750,000 shares, 35% of the outstanding shares of the Companys common stock on that date or a lesser amount determined
by the Board of Directors. The 2000 Plan is intended to serve as a successor to the 1994 Flexible Stock Option Plan the 1994 Plan and all remaining shares available for grant under the 1994 Plan were authorized for issuance under the
2000 Plan. As of December 31, 2001, no options were available for further grant under the 1994 Plan.  Under the 2000 Plan, the
Board of Directors has the authority to determine the type of option and the number of shares subject to each option. The exercise price is generally equal to fair value of the underlining
43  
LOGICVISION, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
stock at the date of grant. Options generally become exercisable over a four-year period and, if not exercised, expire ten years from the date of grant.  Under the 2000 Plan, the Board of Directors has the discretion to grant options to nonemployee directors. Each nonemployee director who first becomes a
Board member after the date of the initial public offering may be granted an option to purchase 7,500 shares. In addition, each nonemployee director may be granted on an annual basis an option to purchase of 2,500 shares.

The Company has established a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax
assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets. Management evaluates, on an annual basis, the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and the level of the valuation allowance.  As of December 31, 2001, the Company had federal and California net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $35,068,000 and $10,481,000 available
to reduce future federal and California taxable income, respectively. These federal and California carryforwards begin to expire in 2007 and 2002, respectively, if not utilized. The extent to which these carryforwards can be used to offset future
taxable income may be limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state tax law.  At December 31,
2001, the Company had federal and California research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1,067,000 and $484,000 respectively. These federal tax credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2007, if not utilized; the California
tax credit carryforwards do not expire. The extent to which these tax credit carryforwards can be used to offset future taxes may be limited under Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state law.  For financial reporting purposes the tax effect of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards have been recorded as deferred tax assets.
