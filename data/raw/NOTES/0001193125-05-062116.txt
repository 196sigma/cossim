8 PART II Item5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer collectively, the Certifying Officers are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for us that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in this report is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officers as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Our management, including each of the Certifying Officers, does not expect
that our disclosure controls or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and
that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control. The design of any system of
controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, control may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of these inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur
and not be detected.  In connection with the preparation of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Certifying Officers, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys
disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures include certain components of its internal control over financial reporting. 
34 Table of Contents
Insofar as managements assessment of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures involves an assessment of its internal control over
financial reporting, such assessment is expressed at the level of reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes. In performing its evaluation, management
reviewed in particular the Companys practices relating to the treatment of the non-cash interest expense relating to its August 2003 convertible note financing and the related restatement reflected in this Annual Report and described in Note 2
of Notes to Financial Statements. The evaluation considered the procedures used by the Company in facing non-routine or complex transactions, including its reliance on consultation with its outside financial experts in connection with the accounting
treatment for such complex transactions where appropriate, and considered whether such procedures are effective, among other things, in providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In light of the restatement described above, the Companys Certifying Officers concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective as of December 31, 2004.  The Company, under
the supervision of its Certifying Officers, is currently evaluating potential steps that it can take to remediate any deficiencies in its disclosure controls and procedures, including steps that can be taken in the process of documenting and
evaluating the applicable accounting treatment for non-routine or complex transactions as they may arise. The Company has also been using an outside consultant to assist the Company with its review of internal control over financial reporting. As
noted above, particularly in light of the Companys limited resources, the Companys control system is unlikely to provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, even if certain remedial steps can be
identified and taken.  The Certifying Officers also have
indicated that there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 that materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
