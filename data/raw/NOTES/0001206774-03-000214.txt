These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Avigen, Inc. at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2002, for the six months ended December 31, 2001, for each of the two fiscal years in the period ended June 30, 2001 and for the period from inception October 22, 1992 through December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
Avigen, Inc. was incorporated on October 22, 1992 in Delaware for the purpose of development and commercialization of gene-based therapeutic products. Our activities since inception have consisted principally of acquiring product rights, raising capital, establishing facilities and performing research and development. Accordingly, we are considered to be in the development stage. In accordance with statement of Financial Accounting Standards FAS No. 131, we have determined that we operate in a single segment.
We expect to continue to incur substantial losses over the next several years while we continue in this development stage. We plan to meet our capital requirements primarily through issuances of equity securities, research and development contract revenue, collaborative agreement revenue, and in the longer term, revenue from product sales. We intend to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing, when market conditions allow. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms in the future, if at all. 
In August 2001, we changed our fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31, effective December 31, 2001.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. These amounts are recorded at cost, which approximates fair market value.
Available for Sale Securities
We invest our excess cash balances in marketable securities, primarily corporate debt securities, government agencies, asset-backed securities and municipal bonds, with the primary investment objectives of preservation of principal, a high degree of liquidity, and maximum total return. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, we have classified our investments in marketable securities as available for sale. Available for sale securities are reported at market value and unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, if any, are excluded from earnings and are reported in other comprehensive income and as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized. A decline in the market value of a security below its cost that is deemed other than temporary is charged to
earnings, and would result in the establishment of a new cost basis for the security. 
Our available-for-sale securities consist principally of obligations with a minimum short-term rating of A1/P1 and a minimum long-term rating of A- and with effective maturities of less than three years. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is included in interest income.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
Restricted Investments
In June 2000, we initially entered into a financing arrangement to support construction related activities. Under this arrangement, we have pledged $100 million of our portfolio of available for sale securities to secure this long-term obligation. 
In January 2002, we also entered into equipment operating leases for certain research and development equipment. Under the terms of these leases, we have pledged $15 million of our portfolio of available for sale securities to secure these equipment operating leases. 
At December 31, 2002 and 2001, $115 million and $100 million, respectively, were classified as restricted investments, representing the combined aggregate portion of our portfolio for available for sale securities that were pledged in connection with our financing arrangement and equipment operating leases.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Cash, cash equivalents, available for sale securities and restricted investments consist of financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk to the extent of the value of the assets recorded on the balance sheet. We believe that we have established guidelines for investment of our excess cash that maintain safety and liquidity through our policies on diversification among asset classes and issuers, as well as across investment maturities.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which range from three to seven years, using the straight-line method.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the remaining life of the lease or their estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter, using the straight-line method. 
Revenue Recognition
Grant revenue is recorded in the period in which the revenue is earned as defined by the grant agreement. Since our inception, our revenue has consisted primarily of grant revenue, which includes amounts earned pursuant to reimbursements under government grants. Between inception and December 31, 2002, all reimbursements under government grants have come from the National Institutes of Health. 
Royalty revenue from license agreements is recorded as earned in accordance with the contract terms when third-party results can be reliably determined and collectibility is reasonably assured. During 2002, we recorded $19,000 in royalty revenue in connection with sales from a third party of products that utilize our AAV technologies. These products are sold for research purposes only and were primarily sold within the U.S. 
Non-refundable product license fees, including fees associated with research license agreements, for which we have no further performance obligations, and no continuing involvement requirements, are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured. 
Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. Comprehensive loss is shown in the statement of stockholders equity.

Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses include related salaries and benefits, laboratory materials, clinical trial and related clinical trial manufacturing costs, contract and outside service fees, and facilities and overhead costs. Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for independent, as well as collaborative, research and development. These costs are charged to expense as incurred.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes FAS 109. Under the asset and liability method of FAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period of enactment. To date, we have no history of earnings. As such, we cannot anticipate taxable income as outlined in FAS 109. Therefore, the deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Securities that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, but that have been excluded from the diluted net loss per share computation because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive, were as follows

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted FAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. FAS 144 supersedes FAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of. We review long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. To date, we have not experienced any such losses. 
Reclassifications
We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to our current years presentation. The reclassifications had no impact on our financial position or results of operations.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, and interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of FAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to the guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective 
51
AVIGEN, INC.a development stage company
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
for financial statement of periods that end after December 15, 2002. However, the provision for the initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. This interpretation does not currently have any impact on our financial position, results of operations or disclosure.
In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. FAS 148 amends FAS 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, FAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of FAS 123 to require more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The additional disclosure requirements of FAS 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. We have elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by APB 25 to account
for employee and director stock options. See below in the Stock Options and Stock Purchase Plan note for the disclosures required by FAS 148.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applied in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. FIN 46 applies to public
enterprises as of the beginning of the applicable interim or annual period. We do not believe there will be a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations from the adoption of the provision of FIN 46. 52
AVIGEN, INC.as development stage company
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
Stock-Based Compensation
We have elected to continue to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 or APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations, to account for stock options granted to our employees and directors. Under APB 25, using the prescribed intrinsic value method of accounting, no compensation expense is recognized because the exercise price of the stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the option grant.
The information regarding net loss and loss per share as required by FAS 123 has been determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options under the fair value method prescribed by FAS 123. The resulting effect on net loss and loss per share pursuant to FAS 123 is not likely to be representative of the effects on net loss and loss per share pursuant to FAS 123 in future years, since future years are likely to include additional grants and the irregular impact of future years vesting. 
No stock-based employee compensation is reflected in our net loss as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of our underlying common stock on the date of grant. The following table illustrates the effect on our net loss and loss per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123 to our stock-based employee compensation

During the preparation of our notes to the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2002, we determined that the calculation of the total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under the fair value based method for the
six months ended December 31, 2001 and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, as reported in those respective years, inadvertently omitted certain options which vested during those periods. Accordingly, the amounts of the total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under the fair value method reported under SFAS
123 for the six months ended December 31, 2001 and the year ended June 30, 2001 presented in the table above have been revised, resulting in increases in the previously reported amounts of $49 million and $39 million, respectively. This revision had no effect on our previously reported results of operations or financial condition. 
For equity awards to non-employees, including lenders, lessors and consultants, we apply the Black-Scholes method to determine the fair value of such investments. The options and warrants granted to non-employees are re-measured as they vest and the resulting value is recognized as an expense over the period of services received or the term of the related financing.

Total depreciation and amortization expense for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, the six-month transition period ended December 31, 2001, and the fiscal years ended June 30, 2001 and 2000, was $31 million, $12 million, $12 million, and $04 million, respectively.
In the normal course of business, we have entered into contracts for the construction and improvement of our research and manufacturing facilities. While these contracts are typically cancelable, we expect the work described in such contracts to be completed and all amounts paid when due. At December 31, 2002, there were no longer any construction projects in progress, and all completed leasehold improvements were placed in service before such date.
4.Loan Payable
In June 2000, we entered into a financing arrangement for construction related activities. Under this arrangement, we had the right to borrow up to $10 million through June 1, 2003. This revolving line of credit was amended in June 2002 to extend the expiration date to June 1, 2005, thereby deferring the timetable to repay the principal borrowed for two additional years. Amounts borrowed under this arrangement bear interest at the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate plus 15% on the date of each drawdown and this interest rate is subsequently reset every three months. The weighted average interest rate for all outstanding drawdowns on this long-term obligation was 311% at December 31, 2002. We have pledged a portion of our portfolio of available for sale securities equal to the amount of outstanding borrowings to secure this long-term obligation, and have identified these pledged assets as restricted
investments on our balance sheets. As of both December 31, 2002 and 2001, we had borrowed $8 million from the line of credit. Payments of interest only are due monthly through June 1, 2005, at which time a balloon payment of outstanding principal is due. In November 2000, we reserved $2 million in borrowing capacity from the line of credit to secure a letter of credit. The letter of credit was established pursuant to the terms required under a ten-year property lease entered into in November 2000, and was issued in favor of the property owner. As a result of the cash borrowings and the establishment of the letter of credit, we did not have any remaining borrowing capacity under the line of credit at December 31, 2002.
5.Stockholders Equity
Common Stock
In August and September 1998, we issued an aggregate of 1,306,505 shares of our common stock at $225 to $294 per share to selected institutional investors. The offering was completed through a private placement. As part of the transaction, we issued warrants to purchase 261,301 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $218 to $367 per share. The exercise price was 125% of the fair market value per share of our underlying stock on the corresponding closing day and the warrants carry a five-year term. After deducting commissions and fees from the gross proceeds of $2,969,000, net proceeds from this transaction approximated $2,735,000. 
In December 1998, we issued 1,367,280 shares of our common stock at $381 to $488 per share to selected institutional investors. The offering was completed through a private placement. As part of this transaction, we issued warrants to purchase 273,456 shares of our common stock with an exercise price ranging from $476 to $609 per share. The exercise price was 125% of the fair market value per share of our underlying stock on the corresponding closing day and the warrants carry a five-year term. After deducting commissions and fees from the gross proceeds of $5,635,000, net proceeds from this transaction approximated $5,197,000.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In February and April 1999, we issued an aggregate of 2,198,210 shares of our common stock at $550 to $600 per share to selected institutional investors. The offering was completed through a private placement. As part of this transaction, we issued warrants to purchase 439,642 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $687 to $750 per share. The exercise price was 125% of the fair market value per share of the underlying stock on the corresponding closing day and the warrants carry a five-year term. After deducting commissions and fees from the gross proceeds of $13,189,000, net proceeds from this transaction approximated $12,156,000.
In October and November 1999, we issued an aggregate of 2,033,895 shares of our common stock at $1619 to $2556 per share to selected institutional investors. The offering was completed through a private placement. As part of this transaction, we issued warrants to purchase 406,779 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $2025 to $3195 per share. The exercise price was 125% of the fair market value per share of our underlying stock on the corresponding closing day and the warrants carry a five-year term. After deducting commissions and fees from the gross proceeds of $40,028,000, net proceeds from this transaction approximated $37,222,000.
In March 2000, we issued a warrant to purchase 40,000 shares of our common stock as partial consideration for the extension of our building lease. The fair value of this warrant at the date of issuance was approximately $1,738,000. This fair value is being amortized over the life of the lease extension. This warrant was issued with an exercise price equal to the fair market value per share of our underlying stock at the time of issuance, $5600, and carries a five-year term. 
Also, in March 2000, we issued a warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of our common stock as partial consideration for the acquisition of certain patent licenses used in our research and development activities. The fair value of this warrant was approximately $3,182,000 and was fully expensed during the year ended June 30, 2000. This warrant was issued with an exercise price equal to the fair market value per share of our underlying stock at the time of issuance, $8200, and carries a five-year term.
In April and May 2000, we issued an aggregate of 1,150,000 shares of our common stock at $2600 per share through a public offering. After deducting commissions and fees from the gross proceeds of $29,900,000, net proceeds from this transaction totaled $27,611,000.
In November 2000, we issued an aggregate of 2,291,239 shares of our common stock between $3750 and $4506 per share through a public offering. After deducting combined commissions and fees from the gross proceeds of $90,706,000, net proceeds from this transaction totaled $86,086,000.
In February 2001, we issued 313,636 shares of common stock at $4782 per share to Bayer AG, in connection with a collaboration agreement entered into with Bayer Corporation dated November 17, 2000. Net proceeds from this transaction totaled $15,000,000.

Under the 1993Plan, options could be granted at a price per share not less than the fair market value at the date of grant. In March 1996, the Board determined to grant no further options under the 1993 Plan and adopted the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan. At December 31, 2002, there were options to purchase approximately 36,000 shares outstanding under the 1993 Plan, with no further shares available for grant.
The 1996 Equity Incentive Plan 1996 Plan provides for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock purchase awards, stock bonuses and stock appreciation rights to our employees, directors and consultants. The Plan originally authorized the grant of options to purchase up to 600,000 shares of common stock. As a result of a series of amendments which were approved by stockholders, as of December 31, 2002, there were 3,500,000 shares authorized for grant under the 1996 Plan. Under the 1996 Plan, incentive stock options may be granted at a price per share not less than the fair market value at the date of grant, and  57

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
nonqualified stock options may be granted at a price per share not less than 85% of the fair market value at the date of grant. Options granted generally have a maximum term of 10 years from the grant date and become exercisable over four years. At December 31, 2002, there were options to purchase approximately 1,546,000 shares outstanding under the 1996 Plan and approximately 1,339,000 shares available for grant. 
In June 2000, the Board of Directors adopted the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan 2000 Plan which provides for grants of nonqualified stock options, restricted stock purchase awards, and stock bonuses to our employees, directors and consultants to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock; provided, however, that generally only up to 40% of the shares subject to grants under the 2000 Plan may be made to our directors and officers. Under the 2000 Plan, options may be granted at a price per share not less than 85% of the fair market value at the date of grant. Options granted generally have a maximum term of 10 years from the grant date and become exercisable over four years. At December 31, 2002, there were options to purchase approximately 1,860,000 shares outstanding under the 2000 Plan and approximately 3,140,000 shares available for grant.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In September 1997, we adopted the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Purchase Plan. A total of 360,000 shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance under the Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2002, there have been no employee contributions to the Purchase Plan.
Non-employee Stock Options 
In July 1995, we granted the Chairman of our Board of Directors an option to purchase 515,248 shares of our common stock at $049 per share, exercisable for 10 years from the date of grant. The shares vested in equal monthly installments over a period of three years beginning with the grant date. At December 31, 2002, the option was fully vested; however, no part of this option had been exercised. Such grant was made outside of any of our stock option plans.
The 1996 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan the Directors Plan provides for automatic grants of options to purchase shares of our common stock to our non-employee directors. The Plan originally authorized the grant of options to purchase up to 200,000 shares of common stock. The Directors Plan was later amended and approved by stockholders to increase the number of shares available for grant to 300,000. As of December 31, 2002, nonqualified options to purchase approximately 207,000 shares of common stock between $200 and $4075 per share, exercisable for 10 years from the date of grant, have been granted under the Directors Plan, of which options to purchase 187,000 shares remained outstanding. At December 31, 2002, there were approximately 93,000 shares available for grant under the Directors Plan. 58

The numbers of options exercisable at December 31, 2001, June 30, 2001 and 2000 were 1,569,789, 1,217,656, and 875,787 respectively, with a weighted average exercise price of $1213, $925, and $231 respectively.
For purposes of disclosure pursuant to FAS 123 as amended by FAS 148, the estimated fair value of our employee stock options is amortized to expense over the vesting period of the options. We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of our options on the date of grant with the following assumptions: 
Year ended December 31, 2002 
Six months ended December 31 2001 
Year ended June 30,

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options and warrants that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in our opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options.  60

7.Employee Profit Sharing/401k Plan
In January 1996, we adopted a Tax Deferred Savings Plan under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code the Plan for all full-time employees. Under the Plan, our eligible employees can contribute amounts to the Plan via payroll withholding, subject to certain limitations. Our matching contributions to the Plan are discretionary and can only be made in cash. Effective July 1, 2001, we began matching 25% of an employees contributions up to $2,500 per Plan year. These matching contributions vest ratably over a five-year period based on the employees initial hire date. Our matching contributions for all employees for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the six months ended December 31, 2001 were approximately $134,000 and $65,000, respectively.
8.Collaboration Agreement
In November 2000, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Bayer Corporation Bayer. Under the terms of the agreement, Bayer, in collaboration with us, will conduct Phase II/III clinical trials for our product, Coagulin-B, and receive exclusive worldwide marketing and distribution rights to the product. We will file and bear the cost of regulatory approvals and will be the holder of regulatory licenses worldwide. We will manufacture the product and will receive a share of the gross revenues from future Coagulin-B sales, as well as a royalty on net sales of the product for our intellectual property. Bayer will also make milestone payments, pay for third-party costs of the clinical trials, and reimburse us costs of manufacturing AAV vector used in the clinical trials. 
In connection with this collaboration agreement, in February 2001, we issued to Bayer AG, an affiliate of Bayer, 313,636 shares of common stock at $4782 per share, resulting in proceeds of $15 million.
9.Commitments
We lease our laboratory, manufacturing, and office facilities under multiple non-cancelable operating lease agreements, which expire at various times through November 2010. Under one operating lease, we have pledged $20 million of our available for sale securities to secure a letter of credit required under the terms of the lease and under a separate operating lease, we have pledged $15 million of our investment portfolio as collateral for the lease. These amounts are included in restricted investments on the balance sheet at December 31, 2002 and December31, 2001. We have the option to purchase the equipment under these operating leases at the greater of their fair value at the end of the lease or 20% of the original cost.

We also enter into commitments to fund collaborative research and clinical work performed by third parties. While these contracts are cancelable, we expects the research studies and clinical work to be completed as defined in the terms of the agreements, and all amounts paid when due. At December 31, 2002 the estimated costs related to these commitments totaled $876,000, all of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve to eighteen months. 61

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Due to our history of losses, a valuation allowance has been provided against the full amount of deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing any benefits from these assets. The valuation allowance increased by $12,200,000, $4,620,000, and $8,860,000 for the year ended December31, 2002, six months ended December 31, 2001 and the year ended June 30, 2001, respectively.
Deferred tax assets related to carryforwards at December 31, 2002 include approximately $1,300,000 associated with stock option activity for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will be credited directly to stockholders equity.
At December 31, 2002, we have net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $105,000,000 and $16,000,000, respectively, which expire in years ended December 31, 2005 through December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2002, we have research and development credit carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately $3,500,000, which expire in fiscal years ended December 31, 2009 through December 31, 2022.
Because of the change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, utilization of our tax net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation in future periods. As a result of the annual limitation, a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce future income tax liabilities. 62 AVIGEN, INC.a development stage company

Collaboration Milestone Payment
In March 2003, we received a $25 million milestone payment from Bayer Corporation under the terms of our collaboration agreement in recognition of the clinical progress to date in our Coagulin-B liver trial. This milestone payment is expected to be recorded as revenue in 2003.
Legal proceedings
On February 12, 2003, we settled a lawsuit that we had initiated on February 21, 2002 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that Research Corporation Technologies, Inc. RCT, engaged in a breach of contract as a result of RCTs failure to disclose material information to the Patent and Trademark Office in connection with the prosecution of a U.S. patent application which subsequently issued as a U.S. patent. In May 1992, we entered into a license agreement with RCT for rights to the invention
that was described by this patent application and other related patent applications. On June 20, 2002, RCT filed an answer to the complaint and a counterclaim alleging our failure to pay royalties under the license agreement and seeking $100,000 in damages. The parties agreed to a dismissal of both our complaint and RCTs
counterclaim with prejudice except that the dismissal does not affect our rights to assert unenforceability and/or invalidity of any RCT patent, including U.S. Patent No. 6,261,834 and any co-pending applications, continuations,
