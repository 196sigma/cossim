REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Stockholders of
Health Systems Design Corporation:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Health
Systems Design Corporation a Delaware corporation and subsidiary as of
September 30, 1997 and 1996, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, changes in stockholders' equity deficit and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended September 30, 1997. These consolidated
financial statements and the schedules referred to below are the responsibility
of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements and schedules based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Health Systems Design
Corporation and subsidiary as of September 30, 1997 and 1996, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended September 30, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedules listed in Item 14 of Form
10-K are presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and are not part of the basic financial statements. These
schedules have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state in all material
respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole.

HEALTH SYSTEMS DESIGN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION:
Health Systems Design Corp. was incorporated in the State of California on
July 1, 1988. In February 1996, the Company was reorganized as Health Systems
Design Corporation the Company, a Delaware holding corporation which owns
100% of the stock of Health System Design Corp., the California corporation. The
Company is a provider of managed care information systems software to payors and
providers of managed care services. The Company introduced its first internally
developed product, DIAMOND 725, in fiscal 1992 followed by DIAMOND 950C/S in
fiscal 1995 and DIAMOND 725Q in fiscal 1996.
Substantially all of the Company operations are in one industry
segment--developing and selling managed care information systems. Therefore, no
separate industry segment information is presented.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
PRINCIPALS OF CONSOLIDATION
The Consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Health Systems
Design Corporation and its subsidiary. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
CASH
The Company considers cash to be all highly liquid investments with an
original maturity less than three months from the date of purchase.
CONCENTRATION OF BUSINESS RISKS
The market for the Company products and services is characterized by
intense competition, rapid technological developments, frequent new product
introductions, and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, the Company is
required to continually improve the performance, features and reliability of its
products and develop and maintain strategic relationships with distributors and
with other service organizations. In addition, substantially all of the
Company revenue is derived from its three principal products.
The Company operates in the United States, but has contracts in progress in
South Africa, New Zealand, Mexico and Greece. These contracts could be impacted
by the economic and political stability of these nations.
See Note 8 for discussion of sales to major customers.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. The Company believes
it has addressed this risk through its contract approval process.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: CONTINUED
ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
For the year ending September 30, 1998, the Company will report its Earnings
per Share EPS based upon the recently issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 128 SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. The pro forma effect of
this accounting change on the year ended September 30, 1997 is:
Primary EPS as    $  060
Pro forma effect of SFAS No. 128.   $  000
Basic EPS pro    $  060
Fully diluted EPS as    $  060
Pro forma effect of SFAS No. 128.   $  000
Diluted EPS pro    $  060
For the year ending September 30, 1999, the Company will report
Comprehensive Income based upon the recently issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130 SFAS No. 130, Comprehensive Income. The pro
forma effect of this accounting change on the year ended September 30, 1997 is:
Net loss as   $ 3,856,304
Pro forma effect of SFAS No. 130.  $     0
Comprehensive income pro   $ 3,856,304
The Company adopted SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for the Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, beginning
October 1, 1996. The Company also adopted SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, beginning October 1, 1996. The adoption of these
pronouncements did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial
statements of the Company taken as a whole.
MANAGEMENT'S USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant estimates made by management include revenue recognition under the
percentage-of-completion method for its license contracts which require extended
installation periods, determination of technological feasibility of software
under development and related research and development cost capitalization,
product life amortization periods for capitalized software costs, and allowance
for doubtful accounts receivable, and certain other reserves, including a
reserve for commitments under a marketing agreement see Note 12.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company licenses its internally developed software products and other
software products to health care organizations under the terms of product
license contracts. Individual sales may include, among others, a combination of
software license, implementation, program modifications, training, and support.
Contracts with customers may be terminated under certain circumstances and
revenues recognized could be refundable upon termination in certain cases,
including breach of contract. The termination
27
HEALTH SYSTEMS DESIGN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: CONTINUED
of customer contracts could have a material adverse effect on the Company
business, financial condition, or results of operations.
In December 1991, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
AICPA issued Statement of Position SOP 91-1, Software Revenue Recognition.
The Company revenue recognition policy is in compliance with the provisions of
this SOP. In October, 1997, the AICPA issued SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, which the Company is required to adopt as of October 1, 1998. The
Company believes that the adoption of this pronouncement will not have a
material impact on its revenue recognition policy nor on the financial
statements taken as a whole.
The Company generates revenues from licensing the rights to use its software
products directly to end users and indirectly through distributors. The Company
also generates revenues from sales of post-contract support, implementation and
modification services, and training services performed for customers who license
the Company products.
If collection is probable, the Company generally recognizes license revenue
on a percentage of completion basis based on the labor hours required to
implement the system. If there are no significant post-delivery obligations and
if collection is probable, the Company recognizes license revenue upon shipment
of the software to end users. If a software license agreement provides for
acceptance criteria that extend beyond the published specifications of the
applicable product, then revenues are recognized upon the earlier of customer
acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period. If discounts are granted
on purchase of future products, the discount is allocated pro rata over the
current and potential future product sale. In situations where there are
undelivered elements that are critical to functionality of the software product,
the entire license fee is deferred.
Implementation, modification and training fees are billed either on an
hourly or a monthly basis and are recognized as services are rendered. Third
party software and hardware are typically billed and recognized as revenue when
delivered to the end user.
Post-contract support services are billed on a monthly basis. Customers who
purchase post-contract support services under maintenance agreements have the
right to receive unspecified product updates, upgrades and enhancements.
Customers that do not purchase post-contract support must purchase product
updates, upgrades and enhancements under separate agreements that are subject to
the criteria of the Company revenue recognition policy. Revenues from
post-contract support services are recognized ratably over the term of the
support period. If post-contract support services are included free or at a
discount in a license agreement, such amounts are allocated out of the license
fee at their fair market value based on the value established by independent
sale of such post-contract support services to customers.
In January 1994, the Company entered into a marketing agreement with another
company, whereby the other company markets certain of the Company products to
its customer base see Notes 8 and 12. License fees under this agreement are
recognized when a contract between the other company and the end-user is
executed for DIAMOND 725 and are recognized for DIAMOND 950C/S upon successful
implementation of the system at the other company end-user site. Revenues
under term license agreements are recognized ratably over the client contract
term. Fees for support and other services are recognized as services are
rendered.
Revenue recognized in excess of billing is recorded as an asset unbilled
revenue. Billings in excess of recognized revenue is recorded as a liability
unearned revenue.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: CONTINUED
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
The Company capitalizes software development costs in accordance with SFAS
No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or
otherwise financed. Costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological
feasibility are charged to expense as incurred. When technological feasibility
of a software product or significant enhancement to a software product has been
established, software development costs are capitalized. Capitalization begins
upon the establishment of a working model. Capitalization ceases when the
product is considered available for general release to customers. Capitalized
software development costs are amortized to direct costs over the estimated
economic lives of the software products based on actual sales experience and
product life expectancy. Generally, estimated economic lives of the software
products do not exceed 3 years. Capitalized software development cost
amortization was $192,244, $235,001 and $93,573 in fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Computer equipment and office furniture are recorded at cost and are
depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of
three and seven years, respectively. The cost of assets retired or otherwise
disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts, and any gain or loss is included in the results of operations.
Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the life of assets are
expensed as incurred.
INCOME TAXES
The Company provides for income taxes under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, issued in
February 1992. Under the liability method specified by SFAS No. 109, deferred
income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the effective
tax rates. A valuation allowance is placed on the deferred tax assets to reduce
them to their net realizable value. The Company was on the cash basis of
accounting for tax reporting purposes during the fiscal years ended September
30, 1996 and 1995 and changed to the accrual basis of accounting as of October
1, 1996.
NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE
Net income loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of
shares outstanding. Common equivalent shares from stock options and warrants are
excluded from the computation as their effect is antidilutive in fiscal 1997 and
1996, except that, pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC
Staff Accounting Bulletins, stock options and warrants issued during the
12-month period prior to the proposed initial public offering at prices below
the assumed public offering price have been included in the calculation as if
they were outstanding for all periods prior to and through the initial public
offering date using the treasury stock method.
3. LINE OF CREDIT:
In May 1995, the Company entered into a line of credit agreement with a
bank. Under the terms of the agreement, as amended, the outstanding balance
could not exceed $750,000, and interest was calculated at the bank reference
rate plus 15 percent 1025 percent at September 30, 1995. Borrowings were
limited to 70 percent of eligible accounts receivable, as defined. The
outstanding balance under the
29
HEALTH SYSTEMS DESIGN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
3. LINE OF CREDIT: CONTINUED
line of credit was $508,427 at September 30, 1995. The line of credit agreement
also contained restrictions on the Company ability to pay dividends.
Repayments under the line of credit were guaranteed by three stockholders of the
Company, and were secured by substantially all the assets of the Company. The
agreement expired May 30, 1996, by which time all outstanding balances had been
repaid.
4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:
During fiscal 1996 and 1995, a stockholder of the Company made advances to
the Company totaling $175,000 and $325,000, respectively. All advances were due
upon demand, but no later than one year from the date of the advance and bore
interest at rates ranging from 59 to 61 percent. The impact of imputing
interest at the market rate was not material. The advance was repaid with the
proceeds of the March 5, 1996 initial public offering See Note 10.

The provision for income taxes differed from the amount computed using the
statutory federal income tax rate of 34 percent as follows:

For financial reporting purposes, a 100% valuation allowance has been
recorded at September 30, 1997 to offset the deferred tax assets recognized
under SFAS No. 109 because the Company has historically not achieved significant
levels of profitability, and there is inherent uncertainty as to when the
Company will achieve future profitability.
At September 30, 1997, the Company has approximately $7,773,000 and $494,000
of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax
credits, respectively, which are available to reduce future taxable income of
the Company, if any. These carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal 2007.
Provisions under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 may limit the federal net
operating loss carryforwards and credits available to be used in any given year
in the event of a significant change in ownership, including the March 5, 1996
initial public offering.
The Company has approximately $3,717,000 and $277,000 of California tax net
operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits,
respectively, which are available to reduce future taxable income of the
Company, if any. The carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal 2010.
8. SALES TO MAJOR CUSTOMERS:
HEALTH PLANS
In March, 1996, the Company executed an agreement with a health plan the
Plan which granted a perpetual license to use Diamond 950 C/S, and provided for
implementation services and modifications to the product. The Company, in turn,
agreed to pay royalties to the Plan for modifications developed as part of the
agreement. Royalties will be based on a percentage of the Diamond 950C/S license
fees paid to the Company which meet certain criteria. The Company recognized
revenues under the Agreement of approximately $3,799,000 in fiscal year 1997.
This was approximately 23% of total revenues in fiscal 1997. The Company also
recorded royalty expense of $169,452 in fiscal year 1997.
In January 1997, the Company executed another agreement the 1997 Agreement
with a health plan which granted a perpetual license to use Diamond
Client/Server, along with providing implementation services and modifications to
the product. The Company recognized revenues under the 1997 Agreement of
approximately $1,922,000 in fiscal year 1997. This was approximately 11% of the
total revenues of the Company in fiscal year 1997.

SMS
In January 1994, the Company entered into a five-year marketing agreement
the SMS Agreement with Shared Medical Systems SMS that grants to SMS
worldwide marketing rights to certain of the Company products for sales to
providers and combined provider/payor organizations. Under the terms of the SMS
Agreement, the Company provides to SMS initial modifications, training, product
development, support, and marketing assistance. Payments to the Company under
the SMS Agreement relate to sub-licensing of the product to end-users, the
performance of a set of initial software changes by the Company, and the
provision of support, marketing and training services to SMS. Under the
licensing provisions, the Company granted up to 30 licenses to SMS for
sub-licensing. The Company recognizes revenues for DIAMOND 725 licenses upon
execution of license agreement between SMS and the end-user. DIAMOND 950C/S
licenses are recognized upon successful implementation of the system at end-user
sites. For term license agreements, the Company recognizes revenue ratability
over the term of the license agreement between SMS and the end-user, which term
typically extends five to seven years. For licenses after the first 30 licenses
under the original agreement, SMS pays the Company a percentage of the license
fee charged to the end-user. SMS must also pay HSD a percentage of all support
fees paid to SMS by its end-users. Under the development provisions, the Company
is obligated to perform a set of software enhancements for which the Company
will be paid upon the achievement of certain milestones. The Company is
recognizing revenues from this development arrangement under the
percentage-of-completion method. The costs incurred under the development
arrangement are included in product development in the accompanying statements
of operations.
The Company recognized revenues under the SMS Agreement of approximately
$415,000, $1,402,000, and $1,722,000 in fiscal year 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. This was approximately 2 percent, 11 percent, and 25 percent of
total revenues in fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Accounts receivable
under the SMS Agreement were approximately $253,000 and $374,000 at September
30, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Billings under the Agreement are made upon the
achievement of certain performance milestones. Unbilled revenue under the SMS
Agreement was approximately $437,000 and $687,000 at September 30, 1997 and
1996, respectively. Unearned revenue was $0 and $345,000 at September 30, 1997
and 1996, respectively. Subsequent to year-end the Company entered into an
amendment to the SMS Agreement see Note 12.
For the year ended September 30, 1997, revenues under the above-mentioned
agreements, combined with revenues from the next largest customer were 45
percent of the Company revenues. No other single customer accounted for more
than 10 percent of total revenues in fiscal 1997, 1996 or 1995.
9. RETIREMENT PLAN:
The Company maintains a 401k retirement plan the Plan for full-time
employees. The plan year is from January 1 to December 31, and the discretionary
employer contribution is established at the end of the plan year. Participants
become fully vested after four years of service, although they vest
incrementally on an annual basis until the four-year period is completed. No
contributions were made during the fiscal years ended September 30, 1997 and
1996.

10. STOCK OPTION PLAN AND WARRANTS:
Effective August 5, 1994, the Company implemented a stock option plan. The
Company has reserved 500,000 shares of stock for grants, but the plan is no
longer issuing options since the inception of the 1996 Ominbus Plan.
On January 2, 1996, the Board of Directors authorized the 1996 Omnibus
Equity Incentive Plan, under which the Company is authorized to grant up to
900,000 shares of common stock to employees and consultants of the Company. The
plan allows incentive stock options to be granted to employees only, while
nonstatutory stock options may be granted to both employees and consultants.
Under the terms of the plan, incentive stock options to purchase shares of the
Company common stock must be granted at a price equal to the market price of
the stock at the date of grant, except for employees who, prior to the grant,
own more than 10 percent of the voting power of all stock. The exercise price
for such employees must be no less than 110 percent of the market price. For
nonstatutory stock options, the exercise price for both employees and
consultants will be no less than 85 percent of the market price. Both incentive
stock options and nonstatutory stock options may be exercised within ten years
from the date of grant, except for employees and consultants who own more than
10 percent of the voting power of all classes of stock, in which case the
options may be exercised within a five-year period. Options generally vest over
a five-year period.
In October 1996 the Company Board of Directors approved the issuance of
300,000 shares under the Health Systems Design Corporation Employee Stock
Purchase Plan. The Plan allows for employees to purchase the Company common
stock at a 15% discount off the stock market value as defined under the Plan.
The Company accounts for these plans under APB Opinion No. 25, under which
$78,795 was charged to deferred compensation in the year ended September 30,
1995 because certain options were granted at below the then fair market value of
the common stock. This deferred compensation is being amortized over the vesting
period of the related options. Amortization of Deferred Compensation was $15,760
for each of the years ended Sept. 30, 1997 and 1996 and no other compensation
cost has been recognized under APB Opinion No. 25 as all other options have been
granted at an option exercise price equal to the market value of common stock on
the date of grant. Had compensation cost for these plans been determined
consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company net loss in total and per share
would have been changed to the following pro forma amounts:
YEAR ENDED SEPT. 30,
1997     1996
Net  As Reported   3,856,304 1,207,946
Pro Forma    4,180,109 1,376,354
Primary  As Reported      060    021
Pro Forma       065    024
Fully Diluted  As Reported      060    021
Pro Forma       065    024
Because the SFAS No. 123 method of accounting has not been applied to
options granted prior to October 1, 1995, the resulting pro forma compensation
cost may not be representative of that to be expected in future years.

-   1,073,630
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in 1997 and 1996, respectively: risk-free weighted
average interest rate of 611 and 655 percent, expected dividend yields of 0
percent, expected lives of 5 years from the date of grant and expected
volatility of 103%.
In a December 1995 private placement, the Company issued $2,000,000 in notes
with warrants to purchase 200,000 shares of the Company common stock at $500
per share. Upon repayment of the notes, the note holders executed warrants to
purchase 95,000 shares of the Company common stock. At September 30, 1996 and
1997, warrants to purchase 105,000 shares of the Company common stock were
outstanding.

11. PUBLIC OFFERING
On March 5, 1996, the Company sold 1,855,000 shares of its common stock
through an initial public offering. As a result, the Company received net
proceeds of $21,722,965. A portion of the proceeds was immediately used to
retire short-term and long-term indebtedness to banks and other creditors. In
connection with the repayment of the private placement notes payable of
$2,000,000 of which $600,000 was paid to a stockholder, the Company recorded a
one-time, non-cash charge to interest expense of approximately $350,000 in
fiscal 1996 to reflect the write-off of deferred interest.
12. SUBSEQUENT EVENT
On December 23, 1997, the Company executed an amendment to the SMS Agreement
for the purpose of resolving certain disagreements between the parties and
jointly pursuing opportunities in the European payor organization markets,
amongst other matters. The amendment provides for a $4 million credit pool
against which SMS may charge billings for services rendered by the Company, as
well as future royalties payable by SMS to license the Diamond products in
Europe. Because of the credit pool, the Company is not expected to generate
significant revenues from SMS in the near future. In addition, the Company has
agreed to provide certain services and enhancements to the Diamond software for
SMS payor markets. In return, SMS will undertake significant investments in
the European payor organization markets and has agreed not to initiate
litigation for certain matters, provided the Company satisfies specified
obligations. As a result of this amendment, the Company accrued approximately
$800,000 as of September 30, 1997 to cover anticipated costs related to
performance disagreements under the original SMS Agreement.
