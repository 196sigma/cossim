Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   41                   Page 35             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Resonate Inc. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Resonate Inc. at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
listed in the index appearing under Item 14a2 on page 69 presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    THE COMPANY
Resonate Inc. the Company was incorporated in July 1995 under the laws
of the State of California. The Company develops and markets a family of
software products and services that ensure high levels of availability and
performance for Internet, intranet and extranet applications. The Company
family of software products integrates network traffic management and systems
monitoring and management functions, which together provide real time
monitoring, reporting and automated service level control of eBusiness
applications.
REINCORPORATION
In March 2000, the Company Board of Directors authorized and in July
2000, the stockholders approved the reincorporation of the Company in the State
of Delaware. As a result of the reincorporation, the Company is authorized to
issue 200,000,000 shares of $00001 par value Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares
of $00001 par value Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors has the authority
to issue undesignated Preferred Stock in one or more series and to fix the
rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof. Share and per share
information for each of the periods presented has been retroactively adjusted to
reflect the reincorporation.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts
of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. The functional currency of the Company
foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. Accordingly, the Company applies the
current exchange rate to translate foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities
and weighted average exchanges rate to translate the subsidiaries' revenues,
expenses, gains and losses into United States dollars. Translation adjustments
are immaterial and are included in the consolidated statements of operations.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company derives revenue from licenses of its software and related
services, which include implementation and integration services, technical
services, training and consulting. Revenue is recognized when there is
persuasive evidence of an arrangement for a fixed and determinable fee that is
probable of collection and when delivery and installation has occurred. We
generally recognize revenue under the residual method as prescribed by Statement
of Position No. 97-2 Software Revenue Recognition and Statement of Position
No. 98-9 Modification of SOP No. 97-2 with Respect for Certain Transactions
whereby revenue is allocated to each undelivered element based upon the fair
value of each element when sold separately and the residual amount is then
allocated to the delivered element.
The Company has also entered into a limited number of contracts which
involve significant implementation or customization essential to the
functionality of our product. Product and services revenue under such
arrangements is recognized under the percentage-of-completion method using labor                   Page 41 hours incurred as the measure of progress towards completion. The Company
classifies revenue from these arrangements as product and services revenue,
respectively, based upon the estimated fair value of each element. Provisions
for estimated contract losses are recognized in the period in which the loss
becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated.
Product revenue from existing reseller arrangements is recognized when
reported by the reseller upon re-licensing of the Company software to
end-users. The Company agreements with its customers and resellers do not
contain product return rights.
For arrangements with extended payment terms, revenue is recognized at the
earlier of when the payment is due or when the cash is received.
The Company also derives revenue from providing access to our products for
a specified period of time. Revenue is recognized on such arrangements as the
license fees become due and payable. No revenue was recognized under such
arrangements during 1999. For the year ended December 31, 2000, revenue
recognized under such arrangements was not significant.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101, or SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements, which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and
disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the SEC. SAB 101
outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides
guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies. We have
complied with the guidance in SAB 101.
Services revenue consists of professional services and maintenance fees.
Professional services primarily consist of software installation and
integration, consulting and training. Professional services revenue is
recognized as such services are performed. Services revenue from maintenance
agreements, which include services such as technical product support and
unspecified product upgrades, are recognized ratably over the term of the
agreement, generally one year.
CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash
equivalents; those with original maturities greater than three months and
current maturities less than twelve months from the balance sheet date are
considered short-term investments. Cash equivalents and short-term investments
are considered available-for-sale securities and are carried at cost, which
approximates fair value. The Company investment portfolio consists of both
fixed and variable rate financial instruments, including commercial paper, money
market funds, government agency securities and highly rated corporate bonds and
notes.
The following schedule summarizes the estimated fair value of the Company
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in thousands                              DECEMBER 31,

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of
credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and
accounts receivable. The Company limits its exposure to credit loss by placing
its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments with major financial
institutions. The Company accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned
from customers located primarily in the U.S., and to a lesser extent, in Brazil,
Canada, Europe and Asia. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers' financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its
customers. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable
based upon the expected collectibility of accounts receivable.
During the year ended December 31, 2000, one individual customer accounted
for 15% of the Company total revenue. During the years ended December 31, 1999
and 1998, respectively, no individual customer accounted for more than 10% of
the Company total revenue.
At December 31, 2000, no individual customers accounted for more than 10%
of total accounts receivable. At December 31, 1999, one individual customer
accounted for 16% of total accounts receivable.
FAIR VALUE OF INSTRUMENTS
The Company financial instruments including cash equivalents, short-term
investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable, are carried at cost,
which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these
instruments. Debt and capital lease obligations are carried at cost, which
approximates fair value due to the proximity of the implicit rates of these
financial instruments and the prevailing market rates for similar instruments.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using
the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets, generally three to
five years, or the lease term of the respective assets, whichever is shorter.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Software development costs incurred in the research and development of new
products and enhancements to existing products are charged to expense as
incurred. Software development costs are capitalized after technological
feasibility has been established. The period between achievement of
technological feasibility which the Company defines as the establishment of a
working model, until the general availability of such software to customers, has
been short and software development costs qualifying for capitalization have
been insignificant. Accordingly, the Company has not capitalized any software
development costs since its inception.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees in accordance with
the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and complies with the disclosure                   Page 43 provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No. 123. Under APB 25, unearned stock-
based compensation is based on the difference, if any, on the date of the grant,
between the fair value of the Company stock and the exercise price. Unearned
stock-based compensation is amortized and expensed in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 28 using the multiple-option
approach. The Company accounts for stock issued to non-employees in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and the Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus
on Issue No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other
Than Employees for Acquiring or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services.
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value options granted
to consultants.
NET LOSS PER SHARE
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to
common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period excluding shares of common stock
subject to repurchase. Diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss
per share because the calculation of diluted net loss per share excludes
potential shares of common stock since their effect is antidilutive.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net
loss per share available to common stockholders for the periods indicated in
thousands, except per share amounts                                      DECEMBER 31,

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
The Company has adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. This statement requires the
disclosure of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of                   Page 44 general-purpose financial statements. Comprehensive income, as defined, includes
all changes in equity net assets during the period from non-owner sources. To
date, the Company has not had any material transactions that are required to be
reported in comprehensive income.
SEGMENT INFORMATION
During the period presented, the Company operated in a single business
segment primarily in the United States. Through December 31, 2000, foreign
operations were not significant in either revenue or investment in long-lived
assets.
RECLASSIFICATION
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements
to conform to the current period presentation.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, or SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 133 establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. In July
1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 137, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective
Date of FASB No. 133. SFAS 137 deferred the effective date of SFAS 133 until
the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2000. We will
adopt SFAS 133 in the quarter ending March 31, 2001. We did not engage in
hedging activities or invested in derivative instruments and accordingly, SFAS
133 did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation - an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25. FIN 44 FIN 44
clarifies the definition of employee for purposes of applying APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, the criteria for determining
whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan, the accounting consequence
of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or
award and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a
business combination. FIN 44 was effective July 1, 2000, but certain conclusions
cover specific events that occur after either December 15, 1998, or January 12,
2000. The adoption of FIN 44 did not have a material impact on our financial
position or results of operations. 2. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION IN THOUSANDS                                          YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

Preferred Stock were exercised, respectively.
During 1997, the Company issued 3,333 warrants to purchase Series B
Preferred Stock in connection with the equipment line of credit #2 discussed in
Note 4. The warrants had an exercise price of $135 per share. The Company
determined the value of the warrants was nominal based on the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. The warrants were fully exercised in September 2000.
In March 1998, the Company issued 9,888 warrants to purchase Series C
Preferred Stock in connection with the equipment line of credit #3 discussed in
Note 4. The warrants had an exercise price of $3034 per share. The Company

option pricing model. The warrants were fully exercised in September 2000.
In June 1998, the Company issued 65,920 warrants to purchase Common Stock
to a strategic investor. The Company determined the value of the warrants at the
date of grant based on the term using the Black Scholes option pricing model to
be approximately $17,000 using the following assumptions: 60% volatility, no
dividends and 515% risk free interest rate. The Company has not recorded any
expense for the estimated fair value of the warrants because such amounts were
insignificant. The warrants were fully exercised in connection with the
Company initial public offering.
In November 1998, the Company issued 102,999 and 26,367 warrants to
purchase Series C Preferred Stock in connection with the subordinated debt
discussed in Note 4 and capital lease obligations, respectively. The warrants
had an exercise price of $3034 per share. The estimated fair value of warrants
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model was $115,000. In 1998, the value of
warrants was recorded as deferred debt issuance costs and included in other
assets as the borrowings had yet to be drawn upon at December 31, 1998.
Beginning in 1999, amortization of the discount was recognized as interest                   Page 48 expense over the respective terms of the financing arrangements. The Company
recognized $38,333 as interest expense associated with these warrants for the
year ended December 31, 2000 and 1999. The warrants were fully exercised in

issued an additional 32,983 warrants to purchase Series C Preferred Stock in
connection with the subordinated debt. These warrants had an exercise price of
$474 per share. The estimated fair value of warrants using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model was $259,071. The fair value of the warrants will be
amortized to interest expense over the term of the subordinated debt. The
Company recognized $86,691 as interest expense associated with these warrants
for the year ended December 31, 2000 and 1999. The warrants were fully exercised
in October 2000.
In April 2000, the Company issued 77,200 warrants to purchase Common Stock
to a strategic partner. The warrants had an exercise price of $1943. The
Company determined the value of the warrants at the date of grant based on the
term using the Black-Scholes option pricing model to be approximately $464,000
using the following assumptions: 60% volatility, no dividends and a 622% risk
free interest rate. The value of the warrants will be recorded as a cost of
revenues over the term of the agreement. The warrants were fully exercised in
November 2000.
In June 2000, in connection with the bank line of credit, the Company
issued 2,774 warrants to purchase Common Stock. The warrants had an exercise
price of $1943. The Company determined the value of the warrants at the date of
grant based on the term using the Black-Scholes option pricing model to be
approximately $31,000 using the following assumptions: 60% volatility, no
dividends and a 669% risk free interest rate. The Company has not recorded any
expense for the estimated fair value of the warrants because such amounts were
insignificant. The warrants were fully exercised in September 2000. 8. COMMON STOCK   A portion of the shares issued to employees are subject to repurchase
rights by the Company over a four year period from the earlier of grant date or
employee hire date, as applicable. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, there were
1,420,000 and 2,001,000 shares subject to repurchase, at an average price of
$098 and $058 per share, respectively.
In February and September 1999, certain executives of the Company exercised
their stock options prior to vesting by issuance of full recourse promissory
notes to the Company. The notes totaling $755,000 bear interest at rates between
500% and 625% per annum and are due five years from the date of the note or
one year after the holder ceases holding a position with the Company. The notes
are collateralized by the related 1,734,244 shares of Common Stock issued, which
are subject to the Company right of repurchase. The net amount outstanding
under these notes has been reflected as a separate component of stockholders'
equity.
In February 2000, an executive of the Company exercised his stock options
in part by issuing a full recourse promissory note to the Company in the
principal amount of $300,000. The note bears interest at 66% per annum and is
due five years from the date of the note. The note is collateralized by the
related 100,000 shares of Common Stock issued, which are subject to the
Company right of repurchase. The net amount outstanding under this note has
been reflected as a separate component of stockholders' equity.                   Page 49 9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS   401K SAVINGS PLAN
The Company has a 401k Savings Plan the 401K Plan that qualifies as a
deferred salary arrangement under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code.
Under the 401K Plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 20%
of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. All employees on
the United States payroll of the Company are eligible to participate in the
Plan. The Company is not required to contribute to the 401K Plan and has made no
contributions since its inception.
STOCK OPTION PLANS
The Company maintains the 1996 Stock Option Plan the 1996 Stock Plan.
The 1996 Stock Plan provides for the granting of incentive and non-qualified
stock options to employees, consultants and directors of the Company. The total
number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of
options granted under the 1996 Stock Plan is 6,940,250 as of December 31, 2000.
Since its initial public offering in August 2000, the Company ceased granting
options under the 1996 Stock Plan.
Options under the 1996 Stock Plan may be granted at an exercise price not
less than 100% of the fair market value of the Company common stock on the
date of grant, as determined by the Board of Directors, for incentive stock
options and 85% of such fair market value for non-qualified stock options. All
options are granted at the discretion of the Company Board of Directors and
have a term not greater than ten years. For holders of more than 10% of the
Company total combined voting power of all classes of stock, incentive stock
options may not be granted at less than 110% of the fair market value of the
Company common stock at the date of grant or for a term greater than five
years. The fair market value of the Company Common Stock is determined by the
Board of Directors. Options granted under the 1996 Stock Plan typically become
exercisable at a rate of 25% after the first year and ratably over the next
three years or ratably over four years on a quarterly basis. Certain employee
options are immediately exercisable but unvested shares are subject to
repurchase by the Company at the original exercise price.
In March 2000, the Company Board of Directors adopted and in July 2000,
the Company stockholders approved the 2000 Stock Plan the 2000 Stock Plan,
which became effective upon our initial public offering in August 2000. Each
plan is administered by the Board or by a committee of the Board.
A total of 3,200,000 shares of common stock were authorized and reserved
for issuance under the 2000 Stock Plan as of December 31, 2000, plus annual
increases equal to the lesser of - 1,500,000 shares;
- 5% of the outstanding shares on such date; or
- a lesser amount to be determined by the Board.
The 2000 Stock Plan allows awards to be granted in the form of incentive stock
options, nonstatutory stock options and stock purchase rights. Unless terminated
sooner by the Board, the 2000 Stock Plan will terminate automatically in 2010.                   Page 50   The following table summarizes the activity under the 1996 Stock Plan and

At December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, approximately 419,000, 303,000 and
263,000 options were exercisable at a weighted average exercise price per share
of $312, $049 and $010, respectively.
In connection with a 1998 employment agreement with an executive the
Executive Agreement, the Company issued options to purchase 1,408,500 shares
of Common Stock outside of the Company stock option plan. The options have an
exercise price of $ 038, vest over a forty-eight month period and expire in                   Page 51 2008. During 1999, the options were exercised and 587,000 outstanding shares of
Common Stock purchased upon exercise of the option are subject to repurchase at
December 31, 2000. Upon termination of employment, unvested shares are subject
to repurchase by the Company at the original exercise price.
FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES
The Company calculated the minimum fair value of each option grant under
the Plans on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as
prescribed by SFAS No. 123 with the following assumptions                                          YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
2000      1999      1998

Weighted average fair value of options granted per share.  $  997   $  784    $  193
80%      --          Had compensation cost for options granted under the Plans and the Executive
Agreement been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for the
awards under a method prescribed by SFAS No. 123, the Company net loss would
have been increased to the pro forma amounts below for the years ended December
31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively in thousands, except per share amounts                                          YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

Net loss per share
As   $ 341   $ 418    $ 190

Because the determination of the fair value of all options granted after
the Company became a public entity included an expected volatility factor in
addition to the factors described above and because additional option grants
were made subsequent to the Company initial public offering, the compensation
expense for options granted during 2000, 1999 and 1998 are not representative of
the pro forma effects of options grants on reported net income loss for future
years.
OPTIONS ISSUED TO SERVICE PROVIDERS
Fully vested options granted include options to acquire 62,449 and 131,758
shares of common stock issued to consultants and other service providers of the
Company during the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The
fair value of the common stock options was estimated to be $709,000 and $646,000
for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, using the
Black-Scholes pricing model at the date of grant, the term of the option and the
following assumptions: Risk free rate of 61%-62 and 45%-56%, no expected
dividends and volatility of 60%.
Stock options have been granted to consultants that provide marketing,
recruiting and business advisory services to the Company. Stock-based
compensation related to stock options granted to consultants is recognized over
the term of the service agreement, which generally covers a period from three
months to two years. In connection with the grant of stock options to                   Page 52 consultants and other service providers, the Company recorded stock-based
compensation expenses of $746,000 and $646,000 for the year ended December 31,
2000 and 1999, respectively.
UNEARNED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
In connection with certain stock option grants during the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, the Company recorded unearned stock-based
compensation cost totaling $98 million, $216 million and $41 million,
respectively, which is being recognized over the vesting period of the related
options of four years. Amortization of unearned stock-based compensation totaled
$145 million, $58 million and $878,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively.
The remaining unamortized, unearned stock-based compensation for all option
grants through December 31, 2000 is expected to be amortized as follows: $84
million in 2001, $43 million in 2002, $16 million in 2003 and $55,000 in 2004.
EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
In March 2000, the Company Board of Directors adopted and in July 2000,
the Company stockholders approved the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the
ESPP, which became effective upon our initial public offering in August 2000.
The plan is administered by the Board or by a committee of the Board.
A total of 1,000,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance
under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP as of December 31, 2000, plus
annual increases equal to the lesser of - 750,000 shares;
- 25% of the outstanding shares on such date; or
- a lesser amount to be determined by the Board.
The ESPP permits participants to purchase common stock through payroll
deductions of up to 15% of the participant gross earnings and commissions, but
not to exceed the established maximum. Such amounts are applied to the purchase
from the Company of shares of common stock at the end of each offering period at
a price that is generally 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the
common stock at the beginning and at the end of the offering period. The plan
contains consecutive, overlapping 24 month offering periods. Each offering
period includes four six-month purchase periods. The plan will terminate in
2010. At December 31, 2000, no shares had been issued under the ESPP. 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   CAPITAL LEASES
The Company has entered into capital lease agreements for their office
equipment. The Company issued 26,367 warrants to purchase Series C Preferred
Stock in connection with the agreement. These warrants were fully exercised in
October 2000 see Note 7.
OPERATING LEASES
The Company leases its facilities and certain equipment under noncancelable
operating leases which expire at various dates through 2003. Rent expense under
these leases totaled approximately $1,894,000, $915,000 and $463,000 for 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively.                   Page 53   Future minimum lease payments due under capital leases and operating leases

LITIGATION
On September 12, 2000, the Company filed a complaint for patent
infringement against Alteon Web Systems, Inc. in the United States District
Court, Northern District of California. The Company believes Alteon infringes
United States Letters Patent No. 5,774,660, entitled World-Wide Web Server With
Delayed Resource-Binding For Resource-Based Load Balancing On A Distributed
Resource Multi-Node Network, which was issued to the Company on June 30, 1998.
Alteon served its answer to the Company complaint in October 2000, in which
Alteon denied the Company allegations and counterclaimed that the Company
patent is invalid. In October 2000, Alteon was acquired by Nortel Networks
Corporation. The litigation is currently in the discovery phase and a trial date
has been set for the summer of 2002.
From time to time the Company may have certain contingent liabilities that
arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. In the opinion of
management, there are no pending claims for which the outcome is expected to
result in a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of
operations or cash flows of the Company. 11. INCOME TAXES   The Company effective tax rate varies from the statutory rate as follows                                      2000      1999      1998

assets since the realization of these future benefits cannot be sufficiently
assured.
As of December 31, 2000, the Company has available net operating loss
carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately
$51,631,000 and $22,251,000, respectively. These net operating loss
carryforwards begin to expire in 2010 and 2003 for federal and state tax
purposes, respectively. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of and
benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in
certain circumstances. Events which cause limitations in the amounts of net
operating losses that the Company may utilize in any one year include, but are
not limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50% as defined, over
a three year period. Item 1.    3

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
For information regarding executive officers of the Company, see the
information appearing under the caption Executive Officers of the Registrant
in Part I, Item 4a of this Annual Report on Form 10K.
SECTION 16A BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16a of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 requires
Resonate officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent
10% of a registered class of Resonate equity securities, to file certain
reports regarding ownership of, and transactions in, Resonate securities with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such officers, directors, and 10%
stockholders are also required to furnish Resonate with copies of all Section
16a forms that they file.
Based solely on its review of copies of Forms 3 and 4 and amendments
thereto furnished to Resonate pursuant to Rule 16a-3e of Regulation S-K,
Resonate believes that during fiscal year 2000, all filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission of its officers, directors and 10% stockholders complied
with requirements for reporting ownership and changes in ownership of Resonate
Common Stock pursuant to Section 16a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
