53           REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To Rush Enterprises, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rush
Enterprises, Inc. a Texas corporation, and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1997 and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1998. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Rush Enterprises, Inc., and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1998, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                         ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP  San Antonio, Texas

60 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Estimates in Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined
by specific identification for new and used truck and construction equipment
inventory and by utilizing the first-in, first-out methods for tires, parts and
accessories.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are being depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the useful life of the improvement, or
the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Both the straight-line and double
declining-balance methods of depreciation are used. The cost, accumulated
depreciation and amortization and estimated useful lives are summarized as
follows in thousands                           December 31,    Estimated
1997    1998   Life Years

Accumulated depreciation and amortization     7,534  10,627
$ 34,158  $ 54,448
Allowance for Doubtful Receivables
and Repossession Losses       
The Company provides an allowance for doubtful receivables and repossession
losses after considering historical loss experience and other factors which
might affect the collectibility of accounts receivable and the ability of
customers to meet their obligations on finance contracts sold by the Company.
Other Assets
Other assets primarily consist of goodwill related to acquisitions, of
approximately $127 million and $151 million, as of December 31, 1997 and 1998,
respectively , and long-term deposits. The goodwill is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of 30 years. Accumulated
amortization of other assets, at December 31, 1997 and 1998, was approximately
$05 million and $11 million, respectively. Periodically, the Company assesses
the appropriateness of the asset valuations of goodwill and the related
amortization period.                    60
61 Income Taxes
Effective with the corporate reorganization on June 12, 1996 see note 3, the
Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109. SFAS 109 requires recognition
of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences
of events that have been included in a company financial statements or tax
returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined
based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets
and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the years in
which the differences are expected to reverse.
Revenue Recognition Policies
Income on the sale of vehicles and construction equipment collectively,
unitis recognized when the seller and customer execute a purchase contract
and there are no significant uncertainties related to financing or delivery.
Finance income related to the sale of a unit is recognized over the period of
the respective finance contract on the effective interest rate method if the
finance contract is retained by the Company. During 1996, 1997 and 1998, no
finance contracts were retained for any significant length of time by the
Company but were generally sold, with limited recourse, to certain finance
companies concurrent with the sale of the related unit. Gain or loss is
recognized by the Company upon the sale of such finance contracts to the finance
companies, net of a provision for estimated repossession losses and early
repayment penalties. Lease and rental income is recognized over the period of
the related lease or rental agreement. Parts and services revenue is earned at
the time the Company sells the parts to its customers, or at the time the
Company completes the service work order related to service provided to the
customer unit. Retail revenue is earned at the time the Company sells the
merchandise to its customer.
Statement of Cash Flows
Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash and other money market
instruments. The Company considers any temporary investments that mature in
three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents for reporting cash
flows.
Noncash activities during the periods indicated were as follows in thousands                                   Year Ended December 31,

In February 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132, Employers' Disclosures
about Pensions and Other Post retirement Benefits SFAS 132. SFAS 132
standardizes the disclosure requirements for pensions and other post retirement
benefits to the extent practicable, requires additional information on changes
in the benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets, and eliminates
certain disclosures that are no longer useful. This statement is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. The Company does not provide
post retirement or post employment benefits to its employees.
In April 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee AcSEC issued
Statement of Position 98-5 Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities SOP
98-5. SOP 98-5 requires all start-up activities, as defined, to be expensed as
incurred. SOP 98-5 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1998. Earlier                     61
62 application is encouraged, initial application will be reported as a cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle and restatement of previously issued
financial statements is not permitted. SOP 98-5 will not have a material impact
on the financial statements of the Company. 3. INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING AND
CORPORATE REORGANIZATION The Company filed a Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for an underwritten offering of 2,875,000 shares of common stock,
including underwriters' overallotment option, which became effective on June 12,
1996 the Offering. The Company used the net proceeds of the Offering to retire
certain debt obligations, fund potential acquisition opportunities which may
arise in the future and for general corporate purposes.
As part of the Offering on June 12, 1996, the Company terminated its S
corporation federal tax election and was subject to federal and certain state
income taxes from that date forward. On June 12, 1996, the Company paid the S
corporation shareholder approximately $86 million representing the
undistributed accumulated earnings of the S corporation prior to June 12, 1996.
Following the offering, there were 6,625,000 common shares outstanding,
including 3,750,000 owned by the shareholder of the predecessor S corporation.
The weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding as of December
31, 1997 and 1998, was 6,643,730.
Dividends declared, paid or payable for the years ended December 31, 1995 and
1996, were related to the Company sole shareholder prior to the reorganization
and Offering.
As part of the reorganization, the Company acquired, as a wholly owned
subsidiary, a managing general agent the MGA to manage all of the operations
of Associated Acceptance, Inc. AA. The MGA is responsible for funding the
operations of AA, directing the use of AA assets and incurring liabilities on
AA behalf in exchange for the MGA receiving any and all net income of AA. W.
Marvin Rush, the sole shareholder of AA, is prohibited from the sale or transfer
of the capital stock of AA under the MGA agreement, except as designated by the
Company. Therefore, the financial position and operations of AA have been
included as part of the Company consolidated financial position and results of
operations. 4. PRO FORMA INFORMATION UNAUDITED Pro Forma Income and Pro Forma Income Per Share Unaudited
Pro forma income and pro forma income per share have been determined assuming
that the Company had been taxed as a C corporation for federal and certain state
income tax purposes since January 1, 1996.                    62
63 5. SUPPLIER AND CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION Major Suppliers and Dealership Agreements
The Company has entered into dealership agreements with various companies
Distributors. These agreements are nonexclusive agreements that allow the
Company to stock, sell at retail and service trucks and products of the
Distributors in the Company defined market. The agreements allow the Company
to use the Distributor name, trade symbols and intellectual property and
expire as follows Distributor              Expiration Dates
PACCAR               March 2000 to
October 2000
GMC                 October 2000
Volvo                March 2000
John Deere             Indefinite These agreements impose a number of restrictions and obligations on the Company,
including restrictions on a change in control of the Company and the maintenance
of certain required levels of working capital. Violation of such restrictions
could result in the loss of the Company right to purchase the Distributor
products and use the Distributor trademarks. As of December 31, 1998, the
Company management believes it was in compliance with all the restrictions of
its dealership agreements.
The Company purchases most of its new vehicles and parts from PACCAR, the maker
of Peterbilt trucks and parts, at prevailing prices charged to all franchised
dealers. Sales of new Peterbilt trucks accounted for 98 percent and 97 percent
of the Company new vehicle sales for the years ended December 31, 1997 and
1998, respectively.
The Company purchases most of its new construction equipment and parts from John
Deere, at prevailing prices charged to all franchised dealers. Sales of new John
Deere equipment accounted for 88 percent of the Company new equipment sales
for the year ended December 31, 1998.
Primary Lenders
The Company purchases its new and used truck and construction equipment
inventories with the assistance of floor plan financing programs offered by
various financial institutions and John Deere. The financial institution used
for truck inventory purchases also provides the Company with a line of credit
which allows borrowings of up to $8,000,000 and other variable interest rate
notes. The loan agreement with the financial institution, used for truck
inventory purchases, provides that such agreement may be terminated at the
option of the lender with notice of 120 days.
The loan agreement with the financial institution used primarily for
construction equipment purchases expires in September 1999. Additionally,
financing is provided by John Deere pursuant to the Company equipment
dealership agreement. Furthermore, the agreements also provide that the
occurrence of certain events will be considered events of default. In the event
that the Company financing becomes insufficient, or its relationship
terminates with the current primary lenders, the Company would need to obtain
similar financing from other sources. Management believes it can obtain
additional floor plan financing or alternative financing if necessary. see note
8.
Concentrations of Credit Risks
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents
and accounts receivable.                    63
64
The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with what it considers to be
quality financial institutions. At December 31, 1998, the Company had deposits
in excess of federal insurance totaling approximately $7,011,000.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are reduced
because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the Company
customer base, thus, spreading the trade credit risk. A majority of the
Company business, however, is concentrated in the United States heavy-duty
trucking and construction equipment markets and related aftermarkets. The
Company controls credit risk through credit approvals and by selling certain
trade receivables without recourse. Related to the Company finance contracts,
after the finance contract is entered into, the Company generally sells the
contracts to a third party. The finance contracts are sold both with and without
recourse, but the annual amount of recourse losses which can be put to the
Company is contractually limited. See note 16. Historically, bad debt expense
associated with the Company accounts receivable and finance contracts has not
been material.
6. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE The Company accounts receivable, net, consisted of the following in
thousands                                   December 31,

8. FLOOR PLAN NOTES PAYABLE AND LINES OF CREDIT Floor Plan Notes Payable
Floor plan notes are financing agreements to facilitate the Company purchase
of new and used trucks and construction equipment. These notes are
collateralized by the inventory purchased and accounts receivable arising from
the sale thereof. The Company floor plan notes have interest rates at prime
less a percentage rate as determined by the finance provider, as defined in the
agreements. The interest rates applicable to these agreements were 725 to 75
percent as of December 31, 1998. The amounts borrowed under these agreements are
due when the related truck or construction equipment inventory collateral is
sold and the sales proceeds are collected by the Company, or in the case of
construction equipment rentals, when the carrying value of the equipment is
reduced. These lines may be modified, suspended, or terminated by the lender as
described in note 5.
The Company floor plan agreement with its primary truck lender limits the
borrowing capacity based on the number of new and used trucks that may be
financed. As of December 31, 1998, the aggregate amounts of unit capacity for
new and used trucks are 1,133 and 432, respectively, and the availability for
new and used trucks is 679 and 105, respectively.
The Company floor plan agreement with its primary construction equipment
lender is based on the book value of the Company construction equipment
inventory. As of December 31, 1998, the aggregate amount of borrowing capacity
with the Company primary lender, was $25 million, with approximately $216
million outstanding. Additional amounts are available under the Company John
Deere dealership agreement. At December 31, 1998, approximately $217 million
was outstanding pursuant to the John Deere dealership agreement.
Amounts of collateral as of December 31, 1998, are as follows in thousands

Floor plan notes payable                   $  89,212
Lines of Credit
The Company has a separate line-of-credit agreement with a financial institution
which provides for an aggregate maximum borrowing of $8,000,000, with advances
generally limited to 75 percent of new parts inventory. Advances bear interest
at prime. Advances under the line-of-credit agreement are secured by new parts
inventory. The line-of-credit agreement contains financial covenants. The
Company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 1998. Either
party may terminate the agreement with 30 days written notice. As of December
31, 1997 and 1998, advances outstanding under the various line-of-credit
agreements amounted to $20,000 and $10,000, respectively. As of December 31,
1998, $7,990,000 was available for future borrowings. This line is discretionary
and may be modified, suspended or terminated at the election of the lender.
Note payable to shareholder is a short-term note that is payable on demand and
bears interest equal to one percent per annum less than the rate of interest
received by the Company under its agreement to deposit overnight funds in
interest bearing accounts with one of the Company floor plan lenders.                    65

10. DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS In December 1991, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107,
Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments, SFAS 107 was issued.
SFAS 107 requires disclosures of the fair value of financial instruments. The
following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each
class of financial instrument held by the Company     Current assets and current liabilities - The carrying value
approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these items.
Long-term debt - The fair value of the Company long-term debt is
based on secondary market indicators. Since the Company debt is not
quoted, estimates are based on each obligation characteristics,
including remaining maturities, interest rate, credit rating,
collateral, amortization schedule and liquidity. The carrying amount
approximates fair value.                    66

11. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLANS The Company has a defined contribution pension plan the Rush Plan which is
available to all Company employees and the employees of certain affiliates. As
of December 31 of every year, each employee who has completed one year of
continuous service is entitled to enter the Rush Plan. Participating employees
may contribute from 2 percent to 10 percent of total gross compensation. The
Company, at its discretion, contributed an amount equal to 25 percent of the
employees' contributions for those employees with less than five years of
service and contributed an amount equal to 50 percent of the employees'
contributions for those employees with more than 5 years of service. During the
years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, the Company incurred expenses of
approximately $166,000, $215,000 and $648,000, respectively, related to the Rush
Plan.
Through March 1998, South Coast Peterbilt also had a defined contribution
pension plan the South Coast Plan which was available to all employees of
South Coast Peterbilt. Effective April 1, 1998 the South Coast Plan was
terminated at which time all eligible South Coast employees were permitted to
enter the Rush Plan. During the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998,
South Coast incurred expenses of approximately $185,000, $151,000 and $46,000,
respectively, related to the South Coast Plan.

under operating lease arrangements. This equipment is subleased to customers
under various agreements in its own leasing operation. Generally, the Company is
required to incur all operating costs and pay a minimum rental and an excess

13. STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS In October 1995, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123, was issued. SFAS 123
defines a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options or
similar equity instruments and encourages all entities to adopt that method of
accounting for all of their employee stock compensation plans. Under the fair
value based method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the
value of the award and is recognized over the service period of the award, which
is usually the vesting period. However, SFAS 123 also allows entities to
continue to measure compensation costs for employee stock compensation plans
using the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25. Because the Company has
elected to continue to follow APB 25, SFAS 123 requires disclosure of pro forma
net income and earnings per share as if the new fair value accounting method was
adopted. The Company has presented the pro forma information required by SFAS
123.
In April 1996, the Board of Directors and shareholders adopted the Rush
Enterprises, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan the Incentive Plan. The Incentive
Plan provides for the grant of stock options which may be nonqualified stock
options or incentive stock options for tax purposes, stock appreciation rights
issued independent of or in tandem with such options SARs, restricted stock
awards and performance awards.                    68
69
The aggregate number of shares of common stock subject to stock options or SARs
that may be granted to any one participant in any one year under the Incentive
Plan is 100,000 shares. The Company has 650,000 shares of common stock reserved
for issuance upon exercise of any awards granted under the Company Incentive
Plan.
In connection with the Offering, the Company agreed to issue to the
Representatives of the Underwriters and their designees, for their own accounts,
warrants to purchase an aggregate of 250,000 shares of common stock. The
warrants are exercisable during the four-year period commencing June 12, 1997,
at an exercise price equal to $1440 per share.
In April 1996, the Company granted options under the Incentive Plan to purchase
an aggregate of 19,403 shares to 18 employees, all of which are fully vested.
On April 8, 1996, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend of
one common share purchase right a Right for each share of common stock
outstanding. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the
Company one share of common stock at a price of $3500 per share the Purchase
Price. The Rights are not exercisable until the distribution date, as defined.
The Rights will expire on April 7, 2006 the Final Expiration Date, unless the
Final Expiration Date is extended or unless the Rights are earlier redeemed or
exchanged by the Company.
In March 1998 and 1997, the Company granted options under the Incentive Plan to
purchase an aggregate of 168,140 and 103,013 shares, respectively, of common
stock to employees. Each option granted shall become exercisable in three annual
installments beginning on the third anniversary of the date of grant. The
options are exercisable at a price equal to the fair value of the Company
common stock at the date of grant.
During 1997, the Board of Directors and shareholders adopted the Rush
Enterprises, Inc. 1997 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan the Director
Plan. The Director Plan is designed to attract and retain highly qualified
non-employee directors, reserving 100,000 shares of common stock for issuance
upon exercise of any awards granted under the Plan. Under the terms of this
plan, each non-employee director received options to purchase 10,000 shares as
of the date of adoption or on their respective date of election, all of which
are fully vested and are exercisable immediately, and expire ten years from the
date of grant. During each of the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, 30,000
options were granted and exercisable at a price equal to the fair values of the
Company common stock at the dates of grant. None of these options have been
exercised as of December 31, 1998.

71 If the Company had adopted the fair value accounting method under SFAS 123, the
Company net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro
forma amounts indicated below                     1996      1997      1998

Pro forma                 $      94$    79$159 The fair value of these options was estimated using a Black-Scholes option
pricing model with a risk-free interest rate of 55%, a volatility factor of
422, a dividend yield of 0%, and an expected option life of seven years. There
were no options granted under the Incentive Plan or the Director Plan during
1996. In October 1997, the Company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 171,875
shares of common stock to C. Jim Stewart & Stevenson in connection with the
purchase of the assets of the John Deere construction equipment store. The
warrants are exercisable during the five-year period commencing October 6, 1998,
at an exercise price equal to $1200 per share. None of these warrants have been
exercised as of December 31, 1998.
In March 1998, the Company issued options to purchase an aggregate of 109,973
shares of common stock to the seller in connection with the purchase of the
stock of D & D Farm and Ranch Supermarket, Inc. The options are exercisable in
four annual installments beginning on the second anniversary of the date of
grant, at exercise prices equal to $938, $1438 and $1938 per share. None of
these options have been exercised as of December 31, 1998.                    71
72 14. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share for all periods have been restated to reflect the adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share, SFAS
128 which established standards for computing and presenting earnings per share
EPS for entities with publicly held common stock or potential common stock.
This statement requires dual presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face
of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures. Basic
EPS were computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS differs from
basic EPS due to the assumed conversions of potentially dilutive options and
warrants that were outstanding during the period. The following is a
reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the basic and diluted
per-share computations for net income.                                1997     1998
Numerator:
Numerator for basic and dilutive earnings per share-
Net income available to common shareholders     $ 5,380,000  $10,797,000
Denominator:

Warrants                           --      925
Dilutive potential common shares               1,503    26,249
Denominator for diluted earnings per share--adjusted
weighted-average shares and assumed conversions     6,645,233   6,669,979
Basic earnings per share                 $    81  $   162
Diluted earnings per share                $    81  $   162
There were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding as of December 31,
1996. Warrants and options to purchase shares of common stock that were
outstanding for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, that were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise
prices were greater that the average market prices of the common shares, are as
follows                       1996       1997       1998
Warrants                   250,000     421,875     421,875
Options                      --     123,313     283,113
Total antidilutive securities        250,000     545,188     704,988
15. INCOME TAXES Prior to the Offering of the Company common stock, the Company maintained the
status of S corporation for federal and state income tax purposes. As an S
corporation, the Company was generally not responsible for income taxes.
Upon the closing of the Offering, the Company S corporation election
terminated and the Company was reorganized as described in Note 3. Accordingly,
the Company became subject to federal and state income taxes from that date
forward.                    72
73
Upon the Company termination of its S corporation status, the Company provided
deferred income taxes for cumulative temporary differences between the tax basis
and financial reporting basis of its assets and liabilities at the date of
termination.
Provision for Income Taxes
The unaudited pro forma provision for income taxes represents the estimated

74 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is contingently liable to finance companies for the notes sold to
such finance companies related to the sale of trucks and construction equipment.
The Company recourse liability related to sold finance contracts is limited to
15 to 25 percent of the outstanding amount of each note sold to the finance
company with the aggregate recourse liability for 1998 being limited to
$600,000. The Company provides an allowance for repossession losses and early
repayment penalties.
Finance contracts sold during the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998,
were $76,390,000, $91,445,000 and $183,639,000, respectively.
The Company is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of business. The Company believes it is unlikely that the final
outcome of any of the claims or proceedings to which the Company is a party
would have a material adverse effect on the Company financial position or
results of operations, however, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation,
there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or
proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on the Company results of
operations for the fiscal period in which such resolution occurred.
The Company has consulting agreements with individuals for an aggregate monthly
payment of $25,725. The agreements expire in 1999 through 2001.
17. ACQUISITIONS In March 1997, the Company purchased the assets of Denver Peterbilt, Inc., which
consisted of two full-service Peterbilt dealerships in Denver and Greeley,
Colorado. The purchase price was approximately $79 million, funded by i $65
million of cash and ii $14 million of borrowings under the Company floor
plan financing arrangement with GMAC to purchase new and used truck and parts
inventory. The Company also entered into an agreement whereby the principal of
Denver Peterbilt, Inc. may receive additional amounts based on future sales of
new Peterbilt trucks at the Colorado locations, through March 1999. The
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase.
In October 1997, the Company purchased certain assets and assumed certain
liabilities of C. Jim Stewart & Stevenson, Inc., which consisted of one
full-service John Deere construction equipment dealership in Houston, Texas. The
purchase price was approximately $302 million , funded by i $4 million of
cash, ii $211 million of borrowings under the Company floor plan financing
arrangements, iii $3,080,000 in real estate borrowings from a financial
institution, and iv a $2,062,500 promissory note payable to the seller. The
Company also issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 171,875 shares of
common stock to C. Jim Stewart & Stevenson. The warrants are exercisable during
the four-year period commencing October 6, 1998, at an exercise price equal to
$1200 per share. As the fair value of the warrants was immaterial, it was not
included in the purchase price. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase.
In March 1998, the Company caused its wholly owned subsidiary, Rush Retail
Centers of Texas, Inc., to acquire the stock of D & D Farm and Ranch
Supermarket, Inc. for approximately $105 million, with the purchase price being
a combination of cash and notes payable. The Company also issued options to
purchase an aggregate of 109,973 shares of common stock to the seller. The
options are exercisable during the four-year period commencing March 2, 2000, at
exercise prices ranging from $938 to $1938 per share. As the fair value of the
options was immaterial, it was not included in the purchase price.                    74

Klooster Equipment, Inc. which consisted of three full-service John Deere
construction equipment dealerships and one retail only location covering 54
counties in Western Michigan. The purchase price was approximately $131 million

The following unaudited pro forma summary presents information as if the Denver
Peterbilt, Inc. acquisition, and the C. Jim Stewart & Stevenson acquisition had
occurred at the beginning of fiscal year 1996 and as if the D & D Farm and Ranch
Supermarket, Inc. and the Klooster Equipment, Inc. acquisitions had taken place
at the beginning of fiscal year 1997. The pro forma information is provided for
information purposes only. It is based on historical information and does not
necessarily reflect the actual results that would have occurred nor is it
necessarily indicative of future results of operations of the Company. In
preparing the pro forma data, adjustments have been made to reflect the impact
of income tax expense for 1996 and the weighted average common shares
outstanding used in the computation of income per share has been increased to
reflect the number of shares at the Offering price necessary to fund repayment
of the line of credit drawn to pay the $6 million distribution of undistributed
S corporation earnings. The following summary is for the years ended December

The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 131 Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information SFAS 131. This statement requires that public business
enterprises report certain information about operating segments in complete sets
of financial statements of the enterprise and in condensed financial statements
of interim periods issued to shareholders. It also requires that public business
enterprises report certain information about their products and services, the
geographic areas in which they operate, and their major customers. The effective
date for SFAS No. 131 is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997.
The Company has two reportable segments: the Heavy Duty Truck segment and the
Construction Equipment segment. The Heavy Duty Truck segment operates a regional
network of truck centers that provide an integrated one-stop source for the
trucking needs of its customers, including retail sales of new Peterbilt and
used heavy-duty trucks, after-market parts, service and body shop facilities,
and a wide array of financial services, including the financing of new and used
truck purchases, insurance products and truck leasing and rentals. The
Construction Equipment segment, formed during 1997, operates a full-service John
Deere dealership that serves the Houston, Texas Metropolitan and surrounding
areas. Dealership operations include the retail sale of new and used equipment,
after-market parts and service facilities, equipment rentals, and the financing
of new and used equipment. The Company had only one segment prior to the 1997
John Deere acquisition, and all of the 1996 results depict only the Heavy Duty
Truck segment.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates performance
based on income before income taxes not including extraordinary items.
The Company accounts for intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales or
transfers were to third parties, that is, at current market prices. There were
no material intersegment sales during the years ended December 31, 1997 and
1998.                    76
77
The Company reportable segments are strategic business units that offer
different products and services. They are managed separately because each
business requires different technology and marketing strategies. Business units
were maintained through expansion and acquisitions. The following table contains
summarized information about reportable segment profit or loss and segment
assets, for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998 in thousands                      HEAVY-DUTY CONSTRUCTION
