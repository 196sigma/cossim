Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Our consolidated balance sheets as of December30, 2006 and December31, 2005 and the
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income loss, stockholders equity and cash
flows for each of the three years ending in the period December30, 2006, together with the related
notes and the report of our independent auditors, are on the following pages. Additional required
financial information is described in . 46 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of IRIDEX Corporation In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of IRIDEX Corporation and
its subsidiaries at December30, 2006 and December31, 2005, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December30, 2006 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under a2 presents fairly in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. As discussed in Note 1, the Company will not be
in compliance with certain debt covenants as
of the quarter ended March31, 2007 and does not have available resources to repay the debt if
required to do so by the lender which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the
manner in which it accounts for stock-based compensation in 2006. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. IRIDEX Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Business of the Company Description of Business IRIDEX Corporation is a worldwide provider of therapeutic based laser systems and delivery
devices used to treat eye diseases in ophthalmology and skin conditions in dermatology. Our
products are sold in the United States predominately through a direct sales force and
internationally through 77 independent distributors into 107 countries. The Companys financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which
contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the
normal course of business. The Company does
not expect that current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, revenue
expected to be generated from operations and available credit facilities, if any, will be
sufficient to meet the Companys planned operating requirements for the next 12months. The
Company expects that for our first fiscal quarter ending March31, 2007 the Company will not be
able to satisfy certain restrictive covenants contained in credit facilities with Mid-Peninsula
Bank and the Export-Import Bank see Note 11. As of March30,
2007 we have drawn down $114million under
this credit facility which is the full amount currently available. The obligations under these
credit facilities are collateralized by a lien on substantially all of the Companys assets. Each of
these credit facilities contain certain customary covenants which require the Company to maintain
profitability beginning in the second fiscal quarter of 2007 and to meet certain tangible net
worth and debt service requirements. In addition, the Company must maintain $30million in
unrestricted cash at all times when borrowings are outstanding. In the event of default by the
Company with the covenants under these facilities, Mid-Peninsula Bank and the Export-Import Bank,
would be entitled to exercise their remedies, under these facilities, which include declaring all
obligations immediately due and payable and disposing of the collateral if obligations are not
paid. The Company has initiated discussions with the lenders with a view toward restructuring
these credit facilities to enable the Company to come into compliance with applicable covenants;
however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to satisfactory restructure the
credit facilities. The Company also intends to modify planned operations in order to increase
cash flows from operations, and raise additional capital through equity or debt financing in order
to enhance liquidity. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in
these efforts or that any additional capital raised through debt or equity financings will be
available on favorable terms or at all. If unsuccessful in these efforts, the Company may have
to suspend or cease operations. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability
to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 52 Table of Contents 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
Financial Statement Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Iridex Corporation and our
wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year always ends on the Saturday closest to December31. Fiscal 2006 ended on
December30, 2006; fiscal 2005 ended on December31, 2005 and fiscal 2004 ended on January1, 2005.   
Cash and Cash Equivalents For financial statement purposes, we consider all highly liquid debt instruments with
insignificant interest rate risk and an original maturity of three months or less when purchased
to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of cash deposits in money market funds
that are available for withdrawal without restriction.   
Available-for-Sale Securities All marketable securities as December31, 2005 are considered to be available-for-sale and
therefore are carried at fair value. Available-for-sale securities are classified as current assets
when they have original maturities of less than one year. Available-for-sale securities are
classified as non current assets when they have original maturities of more than one year.
Marketable securities include auction rate and floating rate securities. These securities are
structured as short-term, highly liquid investments that can be readily converted into cash every
30, 60 or 90days. However, since the stated or contractual maturities of these securities is
greater than 90days, these securities are classified as marketable securities and not cash
equivalents and included with current assets. Unrealized holding gains and losses on such
securities net of related taxes are reported as a component of comprehensive income in
shareholders equity until realized. Realized gains and losses on sales of all such securities are
reported in interest and other income and are computed using the specific identification cost
method.   
Sales Returns Allowance and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts In the process of preparing financial statements we make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amount of assets and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported
period. Specifically, we estimate future product returns related to current period product revenue.
We analyze historical returns, and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when
evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance and other allowances. Significant management
judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and
other allowances in any accounting period. Material differences may result in the amount and timing
of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different
estimates. The provision for sales returns amounted to $02million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and
2004. Similarly our management must make estimates regarding the uncollectability of our accounts
receivable. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-payment by customers to the extent
of amounts recorded on the balance sheet. As of December30, 2006, we had accounts receivable
totaling $61million, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $04million as compared with
total accounts receivable of $66million and $74million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts
of $06million and $05million, respectively, as of
December31, 2005 and January1, 2005. As
sales levels increase the level of accounts receivable would likely also increase. In the event
that customers were to delay their payments to us, the levels of accounts receivable would likely
also increase. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from
the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is
based on past payment history with the customer, analysis of the customers current financial
condition, the aging of the accounts receivable balance, customer concentration and other known
factors.   
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include on-hand inventory, sales
demo inventory and service loaner inventory. Cost is determined on a standard cost basis which
approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out FIFOmethod. Lower of cost or market is
evaluated by considering obsolescence, excessive levels of inventory, deterioration and other
factors. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value, if required, are
made for estimated excess, obsolescence or impaired inventory and are charged to cost of goods
sold. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand, product life cycle and
development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration and quality
issues. Revisions to these adjustments would be required if these factors differ from our
estimates. 53 Table of Contents   
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
which is generally three years. Amortization of leasehold improvements and property and equipment
is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the related assets,
typically three years. Our net property and equipment was $11million at the end of fiscal 2006
and at the end of fiscal 2005. We invested $05million in property and equipment in 2006 compared
with $03million in 2005. Capital expenditures in the last two years have been primarily for
engineering, manufacturing and office equipment.   
Revenue Recognition Our revenues arise from the sale of laser consoles, delivery devices, disposables and service
and support activities. Revenue from product sales in recognized upon receipt of a purchase order
and product shipment provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the
receivables is reasonably assured. Shipments are generally made with Free-On-Board FOBshipping
point terms, whereby title passes upon shipment from our dock. Any shipments with FOB receiving
point terms are recorded as revenue when the shipment arrives at the receiving point. Up-front
fees received in connection with product sales are deferred and recognized over the associated
product shipments. Revenue relating to extended warrant contracts is recognized on a straight line
basis over the period of the applicable warranty contract. We recognize repair service revenue
upon completion of the work. Cost is recognized as product sales revenue is recognized. The
Companys sales may include post-sales obligations for training or other deliverables. When these
obligations are fulfilled after product shipment, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with
the multiple element accounting guidance set forth in Emerging Issues Task Force No00-21,
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. When the Company has objective and reliable
evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements, it defers revenue attributable to the post-sale
obligations and recognizes such revenue when the obligation is fulfilled. Otherwise, the Company
defers all revenue related to the transaction until all elements are delivered.   
Deferred Revenue Revenue related to extended service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line
basis over the period of the applicable service period. Costs associated with these service
arrangements are recognized as incurred. A reconciliation of the changes in the Companys deferred
revenue balances for the years ended December30, 2006 and December31, 2005 is provided as follows

Warranty The Company accrues for estimated warranty costs upon shipment of products. Actual warranty
costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued. The Companys warranty policy is
applicable to products which are considered defective in their performance or fail to meet the
product specifications. Warranty costs are reflected in the statement of operations as a cost of
sales. A reconciliation of the changes in the Companys warranty liability for the years ended

Research and Development Research and development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred.   
Advertising Our policy is to expense advertising and promotion costs as they are incurred. Our
advertising and promotion expenses were approximately $424,000 in 2006, $288,000 in 2005 and
$218,000 in 2004 and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.   
Fair Value of Financial Instruments Carrying amounts of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short
maturities. The fair value for marketable debt and equity securities are based on quoted market
prices.   
Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for
the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and
liabilities. Under SFAS No109, the liability method is used in accounting for income taxes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial
reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates
and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. SFAS No109 also
requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not
that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate annually the
realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the
amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization
include our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be
implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.   
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation On January1, 2006 we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123 revised
2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R, which requires the measurement and recognition of
compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and directors, including employee
non-qualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock units and employee purchase rights
under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP Shares based on estimated fair values. SFAS 123R
supersedes previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 for periods beginning in fiscal year 2006. In March2005, the
Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No107 SAB 107
providing supplemental implementation guidance for SFAS 123R. We have applied the provisions of
SAB 107 in our adoption of SFAS 123R. 55 Table of Contents SFAS 123R requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of
grant using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately
expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated
statements of income. We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method which
requires the application of the accounting standard starting from January1, 2006, the first day of
our fiscal year 2006. Our consolidated financial statements, as of and for the year ended December
30, 2006, reflect the impact of SFAS 123R. In accordance with the modified prospective transition
method we used in adopting SFAS 123R, our results of operations prior to fiscal year 2006 have
not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS 123R. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we accounted for share-based awards to employees and
directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB 25 and FASB Interpretation FIN
No44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation an Interpretation of
APB Opinion No25. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for our fixed cost stock
option plans because stock-based awards were issued at fair market value on the date of grant Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the year ended December30, 2006, included
stock-based compensation expense for share-based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of
December31, 2005, based on the fair value on the grant date estimated in accordance with the pro
forma provisions of SFAS 123, and stock-based compensation expense for the share-based awards
granted subsequent to December31, 2005, based on the fair value on the grant date estimated in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 123R, we
changed our method of attributing the value of stock-based compensation expense from the
accelerated multiple-option method for the purposes of non-GAAP information under SFAS 123 to the
straight-line single option method. Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based awards
granted on or prior to December31, 2005 will continue to be recognized using the accelerated
multiple-option approach, while stock-based compensation expense for all share-based awards granted
subsequent to December30, 2005 will be recognized using the straight-line single option method.
SFAS 123R requires that we recognize expense for awards ultimately expected to vest; therefore we
are required to develop an estimate of the number of awards expected to cancel prior to vesting
forfeiture rate. The forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical pre-vest cancellation
experience and is applied to all share-based awards. SFAS 123R requires the forfeiture rate to be
estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
forfeitures differ from those estimates. Prior to fiscal year 2006, we accounted for forfeitures as
they actually occurred. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, we selected the Black-Scholes option pricing model as the most
appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value for stock options and ESPP Shares. The
Black-Scholes model requires the use of certain subjective and complex assumptions which determine
the fair value of share-based awards, including the options expected term and the price volatility
of the underlying stock. For restricted stock or restricted stock units, stock-based compensation
expense is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant.   
Concentration of Credit Risk and Other Risks and Uncertainties The Companys cash and cash equivalents are deposited in demand and money market accounts of
three financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided
on such deposits. Generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and therefore, bear minimal
risk. The Company markets its products to distributors and end-users throughout the world. Sales to
international distributors are generally made on open credit terms and letters of credit.
Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintains an allowance for
potential credit losses. Historically, the Company has not experienced any significant losses
related to individual customers or group of customers in any particular geographic area. For the
years ended December30, 2006, December31, 2005 and January1, 2005 no customer accounted for
greater than 10% of total sales. As of December30, 2006, December31, 2005, January1, 2005 no
customer accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable, net balance. The Companys products require approvals from the Food and Drug Administration and
international regulatory agencies prior to commercialized sales. The Companys future products may
not receive required approvals. If the Company were denied such approvals, or if such approvals
were delayed, it would have a materially adverse impact on the Companys business, results of
operations and financial condition. 56 Table of Contents   
Reliance on Certain Suppliers Certain components and services used by the Company to manufacture and develop its products
are presently available from only one or a limited number of suppliers or vendors. The loss of any
of these suppliers or vendors would potentially require a significant level of hardware and/or
software development efforts to incorporate the products or services into the Companys products.   
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent form other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, any
change in these estimates or their related assumptions could have an adverse effect on our
operating results.   
Net Income lossper Share Basic and diluted net income lossper share are computed by dividing net income lossfor
the year by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
The calculation of diluted net income lossper share excludes potential common stock if their
effect is anti-dilutive. Potential common stock consists of incremental common shares issuable upon
the exercise of stock options. See Note 10.   
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes an interpretation of SFAS 109 FIN 48. FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model
for recognizing, measuring, presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions
taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, including a decision whether to file or not to file
in a particular jurisdiction. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15,
2006. We will adopt FIN 48 in our year ended December29, 2007. We do not believe that the
adoption of the provisions of FIN 48 will materially impact our consolidated financial position and
results of operations. On September13, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements SAB 108, which provides interpretive
guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be
considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. The guidance became effective for our fiscal
year 2006. Our adoption of SAB 108 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position
and results of operations. In September2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No157, Fair
Value Measurements SFAS 157. SFAS 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value under
GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The changes to current practice
resulting from the application of SFAS 157 relate to the definition of fair value, the methods used
to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007 and interim periods within those
fiscal years. We do not believe that the adoption of the provisions of SFAS 157 will materially
impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations. 57 Table of Contents 3. Balance Sheet Detail Available-for-sale securities in thousands

4. Bank Borrowings At December31, 2005, the Company had a revolving line of credit agreement with a bank which provided for borrowings
of up to $40million at the banks prime rate 725% at December31, 2005. There were no
borrowings outstanding against this credit agreement at December31, 2005. This credit agreement
expired on October5, 2006. See footnote 11 regarding subsequent events. 58 Table of Contents 5. Commitments and Contingencies Lease Agreements The Company leases its operating facilities under a noncancelable operating lease. In
September2003, the Company entered into a lease amendment for our facility in Mountain View,
California. The original lease term of this facility, which ended in February2004, was amended and
extended until February2009. The lease was also amended to grant the Company an option to renew
this lease for an additional five year period beginning 2009 until 2014 at a base monthly rental
amount to be negotiated at the time of the renewal. Rent expense totaled $403,000 for each of the
fiscal years ended December30, 2006, December31, 2005 and January1, 2005. Future minimum lease payments under current operating leases at December30, 2006 are
summarized as follows in thousands

Related to the acquisition of the aesthetics business
of AMS in January 2007, we have agreed to purchase up to $90million worth of certain inventory
from AMS book value, following the termination of our
Product Supply Agreement with AMS no
later than October 2007. Principal payments under the term loans entered into in conjunction with the acquisition are
$98,000 per month over a term of 5years. The following annual operating lease commitments as of January17, 2007 were acquired as part of the acquisition of the French and UK subsidiaries of Laserscope.

License Agreements The Company is obligated to pay royalties equivalent to 5% and 75% of sales on certain
products under certain license agreements. Royalty expense was $93,000, $71,000 and $80,000 for the
years ended December30, 2006, December31, 2005 and January1, 2005, respectively. Contingencies Patent Litigation On October19, 2005, the Company filed a suit in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Missouri against Synergetics, USA, Inc. for infringement of a patent. The
Company later amended its complaint to assert infringement claims against Synergetics, Inc.;
Synergetics USA, Inc. was dismissed from the suit. The Company alleges that Synergetics infringes
the Companys patent by making and selling infringing products, including its Quick Disconnect
laser probes and its Quick Disconnect Laser Probe Adapter, and seeks injunctive relief, monetary
damages, treble damages, costs and attorneys fees. On July7, 2006, the Court issued a Claim Construction Ruling, interpreting 14 disputed
phrases within the Companys patent. The Court adopted the Companys position with respect to 13
of the 14 patent terms, and adopted a position between the Companys and Synergetics positions
with respect to the 14th term. Discovery closed on February15, 2007. Near the close of discovery, the Company filed five
summary judgment motions and Synergetics filed four. After the Courts rulings on these motions,
only four issues remain for trial. Those issues are: 1the jury will decide the amount of
damages caused by Synergetics infringement with their Quick Disconnect products, 2the jury will
decide whether Synergetics infringement was willful, 3the jury will decide the validity of the
IRIDEX patent on the issue of obviousness, and 4the Court will decide if IRIDEXs right to
recover damages for Synergetics infringement is limited by the equitable doctrines of laches and
estoppel. Trial is scheduled to begin on April16, 2007. The Company is confident that its patent
claims have merit, and if the parties do not reach a settlement, the Company intends to vigorously
pursue its claims to judgment. 59 Table of Contents The company is involved in two other pending suits with Synergetics. The first suit, entitled
Synergetics, Inc. v. Peregrine Surgical, Ltd., Innovatech Surgical, Inc., and IRIDEX Corporation,
is Case No06-CV-107 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
Synergetics filed suit against the Company on April25, 2006, by adding the Company as a defendant
to a then-existing lawsuit against the other two defendants. Synergetics alleges that the Company
infringes its patent and seeks injunctive relief, monetary damages, treble damages, costs and
attorneys fees. On June29, the Company filed its response to Synergetics pleading, denying
Synergetics claims and asserting counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment that it does not
infringe Synergetics patent. Synergetics responded to the Companys counterclaims on July24,
2006, denying them. On August10, 2006, the case was reassigned to District Judge Thomas Golden.
Judge Golden has set a status conference for May4, 2007. There have not yet been any significant
proceedings in this case. The second suit, entitled Synergetics, Inc. v. IRIDEX Corporation, is pending in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. Synergetics filed suit against the
Company on February21, 2007, alleging that the Companys assertion of patent infringement against
Synergetics constitutes a violation of the federal antitrust laws and also abuse of process in
Missouri. The Company has not yet been served with a copy of the summons and complaint, which was
filed under seal. The Company believes that Synergetics suit lacks merit in part because the
Court granted the Company judgment of infringement and denied Synergetics motion for judgment on
laches and intends to vigorously defend against Synergetics claims should Synergetics choose to
proceed with the suit. Management believes that liabilities resulting from such proceedings, or claims which are pending
or known to be threatened will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial
position or results of operations. The company may incur significant dedication of management
resources and legal costs in connection with this lawsuit. The Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in our ordinary course of
business. Pursuant to these arrangements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to
reimburse the indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party,
generally our business partners or customers, in connection with any trade secret, copyright,
patent or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to our
products. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual anytime after the
execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be
required to make under these agreements is not determinable. The Company has never incurred costs
to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, the
Company believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that
may require the Company: to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise
by reason of their status or service as directors or officers, other than liabilities arising from
willful misconduct of a culpable nature; to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any
proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified; and to make good faith determination
whether or not it is practicable for the Company to obtain directors and officers insurance. The
Company currently has directors and officers liability insurance. 6. Stockholders Equity Convertible Preferred Stock Our Articles of Incorporation authorize 2,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock.
Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. As of December30, 2006, we
had no preferred stock issued and outstanding. Treasury Stock In December1998, we instituted a stock repurchase program whereby up to 150,000 shares of our
Common Stock may be repurchased in the open market. We plan to utilize all of the reacquired shares
for reissuance in connection with our employee stock programs. In 2003, 2004 and 2005, no shares of
Common Stock were repurchased. A total of 103,000 shares of common stock had been repurchased as of
December31, 2005. The stock repurchase program was discontinued in 2005. 60 Table of Contents Stock Option Plans Amended and Restated 1989 Incentive Stock Plan The Amended and Restated 1989 Plan the 1989 Plan provided for the grant of options and
stock purchase rights to purchase shares of our Common Stock to employees and consultants. The
terms of the 1989 Plan, which expired in August1999, are substantially the same as the 1998 Plan
described below. 1998 Stock Plan The 1998 Stock Plan the 1998 Plan, as amended, provides for the granting to employees
including officers and employee directors of incentive stock options and for the granting to
employees including officers and employee directors and consultants of nonstatutory stock
options, stock purchase rights SPRs, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance
shares, performance units and stock appreciation rights. The exercise price of incentive stock
options and stock appreciation rights granted under the 1998 Plan must be at least equal to the
fair market value of the shares at the time of grant. With respect to any recipient who owns stock
possessing more than 10% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, the exercise price
of any option or SPR granted must be at least equal to 110% of the fair market value at the time of
grant. Options granted under the 1998 Plan are exercisable at such times and under such conditions
as determined by the Administrator; generally over a four year period. The maximum term of
incentive stock options granted to any recipient must not exceed ten years; provided, however, that
the maximum term of an incentive stock option granted to any recipient possessing more than 10% of
the voting power of our outstanding capital stock must not exceed five years. In the case of SPRs,
unless the Administrator determines otherwise, we have a repurchase option exercisable upon the
voluntary or involuntary termination of the purchasers employment with us for any reason
including death or disability. Such repurchase option lapses at a rate determined by the
Administrator. The purchase price for shares repurchased by us is the original price paid by the
purchaser. As of December30, 2006 and December31, 2005, no shares were subject to repurchase. The
form of consideration for exercising an option or stock purchase right, including the method of
payment, is determined by the Administrator. The 1998 Plan expires in June2008. In June of 2006,
this plan was amended to shorten the contractual life of all option grants made after June2006 to
a seven year term. 1995 Director Option Plan In October1995, we adopted the 1995 Director Option Plan the Director Plan, under which
members of the Board of Directors are granted options to purchase 11,250 shares upon the first to
occur of their appointment or the adoption of the Director Plan First Option and an option to
purchase 3,750 shares Subsequent Option on July 1 of each year thereafter provided that he or
she has served on the Board for at least the preceding six months. The options granted are at fair
market value on the date of grant. The First Option becomes exercisable as to one-twelfth 1/12 of
the shares subject to the First Option for each quarter over a three-year period. Each Subsequent
Option becomes exercisable as to one-fourth 1/4 of the shares subject to the Subsequent Option
for each quarter, commencing one quarter after the First Option and any previously granted
Subsequent Options have become fully exercisable. Options granted under the Director Plan had a
contractual term of ten years. In the event of our merger with or into another corporation,
resulting in a change of control, or the sale of substantially all of our assets, each Director
Plan options become exercisable in full and shall be exercisable for 30days after written notice
to the holder of the event causing the change in control. The Director Plan terminated in 2005. Stand-Alone Options In July2005, in connection with the employment of the Companys Chief Executive Officer, the
Companys Board of Directors granted a stand alone option, outside of the Companys existing stock
plans, to Barry Caldwell, its Chief Executive Officer. The option entitles Mr.Caldwell to purchase
up to 234,104 61 Table of Contents shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $607 per share. In
conjunction with the employment of the Companys Chief Executive Officer, in consideration of
services performed under a recruiting contract, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 25,000
shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $607 per share. The warrant is
exercisable at any time and expires on July5, 2008. The fair value of the warrants of $87,000 was
recorded as an expense for the twelve month period ended December31, 2005. The fair value of the
warrant was calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions:
dividend yield 0percent, contractual life of 3years, risk free rates of 404percent and
volatility of 83percent. At December30, 2006, this option remains outstanding. In March2006, in connection with the employment of the Companys Vice President of Product
Innovation, the Companys Board of Directors granted a stand alone option, outside of the Companys
existing stock plans, to Deborah Tomasco, the Companys Vice President of Product Innovation. The
option entitles Ms.Tomasco to purchase up to 50,000 shares of the Companys common stock at
an exercise price of $826 per share. 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Our 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan was adopted by the Board of
Directors in June2005. The total number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the
Purchase Plan at December30, 2006 was 12,948. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees
including officers to purchase Common Stock through payroll deductions, which may not exceed 10%
of an employees compensation. No employee may purchase more than $25,000 worth of stock in any
calendar year or more than 2,000 shares of Common Stock in any twelve-month period. The price of
shares purchased under the Purchase Plan is 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Common
Stock at the beginning of the offering period or the end of the offering period. Information with respect to activity under these option plans are set forth below in
thousands except share and per share data

At December31, 2005 and January1, 2005 options to purchase 2,154,003 and 1,823,392 shares of
common stock were exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of $631 and $536,
respectively. As of December30, 2006, the aggregate intrinsic value of fully vested and exercisable options
was $44million. Adoption of SFAS 123R The Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method, which requires the
application of the accounting standard as of January1, 2006, the first day of the Companys fiscal
year. The Companys financial statements for the year ended December30, 2006 reflect the impact
of SFAS 123R. In accordance with the modified prospective method, the Companys financial
statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include the impact of
SFAS 123R. Stock-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS 123R for the twelve months
ended December30, 2006 was $18million, which consisted of stock-based compensation expense
related to stock options and employee stock purchases. 63 Table of Contents We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
formula. In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 123R on January1, 2006, the Company changed
its method of attributing the value of stock-based compensation from the accelerated
multiple-option approach to the straight-line single option method for options granted following
the adoption of SFAS 123R. The determination of fair value of all options granted by the Company is computed based on the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions

Option-pricing models require the input of various subjective assumptions, including the
options expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price
volatility is based on analysis of the Companys stock price history over a period commensurate
with the expected term of the options, trading volume of the Companys stock, look-back
volatilities and Company specific events that affected volatility in a prior period. The expected
term of options granted is based on an analysis of historical exercise and post-vesting employment
termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in
effect at the time of grant. No dividend yield is included as the Company has not issued any
dividends and does not anticipate issuing any dividends in the future. The following table shows stock-based compensation expense included in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations for 2006 in thousands

The modified prospective transition method of SFAS 123R requires the presentation of
pro-forma information for periods presented prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R regarding net
income lossand net income lossper share as if the Company had accounted for the Companys
stock options under the fair value method of SFAS 123. If compensation expense had been determined
based upon the fair value at grant date for employee compensation arrangements, consistent with the
methodology prescribed under SFAS 123, the Companys pro forma net income and net income per common
share under SFAS 123 for the twelve months ended December31, 2005 and January1, 2005 would have
been as follows in thousands except per share data. 64 Table of Contents

During the quarter ending
December30, 2006, as a result of the losses incurred in 2006 and uncertainty regarding the ability
to project future profitable results, management determined it was no longer more likely than
not that the company would realize the deferred tax assets recorded. As such, the company recorded
a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. The amount of this valuation allowance was
$2,888,000. The company will continue to evaluate its ability to utilize the deferred tax assets
on a quarterly basis. As of December30, 2006, the company had Federal and State net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $1,838,000 and $1,950,00 respectively. The federal losses will expire in 2027 and the
state losses will begin to expire in 2017. Of the above NOLs, $1,451,000 and $1,095,000
respectively, relate to windfall stock option deductions which when realized will be credited to
equity. As of December30, 2006, the Company had Federal and State research credit carryforwards of
approximately $704,000 and $731,000 available to offset future liabilities. The Federal credits
will begin expiring in 2020 if not used. The state research credits do not expire. The above net operating losses and RD credits are subject to IRC sections 382 383. In the event
of a change in ownership as defined by these code sections, the usage of the above mentioned NOLs
and credits may be limited. 9. Major Customers and Business Segments The Company operates in two reportable segments: the ophthalmology medical device segment and
the dermatology medical device segment. In both segments, the Company develops, manufactures and
markets medical devices. Our revenues arise from the sale of consoles, delivery devices,
disposables and service and support activities. In the years ended December30, 2006, December31, 2005 and January1, 2005, no customer
individually accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. 67 Table of Contents Revenue information shown in thousands by geographic region is as follows

In 2006 and 2004 there were 2,131,570 and 463,588 outstanding options to purchase shares at a
weighted average exercise price of $553 and $865 per share, respectively, that were not included
in the computation of diluted net loss per common share because their effect was antidilutive.
These options could dilute earnings per share in future periods. In 2005, there were 454,918
options outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of $848 that were not included in the
computation of diluted net income lossper common share since the exercise price of the options
exceeded the market price of the common stock. 11. Subsequent Events Credit Facility On January16, 2007, the Company entered into ia Business Loan and Security Agreement the
Business Loan Agreement with Mid-Peninsula Bank, part of Greater Bay Bank N.A. Lender, ii
an Export-Import Bank Loan and Security Agreement the Exim Agreement with Lender, and iiia

up to $3million principal amount the Exim Sublimit will be
guaranteed by Exim Bank. The Companys obligations under the Term Loans and the Revolving Loans including the Exim
Sublimit are secured by a lien on substantially all of the Companys assets. Interest on the Term Loan and the
Revolving Loans including the Exim Sublimit
is the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, minus 05%, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances
including adjustments to the prime rate, late payment or the
occurrence of an event of default. Payments of principal outstanding
under the Term Loan are due in sixty monthly installments beginning
February28, 2007 and ending February28, 2012. All
outstanding amounts under the Revolving Loans are payable in full on
January31, 2009. If at any the amount outstanding under the
Revolving Loans exceeds the Borrowing Base, the Company will be
required to pay the difference between the outstanding amount and the
Borrowing Base. The Company may prepay all amounts outstanding under
the Term Loan and Revolving Loans without penalty. These facilities contain
certain financial and other
covenants, including the requirement for Iridex to maintain profitability on a quarterly basis. Tangible net worth

include, but are not limited to, covenants limiting or restricting the Companys ability to incur indebtedness,
incur liens, enter into mergers or consolidations,
dispose of assets, make investments, pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates, or prepay certain
indebtedness. In the event of noncompliance by the Company with the covenants under these facilities, the
Mid-Peninsula Bank and Export-Import Bank, would be
entitled to exercise their remedies, under these facilities, which include declaring all obligations immediately
due and payable and disposing of the collateral if obligations were not paid. The Company anticipates being in
non-compliance with the covenants as of March30, 2007.

private limited company, and Laserscope France, S.A., a French socit anonyme together, the Subsidiaries, after segregation of the assets and the liabilities of each entity which were not part of the Aesthetics Business. In exchange for such net assets and equity
interests in the Subsidiaries, the Company assumed certain liabilities specified in the Asset Purchase Agreement and paid Laserscope $28million at closing, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, consisting of $26million in immediately available funds and 213,435
shares of the Companys common stock, based upon the average closing price of the Companys common stock for a 20-day period immediately preceding the closing date of the transaction, which was calculated to be $937. The Company will also pay Laserscope up to an additional $90million as
determined by the book value of certain inventory following termination of a manufacturing transition period of approximately six to nine months. 70 Table of Contents Stand-Alone Options On February13, 2007, in connection with the employment of the Companys Chief Financial

Item5. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures a Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Our management evaluated, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer CEOand its
Chief Financial Officer CFO, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in Rule13A-15e and Rule15d-15e of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 the 34 Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed with the objective of ensuring that i
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the 34 Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and ii
information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Internal control procedures,
which are designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that our transactions are
properly authorized, our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use and its
transactions are properly recorded and reported, are intended to permit the preparation of our
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. To the extent
that elements of our internal controls over financial reporting are included within our disclosure
controls and procedures, they are included in the scope of our quarterly controls evaluation. Based on that evaluation, and as a result of the material weakness in our internal controls
over financial reporting discussed below, the CEO and CFO concluded that as of the end of the
period covered by this report, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. A material weakness
is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, that
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management determined that the following
control deficiencies constitute a material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting at December30, 2006. In connection with the annual audit of our financial statements as of December30, 2006 and
December31, 2005, our independent registered public accounting firm communicated to our management
and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors that they had identified a control deficiency
that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that they
considered to be a material weakness, because the control deficiency resulted in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement could occur in our annual financial statements and not be
prevented or detected. Specifically, the material weakness identified by our independent
accountants relates to a failure to maintain adequate period-end review procedures to ensure the
completeness and accuracy of certain journal entries impacting general ledger accounts. As a
result, incorrect entries were recorded to the financial statements which were not identified and
corrected by management in a timely manner. Plan for remediation of material weaknesses To address the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified
above, management has designed a remediation plan which will supplement the existing controls of
the Company. The remediation plan addresses the following corrective actions 72 Table of Contents   
implementation of additional controls over the preparation and review of key spreadsheets   
implementation of automated general ledger reports to replace existing key spreadsheets where possible   
implementation of additional review procedures; and   
enhancement of the current capabilities of the finance function. Even if we are to successfully remediate each of the material weaknesses described above,
because of inherent limitations, our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect
misstatements or material omissions. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. bChanges in internal control over financial reporting As disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September30, 2006, in
August2006, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors engaged outside counsel and initiated an
independent review of our revenue recognition practices. This review was initiated in response to
an allegation made by a former employee. In the course of this review, errors in revenue
recognition were identified and
management, with the participation of the CEO and CFO, determined the Company did not maintain
effective controls over the accounting for revenue. In the quarter ended December30, 2006 the Company implemented the following changes to internal
control related to our revenue recognition practices   
reassignment of responsibilities for oversight of the sales function and
responsibilities for internal control over sales transactions   
provision of additional training on a recurring basis for all domestic sales personnel
on revenue recognition policies and procedures   
establishment of annual formal training for our customer service group on revenue
recognition policies and procedures   
establishment of a checklist for use by our customer service group in processing revenue
transactions to verify proper recognition and establishment of a policy by which this
checklist is signed off by the preparer and at least one reviewer   
establishment of internal audit procedures over all domestic laser sale transactions; and   
formalization over our sales returns process to include more thorough documentation,
review and approval for all returns. We believe that the implementation of these corrective actions have mitigated the material
weaknesses that were identified as of September30, 2006 related to our revenue recognition
practices. Subsequent to December30, 2006 the Company enhanced the current capabilities of the Companys
finance function by adding a new Chief Financial Officer. 73 Table of Contents No other change has occurred in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in
Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f of the 34 Act during the quarter ended December30, 2006, that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over
financial reporting. As discussed in aabove, management has designed a plan for remediation and
is implementing changes in our internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material
weaknesses identified above.
