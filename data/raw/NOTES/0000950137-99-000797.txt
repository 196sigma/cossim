Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future
tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and
the tax bases of other assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities
is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
STOCK OPTION PLANS
The Company accounts for its stock options plans in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No. 123, which allows entities to continue
to apply the provisions of APB opinion No. 25 and provide pro forma net
income and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for employee stock
option grants made in 1995 and future years as if the fair-valued based
method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied.
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
Florsheim complies with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions
SFAS No. 106. SFAS No. 106 requires the cost of these benefits to be
recognized in the financial statements over an employee service period
with the company.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The accounts of the foreign subsidiaries have been translated from their
functional currency to the U.S. dollar. Such translation adjustments are
not included in income, but are accumulated directly in a separate
component of stockholders' equity.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Standards No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income SFAS No. 130. This statement establishes standards
for reporting and display of comprehensive income, which includes foreign
currency translation adjustments. SFAS No. 130 requires that an enterprise
classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a financial
statement for the period on which they are recognized. Florsheim has chosen
to disclose other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Accumulated other comprehensive income at December 28, 1996,
January 3, 1998 and January 2, 1999 is comprised of only foreign currency
translation adjustments. Prior years have been restated to conform to the
SFAS No. 130 requirements.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings
excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common
stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted earnings reflects the potential dilution that could
occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised
or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock
that then shared in the earnings of the equity. Basic and diluted earnings
per share do not include securities in instances where they would be
antidilutive.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the weighted average
shares outstanding used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per
share

There are no adjustments to earnings before extraordinary item,
extraordinary item, or net earnings.
AMORTIZATION OF PREPAID EXPENSES
Certain expenses related to obtaining financing have been capitalized and
are being amortized over the life of the financing to which they relate.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company reviews long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company
considers stores with operating losses in a consecutive two year period as
potentially impaired. A review is conducted on a store by store basis,
grouped by year of lease expiration, comparing future undiscounted net cash
flows to the carrying value of fixtures and leasehold improvements to test
for impairment. Impairment, when present, is calculated as the difference
between the asset carrying value and the future discounted net cash
flowsfair value.
Pursuant to its review of the retail store operations, the Company has
provided valuation reserves against the carrying value of the long lived
assets of certain retail stores in selling, general and administrative
expenses of $500 in fiscal 1996, $400 in fiscal 1997 and $256 in fiscal
1998.
NON-CASH TRANSACTIONS
During fiscal 1997 and 1998, the Company entered into non-cash transactions
with a third party whereby Florsheim would exchange excess inventory for
advertising and media credits. At January 2, 1999, barter credits of $2,624
are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets at a cost that is
consistent with the value of the inventory surrendered. Any differences
between cost and the actual value of the credits is recognized
proportionally as the credits are utilized.
ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED/OBTAINED FOR 
INTERNAL USE
During 1998, the company adopted the provisions of Statement of Position
98-1 which provides guidance on the capitalization of certain internal
costs as they relate to implementing software being developed or
implemented for internal use. At January 2, 1999, Florsheim capitalized
approximately $10 million of internal costs in association with its SAP
software implementation.
3   STORE CLOSINGS
In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company recognized restructuring charges
of $3,261 related to the closing of 46 retail locations in 1998, and the
planned closings of 30 locations in 1999. These charges were taken in
connection with the Company plan to aggressively shut down
non-contributing locations and to liquidate the inventory in place. The
plan for the 1999 stores closings involves a going-out-of-business
pricing policy and merchandise presentation in a specified period preceding
the shut down GOB.
The following table summarizes the costs reflected in the 1998 Consolidated
Statement of Operations. $2,132 is reflected as cost associated with store
closings which is principally related to the liquidation of inventory and
$1,129 as non-recurring selling, general, and administrative expenses,
which consist of fixed asset write downs and incremental operating
expenses. A summary of the charges is as follows                    24

believes sufficient taxable income will be generated from future operations
to realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets. At January 2, 1999, the
Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax
purposes through 2012, and foreign tax credit carryforwards through 2002.
9   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Florsheim maintains non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering
the majority of its employees and retirees. Annual cost for
company-sponsored defined benefit plans is determined using the projected
unit credit actuarial method. Prior service cost is amortized on a
straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees
expected to receive benefits. It is Florsheim practice to fund pension
costs to the extent that such costs are tax deductible and in accordance
with ERISA. The assets of the various plans include corporate equities,
government securities, corporate debt securities and insurance contracts.
In addition to pension and other supplemental benefits, certain retired
employees are currently provided with specified health care and life
insurance benefits. Eligibility requirements for such benefits generally
state that benefits are available to employees who retire after a certain
age with specified years of service if they agree to contribute a portion
of the cost. Florsheim has reserved the right to modify or terminate these
benefits. Health care and life insurance benefits are provided to both
retired and active employees through third-party administrators and
insurance companies.                    30

For postretirement benefit plans, Florsheim assumed 70% annual rate of
increase in the per capita costs of covered health care benefits the
health care cost trend rate for 1999, and 60% in 2000 and thereafter. A
one percent increase in the health care cost trend rate would result in an
increase in Florsheim accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
January 2, 1999 by $22 and the interest and services cost by $140 for the
year then ended. A decrease of 1% would result in decreases of $20 and
$131, respectively.
Florsheim has Supplemental Pension Plans in place with an accumulated
obligation in excess of plan assets, which are reflected in the prepaid
pension cost above on a net basis. In the Consolidated Balance Sheet they
are reported in the Other Liabilities section. These plans cover certain
executives of the Company and employees covered under pre-ERISA
regulations. For the years ended January 3, 1998 and January 2, 1999, the
Projected Benefit Obligation is $1,239 and $1,362; the Accumulated Benefit
Obligation is $1,154 and $1,205, there are no assets in the plan.
The Company maintains a 401K account that allows employees to contribute
a portion of their pre-tax and/or after tax income in accordance with
specified guidelines. Florsheim matches a percentage of employee
contributions up to certain limits. Florsheim participated during fiscal
years 1996 through 1998. Florsheim cost for this plan for fiscal 1996,
1997, and 1998 was $164, $143, and $109 respectively.
10  LEASE COMMITMENTS
Substantially all of Florsheim retail outlets and certain other real
properties and equipment are operated under lease agreements expiring at
various dates through the year 2016. Leases covering retail outlets and
equipment generally require, in addition to stated minimums, contingent
rentals based on retail sales and equipment usage. Certain of the leases
provide for renewal for various periods at stipulated rates. Rental
expenses under operating leases were as follows                    32

15 BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Effective for 1998 reporting the company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information SFAS No. 131.
SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for reporting information about
operating segments, products and services, geographic areas and major
customers. The presentation of segments information reflects the manner in
which management organizes segments for making operating decisions and
assessing performance. Prior year amounts have been restated to conform to
the current presentation format. Under the provisions of the new standard,
Florsheim has three current reportable segments: U.S. Wholesale, U.S.
Retail and International. In 1996, the Company also had Hytest as a
reportable segment. U. S. Wholesale distributes footwear to large national
retailers, department stores, independent shoe stores and to Company
operated specialty and outlet stores. U.S. Wholesale also includes certain
corporate expenses and assets which are not charged to other reportable
segments. U. S. Retail consists of specialty retail shoe shops and outlet
stores. International consists of wholesale and retail operations in
Australia, Canada, the Pacific Rim, Europe and export business.
The Company reportable segments are organized according to the markets,
which they serve. The segment disclosures are on a basis consistent with
internal management reporting. Sales of product from U.S. Wholesale to U.S.
Retail and International include a standard mark-up, which is eliminated
in consolidation. The cost of certain corporate functions are charged to
the segments, however no allocation of debt or income taxes is made to the
individual segments. The accounting policies of the segments are the same
as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.                    34

17  YEAR 2000
The Year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs being written using
two digits rather than four to define the applicable year. In other words,
date-sensitive software may recognize a date using 00 as the year 1900
rather than the year 2000. This could result in system failures or
miscalculations causing disruptions of operations, including, among others,
a temporary inability to process transactions, send invoices, or engage in
similar normal business activities. Florsheim has initiated a worldwide
program to prepare the Company information systems and applications for
the Year 2000 issue, as well as a review of all material aspects of the
business that could be affected thereby. Included in this process are
assessments of the preparedness of suppliers, service providers and
customers. In addition, the Company is investing in technology to
significantly improve its management information systems, costing
approximately $12,900, which is being capitalized during 1997, 1998 and
1999. The Year 2000 issue is being addressed within this upgrade. Total
costs to date are approximately $7,900. The Company believes that the Year
2000 issue will not pose significant operational problems for its internal
computer systems.
18  SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION
