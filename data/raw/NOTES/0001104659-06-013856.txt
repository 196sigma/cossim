32 Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of Simpson Manufacturing Co.,Inc. We have completed integrated audits of Simpson
Manufacturing Co.,Inc.s 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements
and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005,
and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below. Consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Simpson Manufacturing Co.,Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedulelisted in the
accompanying index presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction
with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement scheduleare the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedulebased on our audits.
We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and performthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Internal control
over financial reporting Also, in our
opinion, managements assessment, included in Managements Report on Internal
Controls over Financial Reporting, appearing under Item 9A, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2005 based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
issued by the COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment andon
the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and performthe
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of
internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinions. A companys internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. 33 Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting maynot prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls maybecome inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures maydeteriorate.

and Subsidiaries
Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Operations
and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Except where otherwise
indicated, amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the notes
thereto are in thousands, except per share amounts. Nature of
Operations Simpson
Manufacturing Co.,Inc., through its subsidiaries Simpson Strong-Tie
Company Inc. Simpson Strong-Tie and Simpson Dura-Vent Company,Inc.
and its other subsidiaries collectively, the Company, designs, engineers
and manufactures wood-to-wood, wood-to-concrete and wood-to-masonry connectors, screw fastening systems and collated screws,
pre-fabricated shearwalls and
venting systems for gas and wood burning and alternative fuel appliances. The
Company markets its products to the residential construction, light industrial
and commercial construction, remodeling and do-it-yourself markets. Simpson
Strong-Tie also offers a line of adhesives, mechanical anchors and powder
actuated tools for concrete, masonry and steel. The Company operates
exclusively in the building products industry. The Companys products are sold
primarily throughout North America and Europe. Revenues have some geographic
market concentration on the west coast of the United States. A portion of the
Companys business is therefore dependent on economic activity within this
region and market. Principles of
Consolidation The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Simpson Manufacturing Co.,Inc.
and its subsidiaries. Investments in less than 50% owned affiliates are
generally accounted for using either cost or the equity method. The Company
consolidates all variable interest entities VIEs where it is the primary
beneficiary. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete, net of applicable provision for discounts, returns and incentives, whether actual or estimated based on the Companys experience. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the sales agreement or purchase order, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer, collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. The Companys general shipping terms are F.O.B. shipping point, where title is transferred and revenue is recognized when the products are shipped to customers. When the Company sells F.O.B. destination point, title is transferred and the Company recognizes revenue on delivery or customer acceptance, depending on terms of the sales agreement. Service sales, representing aftermarket repair and maintenance and engineering activities, though significantly less than 1
% of net sales and not material to the consolidated financial statements, are recognized as the services are completed. If the actual costs of sales returns, incentives, and discounts were to significantly exceed the recorded estimated allowance, the Companys sales would be adversely affected. Cash
Equivalents The Company considers all
highly liquid investments with an original or remaining maturity of three
months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments The Companys investments
in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale investments and are
recorded at fair value. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific
identification method. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a separate
component of stockholders equity. The Company also has a minority investment
in a privately 39 held company. These kinds
of investments are carried either at cost or by the equity method of
accounting, depending on the Companys ownership interest and its ability to
influence the operating or financial decisions of the investee, and are
classified as long-term investments. The Company periodically
reviews its investments for impairment. If the carrying value of an investment
exceeds its fair value and the decline in fair value is determined to be
other-than-temporary, the Company writes down the value of the investment to
its fair value. The Company generally believes an other-than-temporary decline
occurs when the fair value of an investment is below the carrying value for two
consecutive quarters. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company assesses the
collectibility of specific customer accounts that would be considered doubtful
based upon the customers financial condition, payment history, credit rating
and other factors that the Company considers relevant, or accounts that the
Company assigns for collection. The Company reserves for the portion of those
outstanding balances that the Company believes it is not likely to collect.
Specifically, the Company reserves accounts receivable balances that are over
90 days outstanding. The Company also reserves 100% of the amount that it deems
potentially uncollectible due to a customers bankruptcy or deteriorating
financial condition. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were
to deteriorate, resulting in inability to make payments, additional allowances maybe
required. Inventory
Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value market. Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, as follows:Raw materials and purchased finished goods for resale - principally valued at cost determined on a weighted average basis.In-process products and finished goods cost of direct materials and labor plus attributable overhead based on a normal level of activity.The Company applies net realizable value and obsolescence to the gross value of the inventory. The Company estimates net realizable value based on estimated selling price less further costs to completion and disposal. The Company provides for slow moving product by comparing inventories on hand to future projected demand. Obsolete inventory is on-hand supply of a product in excess of two years sales of that product or a supply of that product that the Company believes is no longer marketable. The Company revalues obsolete inventory as having no net realizable value. The Company has consistently applied this methodology. The Company believes that this approach is prudent and makes suitable provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory. Sales Incentive and Advertising Allowances The Company records
estimated reductions to revenues for sales incentives, primarily rebates for
volume discounts, and allowances for co-operative advertising. Allowances for Sales Discounts The Company records
estimated reductions to revenues for discounts taken on early payment of
invoices by its customers. Warranties The Company provides
product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for estimated future
warranty costs, none of which has been material to the consolidated financial
statements, in the period in which the sale is recorded. Property,
Plant and Equipment Property, plant and
equipment are carried at cost. Major renewals and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance
and repairs are expensed on a current basis. When assets are sold or retired,
their costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the
resulting gains or losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of
operations. 40 Depreciation
and Amortization Depreciation of property,
plant and equipment is provided for using accelerated methods over the
following estimated useful lives 
Machinery and equipment
3 to 10 years
Buildings and site improvements
20 to 45 years
Leasehold improvements
are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the expected
life or the remaining term of the lease. Amortization of intangible assets with
finite useful lives is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Product
Research and Development Costs Product research and
development costs, which are included in cost of sales and were charged against
income as incurred, were $49 million, $45 million and $41 million in 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively. The types of costs included as Product Research and
Development expenses are typically related to salaries and benefits and
supplies. The Company amortizes acquired patents over their remaining lives and
performs periodic reviews for impairment. The cost of internally developed
patents are expensed as incurred. Tooling
Costs Tool and die costs are
included in product costs in the year incurred. Shipping
and Handling Costs The Companys general
shipping terms are F.O.B. shipping point. Shipping and handling costs are
included in product costs in the year incurred. Advertising
Costs Advertising costs are
included in selling expenses, are expensed when the advertising occurs, and
were $101 million, $91 million and $79 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Income
Taxes Income taxes are
calculated using an asset and liability approach. The provision for income
taxes includes federal, state and foreign taxes currently payable and deferred
taxes, due to temporary differences between the financial statement and tax
bases of assets and liabilities. In addition, future tax benefits are
recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than
not. Foreign
Currency Translation The
local currency is the functional currency of the Companys operations in Europe
and Canada. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
translated using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and
expenses are translated using average exchange rates prevailing during the
year. The translation adjustment resulting from this process is shown
separately as a component of stockholders equity. Foreign currency transaction
gains or losses are included in general and administrative expenses and have
not been significant in any of the years presented. Common Stock Subject
to the rights of holders of any preferred stock that maybe issued in the
future, holders of common stock are entitled to receive such dividends, if any,
as maybe declared from time to time by the Board of Directors the Board
out of legally available funds, and in the event of liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up of the Company, to share ratably in all assets available for
distribution. The holders of common stock have no preemptive or conversion
rights. Subject to the rights of any preferred stock that maybe issued in
the future, the holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on
any matter submitted to a vote of the stockholders, except that, subject to
compliance with pre-meeting notice and other conditions pursuant to the Companys
Bylaws, stockholders maycumulate their votes in an election of directors,
and each stockholder maygive one candidate a number of votes equal to the
number of directors to be elected multiplied by the number of shares held by
such stockholder or maydistribute such stockholders votes on the same
principle among as many candidates as such stockholder thinks fit. There are no
redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. 41 In 1999, the Company declared a dividend distribution of one Right to
purchase SeriesA Participating preferred stock per share of common stock.
The Rights will be exercisable, unless redeemed earlier by the Company, if a
person or group acquires, or obtains the right to acquire, 15% or more of the
outstanding shares of common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer that
would result in it acquiring 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock,
either event occurring without the prior consent of the Company. The amount of SeriesA
Participating preferred stock that the holder of a Right is entitled to receive
and the purchase price payable on exercise of a Right are both subject to
adjustment. Any person or group that acquires 15% or more of the outstanding
shares of common stock without the prior consent of the Company would not be
entitled to this purchase. Any stockholder who holds 25% or more of the Companys
common stock on the date of the Rights distribution would not be treated as
having acquired 15% or more of the outstanding shares unless such stockholders
ownership is increased to more than 40% of the outstanding shares. The Rights will expire on July29, 2009, or they maybe
redeemed by the Company at onecent per Right prior to that date. The
Rights do not have voting or dividend rights and, until they become
exercisable, have no dilutive effect on the earnings of the Company. One
million shares of the Companys preferred stock have been designated SeriesA
Participating preferred stock and reserved for issuance on exercise of the
Rights. No event during 2005 made the Rights exercisable. Existing loan agreements
require the Company to maintain tangible net worth of $2500 million plus 50%
of net profit after taxes for each fiscal year. This requirement maylimit
the amount that the Company maypay out as dividends on the common stock.
As of December31, 2005, the Company had $2068 million available for the
payment of dividends under these loan agreements. In November2005,
the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million
of the Companys common stock. The authorization will remain in effect through
the end of 2006. This replaces the $500 million repurchase authorization from December2004. Preferred Stock The Board has the
authority to issue the authorized and unissued preferred stock in one or more serieswith
such designations, rights and preferences as maybe determined from time
to time by the Board. Accordingly, the Board is empowered, without stockholder
approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion,
voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other
rights of the holders of the Companys common stock. Net
Income per Common Share Basic
net income per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. Potentially dilutive shares, using the treasury
stock method, are included in the diluted per-share calculations for all
periods when the effect of their inclusion is dilutive. The

outstanding stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted
earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income,
which is included in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity, is
defined as net income plus other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive
income includes changes in foreign currency translation adjustments recorded
directly into stockholders equity and changes in net unrealized gains on available-for-sale
investments. The

Concentration
of Credit Risk Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist of cash in banks, short-term investments in U.S. Treasury
securities, money market instruments and other fixed income instruments and
trade accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash in demand deposit and
money market accounts held primarily by four banks. Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation The Company maintains two
stock option plans under which the Company maygrant incentive stock
options and non-qualified stock options to employees, consultants and
non-employee directors. Non-qualified stock options have been granted with
exercise prices at or above the fair market value on the date of grant. Options
vest and expire according to terms established from time to time pursuant to
the option plans by the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors. In December2002,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure, which amends SFAS No123. SFAS
No148 requires more prominent and frequent disclosures about the effects
of stock-based compensation. As of January1, 2003, the Company adopted
SFAS No123 and SFAS No148 and has used the prospective method of
applying SFAS No123 for the transition. For stock options granted prior
to January1, 2003, the Company will continue to account for stock-based
compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations. Accordingly, because the grant price
equaled or exceeded the market price on the date of grant for options issued by
the Company, no compensation expense has been recognized for stock options
granted prior to January1, 2003. 43 Had compensation cost for
the Companys stock options been recognized based on the estimated fair value
on the grant date under the fair value methodology prescribed by SFAS No123
see Note 13, as amended by SFAS No148, the Companys net income and
earnings per share would have been as follows

Under
the 1994 Stock Option Plan, no more than 16 million shares of common stock maybe
sold including shares already sold pursuant to all options granted under the
Option Plan. Under the 1995 Independent Director Stock Option Plan, no more
than 320 thousand shares of common stock maybe sold including shares
already sold pursuant to all options granted under the Independent Director
Plan. Options granted under either plan typically vest evenly over four years
and have seven-year terms. For
purposes of the fair value analysis, the fair value of each option granted was
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following assumptions for 2002: risk-free interest rate of 401 no
dividend yield; expected lives of 62 years; and volatility of 292%. The
weighted average fair value per share of options granted for 2002 was $617. The
assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated
and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and the Companys
experience. With the adoption
of SFAS Statement No123 and SFAS Statement No148, the expense for
the estimated fair value of the stock options awarded is recorded over the
vesting period of each option commencing in the year in which the option is
granted rather than during the year in which the option is earned as in the pro
forma computation. Accordingly, the amount expensed differs from the pro forma
expense disclosure under SFAS Statement No123. In December2004,
the FASB issued SFAS No123R, Share Based Payment Revised 2004,
which revised SFAS No123 to require companies to record compensation
cost for stock-based employee compensation plans based on the fair value of
options granted. While the Company currently accounts for stock options on a fair-value
basis, additional changes will be required, such as those affecting cash flow
presentation whereby excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options
will be presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing
activity rather than an operating activity, as currently presented. SFAS No123R
will be effective in the first quarter of 2006. The Company will use the
modified prospective application approach as the transition method. Management
does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No123R will have a material
effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or total cash
flows. Under the 1994 Stock Option plan, the Company allows for full vesting
on retirement if the employee becomes retirement eligible on reaching age
sixty. Currently, stock-based employee compensation expense is recorded over
the nominal vesting period and if a retirement eligible employee retires before
the end of the vesting period, the Company records an expense for any
unrecognized compensation cost at the date of retirement the nominal vesting
period approach. The nominal vesting period is four years of service
subsequent to the grant date. The non-substantive vesting period approach
specifies that awards, in substance, become vested when the employees
retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing service. Under this
approach, the unrecorded compensation cost is expensed when that condition is
met even if the employee continues providing service to the Company. This would
be the case for existing grants when an employee becomes retirement eligible as
well as when a retirement eligible employee is granted an award. On adoption of
SFAS No123R in the first quarter of 2006, the 44 Company will adopt the non-substantive vesting period approach for new
grants that have retirement eligibility provisions. The after-tax effect on net
income of applying the nominal vesting period approach versus the
non-substantive vesting period approach is as follows

Adoption
of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards In July2001, the FASB issued SFAS Statement No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which requires that goodwill and
certain other intangible assets having indefinite lives no longer be amortized against
earnings, but instead be subject to periodic testing for impairment. Intangible
assets determined to have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their
useful lives. SFAS Statement No142 was effective for the Companys
fiscal year that began January1, 2002. The Company reviews for
impairment its indefinite lived intangible assets annually, in the fourth
quarter of each year, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying value of an asset maynot be recoverable in accordance with
SFAS No142. SFAS No142 requires that management performa
two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, management compares the
fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The fair value
calculation uses a discounted cash flow model approach over a fifteen-year
period. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit
exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, a second step of the impairment
test must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units
goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its
implied fair value, an impairment charge equal to the difference between the
implied fair value of the goodwill and the carrying cost would be reported. Determining the fair
value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived purchased intangible asset is
a judgment involving significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and
assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to
calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, and future
economic and market conditions. The Company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions
that management believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and
inherently uncertain. Actual future results maydiffer from those
estimates. The Companys annual goodwill impairment analysis did not result in
an impairment charge in 2005 or 2004. The changes in the
carrying amount of goodwill not subject to amortization as of December31,
2004 and 2005, are as follows

In March2005, the
FASB issued FASB Interpretation 47 FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional
Asset Retirement Obligations. This interpretation is effective for 2005 and
subsequent years. It establishes that an entity is required to recognize a
liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if
the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The adoption
of FIN 47 did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December31,
2005. In June2005,
the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No143-1 FSP 143-1, Accounting
for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations, which provides guidance under SFAS
No143 with respect to European operations that has been adopted by the
European Union. FSP 143-1 requires a commercial user to incur costs associated
with the retirement of historical electrical equipment waste. FSP 143-1 became
effective the later of June8, 2005, or the date of the adoption of the
law by the applicable EU-member country. The Companys operations in Denmark
are subject to the new FSP 143-1, the adoption of which did not have a material
effect on the Companys financial position, cash flows or results of operations
for the year ended December31, 2005. Recently
Issued Accounting Standards In December2004,
the FASB issued SFAS No123R, Share Based Payment Revised 2004,
which revised SFAS No123 to require companies to record compensation
cost for stock-based employee compensation plans based on the fair value of
options granted. While the Company currently accounts for stock options on a
fair value basis, additional changes will be required such as those affecting
cash flow presentation whereby excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock
options will be presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a
financing activity rather than an operating activity, as currently presented.
SFAS No123R will be adopted in the first quarter of 2006.
The Company will use the modified prospective application approach as the
transition method, and management does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No123R
will have a material effect on the Companys financial position, operations or total
cash flows. In November2004, the FASB issued SFAS No151, Inventory Costsan amendment of ARB No43, Chapter 4, which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material spoilage. The requirements of SFAS Statement No151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005. Management has not determined the effect, if any, on the Companys financial statements for its fiscal year ending December31, 2006. In May2005, the
FASB issued SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a
replacement of APB Opinion 20 and FASB Statement No3. This Statement
will be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in 2006
and subsequent years. In the absence of explicit transition
requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle, it
establishes, unless not practicable, retrospective application as the required
method for reporting a change in accounting principle. Management does not
believe that the adoption of SFAS No154 on January1, 2006, will
have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements for
its fiscal year ending 2006. In November2005,
the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No115-1 FSP 115-1, The Meaning
of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments,
which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and
equity securities are considered impaired, whether that impairment is other-than-temporary,
and on measuring such impairment loss. FSP 115-1 also includes accounting
considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary
impairment and requires certain disclosure about unrealized losses that have
not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. FSP 115-1 is effective
for reporting periods beginning after December15, 2005. Management does
not believe FSP 115-1 will have a material effect on the Companys consolidated
financial statements. 47 2. Acquisitions In October2004, the
Company completed the acquisition of the assets of Quik Drive, U.S.A.,Inc.
and Quik Drive Canada,Inc. and 100% of the equity of Quik Drive Australia
Pty. Limited collectively Quik Drive. Quik Drive manufactures collated
fasteners and fastener delivery systems which are marketed in the U.S., Canada,
Australia and New Zealand. The purchase price, including post-closing
adjustments, of the acquisition was $320 million in cash and $50 million in
stock. The amounts of goodwill and intangible assets subject to amortization that
resulted from this purchase are $188 million and $102 million, respectively see
Note 1. Tangible assets, including inventory and trade accounts receivable,
accounted for the balance of the purchase price. The final purchase price
allocation resulted in $17 million allocated to customer relationships from
other categories of intangible assets and goodwill. In April2004, the
Companys Danish subsidiary acquired 100% of the shares of ATF Furrer Holz GmbH
ATF, in Switzerland, for $06 million. Substantially all of the purchase
price was allocated to patents and goodwill see Note 1. ATF distributes a
line of hidden connectors in some European countries. In May2003, Simpson
Strong-Tie Canada Limited, the Companys wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary,
completed the purchase of 100% of the equity of MGA Construction Hardware
Steel Fabricating Limited and MGA Connectors Limited, both Canadian federal
corporations collectively, MGA, for $98 million in cash. MGA manufactures
and distributes connector products throughout Canada and portions of the United
States. The amount of goodwill that resulted from this purchase was approximately
$67 million. Pro forma results of
operations for the acquisitions have not been presented as the effect has not
been significant for all periods presented. 3. Trade

respectively. These fully depreciated assets are still in use in the Companys
operations. Also included are land, buildings and building improvements of
consolidated VIEs see Note 16. 6. Investments The Company has a 35%
investment in Keymark Enterprises, LLC Keymark see Note 12, for which it
accounts using the equity method. Keymark develops software that assists in the
design and engineering of residential structures. The Companys relationship
with Keymark includes the specification of its products in the Keymark
software. The Company has no obligation to make any additional future capital
contributions. In 2001, the Company concluded that the carrying value of its
investment in Keymark exceeded its fair value and therefore wrote down the
value of its investment to zero. After three consecutive quarters of
profitability in 2004, however, the Company began recording its share of
Keymarks 2005 profits. As of December31, 2005, the carrying value of
undistributed earnings of this investment was $244 thousand, which is included
in the Companys consolidated retained earnings. During 2005, Keymark distributed
$40 thousand to the Company. Available-For-Sale
Investments As of December31,
2005, the Companys available-for-sale investments had either matured or were
redeemed. Prior to that, the Companys investments in all debt securities were

Company and its subsidiaries. The Company is in compliance with the various
loan covenants that govern its ability to borrow under its lines of credit. The covenants include a material adverse change
clause which would limit the availability of funds as a result of a material
adverse change to the Companys financial position or results of operations. The
Companys outstanding debt includes $36 million in non-recourse loans that
were payable by its consolidated variable interest entities see Note 16. The total interest
expense for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, was $194
thousand, $364 thousand and $378 thousand, respectively. Interest expense includes interest, maintenance
fees and bank charges. The amount of capitalized interest for the years
ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, was $195 thousand, $302 thousand
and $303 thousand, respectively. At December31, 2005, estimated future maturities of

9. Commitments
and Contingencies Leases Certain properties
occupied by the Company are leased. The leases expire at various dates through
2014 and generally require the Company to assume the obligations for insurance,
property taxes and maintenance of the facilities. Some of the properties are
leased from partnerships formed by current and former Company stockholders,
directors, officers and employees. Rental expenses under these related party
leases were as follows

Rental expense for 2005, 2004 and 2003 with respect to all
other leased property was approximately $56 million, $43 million and $45
million, respectively. As of December31, 2005, the Company has entered
into agreements to purchase the properties that it currently leases from Doolittle
Investors and Vacaville Investors for $50 million and $57 million,
respectively. The transactions are expected to be completed in March2006
and January2008, respectively. In May2005, the Company completed
the purchase, for $41 million, of the facility that it previously leased from
Columbus Westbelt Investment Co. Since both Doolittle Investors and Vacaville
Investors are consolidated VIEs, the future minimum lease payments associated
with those leases have been excluded from the table below. 51 At December31, 2005,
minimum rental commitments under all noncancelable leases are as follows

Some of these minimum
rental commitments that involve the related parties described above and in Note
12 contain renewal options and provide for periodic rental adjustments based on
changes in the consumer price index or current market rental rates. The nominal term of Simpson
Strong-Tie International Inc.s SSTIs lease in the United Kingdom is 25
years but includes an option to terminate without penalty in either the
fifteenth or twentieth year on one year written notice by SSTI. Future minimum
rental payments associated with the first 15 years of this lease are included
in minimum rental commitments in the table above. Employee
Relations Approximately
20% of the employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by
collective bargaining agreements. Two of the Companys collective bargaining
agreements cover the Companys sheetmetal and maintenance workers and its tool
and die craftsmen in Brea. These two contracts expire in June2007 and February2008,
respectively. Two other contracts, covering tool and die personnel and
sheetmetal workers in San Leandro, expire in June2007. The Companys
Stockton, California, facility is also a union facility. The collective
bargaining agreements at this facility expire in September2007. Environmental The
Companys policy with regard to environmental liabilities is to accrue for
future environmental assessments and remediation costs when information becomes
available that indicates that it is probable that the Company is liable for any
related claims and assessments and the amount of the liability is reasonably
estimable. At one
of the Companys operating facilities, evidence of contamination resulting from
activities of prior occupants was discovered. The Company took remedial actions
at the facility in 1990 and continues to monitor the condition of this
property. The Company does not believe that any further action will be required
or that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial
condition, cash flows or results of operations. Litigation From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation
that it considers to be in the normal course of its business. No such
litigation within the last five years resulted in any material loss. The
Company is not engaged in any legal proceedings as of the date hereof, which
the Company expects individually or in the aggregate to have a material adverse
effect on the Companys financial condition, cash flows or results of
operations. Litigation is, however, subject to inherent uncertainties and it is
possible that actual results could differ. Other Corrosion, hydrogen
enbrittlement, stress corrosion cracking, hardness, wood pressure-treating
chemicals, misinstallations, environmental conditions or other factors can
contribute to failure of fasteners and connectors. On occasion, some of the
fasteners that the Company sells have failed, although the Company has not
incurred any material liability resulting from those failures. The Company
attempts to avoid such failures by establishing and monitoring appropriate
product specifications, manufacturing quality control procedures, inspection
procedures and information on appropriate installation methods and conditions. 52 10. Income

The total
deferred tax assets for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
were $167 million, $125 million and $108 million, respectively. The total
deferred tax liabilities for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, were $31 million, $22 million and $08 million, respectively. The Company does not
provide for U.S. federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its
international subsidiaries because such earnings are reinvested and, in the
opinion of management, will continue to be reinvested indefinitely. At December31,
2005 and 2004, the Company had not provided federal income taxes on
undistributed earnings of $29 million and $07 million, respectively, from its
international subsidiaries. At December31, 2003, the Company did not have
undistributed earnings from its international subsidiaries. Should these
earnings be distributed in the formof dividends or otherwise, the Company
would be subject to both U.S. income taxes and withholding taxes in various
international jurisdictions. These taxes maybe partially offset by U.S.
foreign tax credits. Determination of the related amount of unrecognized
deferred U.S. income taxes is not practicable because of the complexities
associated with this hypothetical calculation. U.S. federal income taxes are
provided on the earnings of the Companys foreign branches, which are included
in the U.S. federal income tax return. The American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 AJCA, enacted on October22, 2004, includes
provisions for the phase-out of the extraterritorial income exclusion,
replacing it with a phased-in deduction for companies that pay income taxes on
manufacturing activities in the U.S. The new manufacturing deduction allows a
deduction from taxable income of up to 9% of qualified income from domestic
production activities. The deduction is phased in over a six-year period, from
3% in 2005 to 9% in 2010. The AJCA also creates a temporary incentive for U.S.
multinationals to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85%
dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign
corporations. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations.On December21,
2004, the FASB issued two FASB Staff Positions FSPs regarding the
accounting implications of the AJCA related to 1the manufacturing
deduction for qualified domestic production activities and 2the
one-time tax benefit for the repatriation of foreign earnings. The FASB decided
that the deduction for qualified domestic production activities should be
accounted for as a special deduction under SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes.The
FASB also confirmed, that on deciding that some amount of earnings will be
repatriated, a company must record in that period the associated tax
liability.The guidance in the FSPs applies to consolidated financial
statements for periods ending after the date the AJCA was enacted. The Company
expects that the tax benefits realizable from the manufacturing deduction
should exceed the loss of tax benefits due to the phase out of the
extraterritorial income exclusion. The Company further decided not to utilize
the tax benefit for the repatriation of foreign earnings, in view of the
managements current opinion that undistributed earnings of the Companys
international subsidiaries will be reinvested indefinitely. 54 11. Retirement
Plans The Company has six defined contribution retirement plans covering
substantially all salaried employees and nonunion hourly employees. Two of the
plans, covering U.S. employees, provide for annual contributions in amounts
that the Board of Directors mayauthorize, subject to certain limitations,
but in no event more than the amounts permitted under the Internal Revenue Code
as deductible expense. The other four plans, covering the Companys European
and Canadian employees, require the Company to make contributions ranging from
3% to 15% of the employees compensation. The total cost for these retirement
plans for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, was $82
million, $74 million and $63 million, respectively. The Company also
contributes to various industry-wide, union-sponsored pension funds, for hourly
employees who are members of a union. Payments to these funds aggregated $32
million, $22 million and $20 million for the years ended December31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 12. Related
Party Transactions In 2003, the Company purchased 10 million shares of its common stock
for $235 million from the Simpson PSB Fund to offset the dilution of stock
options granted in 2003. The Chairman and the President and Chief Executive
Officer of the Company, who are directors and significant stockholders of the
Company, serve as directors and officers of the Simpson PSB Fund a charitable
organization. The price per share was $23525, which was $025 less than the
closing price on the day before the transaction. The independent members of the
Board of Directors unanimously approved this transaction. In 2003, the Company paid $05 million for an additional 5% ownership
interest in Keymark. The Company owns 35% of Keymark see Note 6. In 2003, the Companys Chief Executive Officer leased an airplane that
is managed by a charter company unrelated to the Company. The Company pays the
charter company standard hourly rates when this airplane is hired for use by
its Chief Executive Officer in travel between his home and Company offices or
by him and other Company employees in travel on Company business. As lessee of
the airplane, the Companys Chief Executive Officer is also responsible for its
maintenance and receives a portion of each payment to the charter company for
its use, whether by the Company or others. The total cost to the Company for
this and other airplanes that are used, including $22 thousand, $29 thousand
and $35 thousand paid to the Companys Chief Executive Officer for compensation
for the years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, was $260 thousand, $380
thousand and $352 thousand in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
independent members of the Board of Directors unanimously approved this
arrangement. The Company computes the compensation cost of the use of airplanes
using the Standard Industrial Fare Level SIFL tables prescribed under
applicable Internal Revenue Service regulations. In 2004 and 2003, the Company paid $4 thousand and $90 thousand,
respectively, to Barclay Simpson Fine Arts, an art gallery owned by the Companys
Chairman, for artwork to decorate the Companys offices. The independent
members of the Board of Directors unanimously approved these purchases after a
review of an independent appraisal and a review of the cost of comparable
artwork. In December2004, the Company made a donation in
the amount of $5 thousand to the African American Experience Fund of the
National Park Foundation, whose Chairman is Barry Lawson Williams, a director
of the Company. In January2005, Michael Petrovic was appointed as an
officer of Simpson Strong-Tie Canada, Limited SSTC, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Simpson Strong-Tie. Mr.Petrovic was an owner of MGA, which SSTC
acquired in 2003, and is a co-lessor of the property that SSTC leases in Maple
Ridge, British Columbia. SSTC estimates that it will pay $160 thousand per year
to lease the property from Mr.Petrovic and his associates. The lease
expires in 2007. In February2005, the Company paid $50 thousand
to the California College of the Arts CCA to sponsor the development of a
unique interdisciplinary course. The Companys Chairman, Barclay Simpson, is
the Vice Chairman of CCAs Board of Trustees. The independent members of the
Board of Directors approved the sponsorship of this course. 55 In May2005, the Company completed the purchase, for $41
million, of the property that it previously leased from a related party in
Columbus, Ohio, and is expanding this facility on land adjacent to that
property. The transaction was unanimously approved by the independent members
of the Companys Board of Directors. In July2005, the
Company entered into an agreement to purchase the Vacaville, California, property
that it currently leases from a related party partnership, Vacaville Investors,
which consists primarily of current and past employees and directors of the
Company. The purchase price is $57 million and the transaction is expected to
be completed in January2008. The transaction was unanimously approved by
the independent members of the Companys Board of Directors see Note 16. In
December 2005, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase the property
in San Leandro, California, that it currently leases from a related party
partnership, Doolittle Investors, which consists primarily of current and past
employees and directors of the Company, for $50 million. The transaction is
expected to close in the first quarter of 2006. The transaction was unanimously
approved by the independent members of the Companys Board of Directors see
Note 16. See Note
9 regarding related party transactions involving Company leases. 13. Stock
Option and Stock Bonus Plans The Company currently has
two stock option plans. The Simpson Manufacturing Co. Inc., 1994 Stock Option
Plan the 1994 Plan is principally for the Companys employees and the Simpson
Manufacturing Co.,Inc., 1995 Independent Director Stock Option Plan the 1995
Plan is for the Companys independent directors. Participants are granted
options only if the company-wide and/or profit center operating goals,
established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the
beginning of the year, are met. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company met most
of the operating goals established for both of its stock option plans and granted
options to purchase 05 million, 12 million and 10 million shares in 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company has recognized after-tax expense totaling
$37 million in 2005 for options granted in 2005, 2004 and 2003. The options
have exercise prices ranging from $3490 to $3839 per share for the options
granted in 2005, from $2304 to $2797 per share for the options granted in 2004,
and from $1645 to $1810 per share for the options granted in 2003. In 2005,
the Company met most of the operating goals established for both of its stock
option plans and committed to grant options to purchase 05 million shares in
2006, with exercise prices ranging from $3927 to $4479 per share. The following table

The
tax benefit to the Company from the exercise of stock options, a reduction of
the Companys income tax payable, was $38 million, $29 million and $18
million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company also
maintains a Stock Bonus Plan whereby it awards shares to employees, who do not
otherwise participate in one of the Companys stock option plans. The number of
shares awarded, as well as the period of service, are considered by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, at its discretion. In 2005,
2004 and 2003, the Company committed
to issue 6 thousand, 21 thousand and 17 thousand shares, respectively, which
resulted in pre-tax compensation charges of $05 million, $11 million and $08
million, respectively. These employees are also awarded cash bonuses, which are
included in this charge, to compensate for their income taxes payable as a
result of the stock bonuses. For the past years, the shares were issued in the
year following the year in which the employee reached his or her tenth
anniversary. 14. Segment
Information The Company is organized
into two primary operating segments. The segments are defined by types of
products manufactured, marketed and distributed to the Companys customers. The
two product segments are connector products and venting products. These
segments are differentiated in several ways, including the types of materials,
the production processes, the distribution channels and the product applications.
Transactions between the two segments were immaterial for each of the years
presented. 57 The following table
illustrates certain measurements used by management to assess the performance
of the segments described above as of December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, or
for the years then ended

management accounts, and therefore has been included in the total assets of Administrative
and All Other. Cash and short-term investment balances in the Administrative

Net sales and
long-lived assets, net of intangible assets, are attributable to the country
where the operations are located. 58 Net sales of 17%, 18%
and 11% in the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively,
were to one customer and were attributable mostly to the connector products segment.
Most of the increase in net sales attributable to this customer from 2003 to
2004 was a result of its acquisition of another of the Companys customers in mid-2004.
The percentage of the Companys net sales for 2004 has been computed as if the
two customers were combined for all of 2004. 15. Selected

internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rules13a-15fand
15d-15f that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, its internal controls over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting.Management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as defined in Rule13a-15funder the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, using
criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and concluded that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2005. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting maynot
prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls maybecome
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies and procedures maydeteriorate. The
Companys assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
as stated in its report, which is included herein. PARTIII
