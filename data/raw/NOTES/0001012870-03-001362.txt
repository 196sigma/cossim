43 DOCENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.Organization and Basis of Presentation The Company is a provider of eLearning products and services
that enable the exchange of knowledge within and among large enterprises. The Companys Internet-based platform provides for the delivery of learning content online. Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including
the reclassification of certain accrued liabilities to account payable and gForce intangible asset amortization to cost of license. All share and per share data included in the consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect a one-for-three
reverse split approved by the Companys Board of Directors in October 2002. 2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates estimates, including those related to revenue, allowance for doubtful accounts, intangible assets and restructuring. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Cash and
Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents
are comprised of highly liquid financial instruments consisting primarily of investments in money market funds and commercial paper, with insignificant interest rate risk and with original maturities of three months or less at the time of
acquisition. Short-term Investments
Short-term investments are stated at
amounts that approximate fair value based on quoted market prices. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, management
determines the appropriate classification of the debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates the designation as of each balance sheet date. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company classified all of the debt securities as
available-for-sale pursuant to SFAS No. 115. Short-term investments consist principally of taxable, corporate bonds and money market instruments with maturities or callable dates between 90 days and one year. Restricted Cash At December 31, 2002, the Company had $46,000 of restricted
cash for a Corporate Credit Card deposit. At December 31, 2001, the Company had $456,000 of restricted cash for a lease deposit on the Companys former Sunnyvale, California facility. Fair value of financial instruments Carrying amounts of certain of the Companys financial instruments including cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to 
44 DOCENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
their short maturities. The carrying amounts of notes payable and capital lease obligations approximate fair value based on the terms of
similar borrowing arrangements available to the Company. Risks and uncertainties The Company is subject to all of the risks inherent in a company that operates in the intensely competitive Internet industry, providing a service that is relatively new and constantly evolving. These risks include, but are not
limited to, market acceptance of the Companys products and services, and reliance on third-party software incorporated in the Companys products. The Companys operating results may be materially affected by the foregoing
factors. Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. The Companys cash and cash equivalents are deposited with four financial institutions, which, at
times, may exceed federally insured limits. Accounts receivable include amounts due from customers in a wide variety of industries, primarily in the United States and Europe. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers, does not require collateral and
maintains allowances for potential credit losses when deemed necessary. To date, such losses have been within managements expectations. At December 31, 2002, the Company had no accounts receivable due from a single customer greater than 10% of
total accounts receivable. At December 31, 2001, the Company had accounts receivable from one customer representing 14% of total accounts receivable. Revenue recognition The Company derives its revenue from the licensing of its software, either through perpetual or time-based licenses, maintenance and
support, hosting and professional services, including implementation, consulting and training. In accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA Statement of Position 97-2, as amended, the Company recognizes revenue from licensing our software if all
of the following conditions are met: There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; The Company has delivered the product to the customer; Collection of the fees is probable; and The amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. For arrangements requiring customer acceptance, revenue recognition is deferred until the earlier of the end
of the acceptance period or until written notice of acceptance is received from the customer. The Company considers all arrangements with payment terms longer than normal not to be fixed or determinable. The Companys normal payment terms
currently range from net 30 days to net 60 days. For arrangements involving extended payment terms, revenue recognition generally occurs when payments are due. For arrangements involving time-based licenses, customers pay a fee based on the number of users, and such
fees include maintenance and support. Objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the related maintenance and support, as maintenance and support are not offered separately for such time-based arrangements. In these cases, the Company
recognizes the entire arrangement fee ratably over the contractual maintenance and support period, which is generally one year. The Company has allocated the time-based license and maintenance revenue based on their relative costs. 
45 DOCENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
For
arrangements involving a significant amount of services related to installation, modification or customization of the Companys software products, the Company recognizes revenue using the percentage-of-completion method. However, where there
are customer acceptance clauses that the Company does not have an established history of meeting or which are not considered to be routine, the Company recognizes revenue when the arrangement has been completed and accepted by the customer.
For arrangements that include multiple elements,
such as a product license, maintenance and support, hosting and professional services, the Company allocates revenue to all undelivered elements, usually maintenance and support, hosting and professional services, based on objective evidence of the
fair value of those elements. Fair value is
specific to the Company and represents the price for which the Company sells each element separately. Any amount remaining is allocated using the residual method to the delivered elements, generally only the product license, and recognized as
revenue when the conditions discussed above are satisfied. The Company recognizes revenue from fees for ongoing maintenance and support ratably over the period of the maintenance and support agreement, which is generally one year. The Company recognizes revenue allocated to, or fees
generated from, the separate selling of professional services as the related services are performed. Fees associated with hosting and application service provider ASP services are recognized ratably over the period of the hosting
agreement, which is generally one year. For
arrangements with the Companys content providers, the minimum fee is allocated among the separate elements, including professional services and hosting, based on the fair value of each of these elements. Any minimum royalty amount is
recognized as revenue ratably over the period in which it is earned, which is generally one year. Any royalty over and above the minimum is recognized upon receipt of a revenue report from the content provider. Revenue from sales to resellers is recognized upon the receipt
of a purchase order or a sales contract from the reseller and when the end customer has been identified, provided all the conditions for revenue recognition set forth above have been met. No right of return exists for these sales. Customer billings that have not been recognized as revenue in
accordance with the above policies are shown on the balance sheet as deferred revenue. Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are generally calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from 3 to
5 years. Leasehold improvements and assets acquired under capital leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, or the useful life of the assets, whichever is shorter. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred, and improvements and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the
statement of operations for the period realized. Goodwill The Company
evaluates the recoverability of its goodwill, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS 142 prescribes a two-phase, if necessary, measure of
impairment. The Company performed the required annual impairment test of 
46 DOCENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
goodwill as of October 1, 2002. The Company considers itself to be a single reporting unit. Accordingly, all of the Companys goodwill
is associated with the entire company. As of October 1, 2002, based on the estimated fair value of the Company, there was no impairment of goodwill recorded. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate
commensurate with the risk involved. When determining the discount rate, the Company considered the inherent risks associated with an early stage company that has yet to reached profitability. The Company will perform an interim impairment analysis
if circumstances dictate. Any reduction of the enterprise fair value below the carrying amount of goodwill could require the Company to write down the value and record an expense for the impairment loss. Intangible and other long lived assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of its intangible
and other long lived assets, in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The Company performed an impairment test of intangible assets as of October 1, 2002. As of October 1, 2002,
based on the discounted cashflows expected during its remaining useful life, to its carrying value, there was no impairment of intangible assets recorded. The Company will perform an interim impairment analysis if circumstances dictate.
Website Development costs The Company accounts for Website development costs in
accordance with the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force 00-2 EITF, Accounting for Website Development Costs. EITF 00-2 requires all costs related to the development of websites other than those incurred during the application development
stage to be expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage are required to be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. As of December 31, 2002, the Company has capitalized website
development costs and recorded them under other assets. Capitalized Software Costs related to internally developed software and software purchased for internal use, which are required to be capitalized pursuant to Statement of Position SOP No. 98-1, Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed
or Obtained for Internal Use, are included in property, plant and equipment. Research and development Costs incurred in the research and development of new software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established. Development costs are capitalized beginning when a
products technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general release to customers. Technological feasibility is reached when the product reaches the beta stage. To date, software development
costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility have not been significant, and all software development costs have been charged to research and development expenses. Shipping Costs The Companys shipping and handling costs are included
under cost of sales for all periods presented. Advertising Costs
related to advertising and promotion of products is charged to sales and marketing expense as incurred. Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, was $4,000, $324,000, and $19 million, respectively.

Income
taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are
established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized. Stock-based compensation The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method in accordance with provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation FIN No. 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans, and complies with the
disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure. Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is based on the difference,
if any, on the date of grant, between the estimated fair value of the Companys common stock and the exercise price. SFAS 123 defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity investment.
The pro forma disclosures of the difference between the compensation expense included in net loss and the related cost measured by the fair value method are presented in Note 10. The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to nonemployees in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or
Services. Accumulated other comprehensive

expenses are remeasured at the average exchange rate prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from translation of the subsidiarys accounts are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Foreign currency
transaction gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations. The aggregate exchange gain included in the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $287,000. The aggregate exchange gain loss included
in the results of operations for the years ended December31 2001 and 2000 was insignificant.

Recently issued accounting pronouncements In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit and Disposal
Activities. This statement revises the accounting for exit and disposal activities under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity.
Commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of long-lived assets will no longer be sufficient to record a one-time charge for most anticipated costs. Instead, SFAS 146 requires exit or disposal costs be recorded when they are
incurred and can be measured at fair value. SFAS 146 further requires that the recorded liability be adjusted for changes in estimated cash flows. The provisions of SFAS 146 are effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities
initiated after December 31, 2002. Previously issued financial statements cannot be restated for the effect of the provisions of SFAS 146 and liabilities previously recorded under EITF Issue No. 94-3 are grandfathered. We do not believe SFAS 146
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure. SFAS 148 amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide
alternative methods of transition for an entity that changes to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123 to require expanded and more prominent
disclosure of the effects of an entitys accounting policy with respect to stock-based employee compensation. This disclosure will be required in the summary of significant accounting policies footnote or its equivalent in annual and interim
financial statements. SFAS 148 does not amend SFAS 123 to require companies to account for their stock-based employee awards using the fair value method. We do not believe SFAS 148 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued
Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others FIN 45. FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor
in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the
obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. We have adopted the disclosure requirements of FIN 45 as of December 31, 2002. In addition, we are required to adopt the initial recognition and measurement of the fair value of the obligation
undertaken in issuing the guarantee on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We do not believe FIN 45 will have a material effect on our operations, financial position or cash flows.

5.Acquisition and Intangible Assets On October 16, 2001, the Company acquired gForce Systems,
Inc. gForce, a leading provider of rapid eLearning content management and delivery solutions. The Company acquired gForce to extend its existing product line. The Company accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of
accounting. Goodwill was subsequently reduced by $140,000 in the three months ended June 30, 2002 to $760,000, due to the settlement of a liability for an amount less than the amount recorded at the time of the acquisition. The following table

Company acquired gForce by assuming liabilities of $4,743,000 and providing an advance payment of $119,000. The Company also incurred approximately $420,000 of acquisition costs, for a total purchase price of $5,282,000. To settle certain gForce
liabilities, we issued 166,666 shares of our common stock valued at an aggregate amount of $1,019,000. To cover any undisclosed pre-acquisition claims against gForce, of the 166,666 total shares issued, the Company placed 41,667 shares of the
Companys common stock in escrow for 18 months. To determine the value of the developed technology, the expected future cash flow attributed to all existing technology was discounted, taking into account risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology,
existing and future markets, and assessments of the life cycle stage of technology, existing and future markets, and assessments of the life cycle stage of technology. The $707,000 assigned to research and development assets represented acquired
in-process research and development IPRD that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. We wrote off these assets at the date of acquisition in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board Interpretation No. 4, Applicability of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 2 to Business Combination Accounted for by the Purchase Method. To estimate the value of the IPRD, the expected cash flows attributed to the
completed portion of the IPRD were calculated. These cash flows considered the contribution of the core technology, the risks related to the development of the IPRD and the percent complete as of the valuation date as well as the expected
life cycle of the technology. Finally, the cash flows attributed to the completed portion of the IPRD, net of the core 
52 DOCENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
technology contribution, were discounted to the present value to estimate the value of the IPRD. Goodwill is determined based on the
residual difference between the amount paid and the values assigned to identified tangible and intangible assets. Goodwill is not being amortized. The results of operations of gForce from October 16, 2001 to December 31, 2002 were included in the Companys statements of
operations. The following unaudited pro forma
information represents the results of operations for the Company and gForce for the years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, as if the acquisition had been consummated as of January 1, 2001 and January 1, 2000, respectively. This pro

In 2002 and 2001, the Company implemented
restructuring programs to better align operating expenses with anticipated revenues. During the third quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company recorded a $42 million restructuring charge, which consisted of $30 million in facility exit costs, $704,000 in employee severance costs, $224,000
in equipment impairment and $211,000 in other exit costs. The restructuring program resulted in a reduction in force across all company functions of approximately 11%, or 35 employees. 
53 DOCENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
During the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company recorded a $19 million restructuring charge, which consisted of $779,000 in facility exit costs, $833,000 in employee severance costs, $144,000 in equipment impairment and $188,000 in other exit costs. The
restructuring program resulted in a reduction in force across all company functions of approximately 16%, or 45 employees. These facility exit costs include an adjustment of $112,000 related to the restructuring recorded during the third quarter of
fiscal 2001. The adjustment reflects the reduction of the estimated sublease income of a particular vacated facility. During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company recorded a $925,000 restructuring charge, which consisted of $886,000 in employee
severance costs and $39,000 in other exit costs. The restructuring program resulted in a reduction in force across all company functions of approximately 17%, or 42 employees. During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company recorded a $31 million restructuring charge, which
consisted of $21 million in facility exit costs, $822,000 in employee severance costs, $163,000 in equipment impairment, and $27,000 in other exit costs. The restructuring program resulted in a reduction in force across all company functions of
approximately 17%, or 36 employees. If the Company fails to sublease an exited facility, or the assumptions used for estimated time to sublease and sublease price are incorrect, an additional charge not exceeding $94,000 will occur. During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company
increased its estimate of the total costs associated with the above restructuring activities and recorded an adjustment of $298,000. The adjustment reflects the reduction of the estimated sublease income of one vacated facility in the amount of
$372,000, partially offset by the settlement cost of another lease obligation in the amount of $74,000. During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company continued the announced second quarter restructuring actions. The Company recorded a
$381,000 restructuring charge, which consisted of $271,000 in employee severance costs, and $110,000 in equipment impairment. The continued restructuring program resulted in a reduction in force across all company functions of approximately 5%, or
nine employees. Also during the third quarter of
fiscal 2002, the Company settled a facility lease obligation of a vacated facility, associated with the above restructuring activities, and recorded an adjustment of $16 million. The adjustment reflects a reduction of the future monthly lease
payments that were originally estimated to be $30million, but were settled for $14 million. The following table depicts the restructuring activity during 2002 in thousands:  Balanceat Dec31,2001

Purchase commitment As of December 31, 2002, the Company was committed to purchase $640,000 of consulting services from Accenture, prior to April 1, 2003. In
2002, 2001, and 2000 the Company purchased consulting services under the agreement of $367,000, $541,000 and $452,000. In September 2002, Docent entered into an agreement with a third party software company to resell that Companys product through
April 2005. Under the agreement, Docent committed to purchase $10 million of the third party software and pay the third party software company $10 million over the first year of the agreement for the distributed software. If the Company fails to
resell $10 million during the first year, the Company will pay the third party software company the remaining unsold balance due. The payment for the remaining unsold balance will be credited to future purchases over the life of the agreement. In
2002, the Company did not make any payments associated with the commitment to the third party software company. Contingencies On May 31, 2002, IP Learn, LLC filed a patent infringement case against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California. In December 2002, IP Innovation, LLC filed a patent infringement case against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The Company believes that the patent infringement cases are
without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously. However, if these third party claims for infringement and their patents are valid, the Company may be required to license the patents on terms that may or may not be favorable or be forced
to alter its website or its software product which is the subject of the patents, either of which results may adversely affect its revenue. Also, from time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the Companys ordinary course
of business. The Company believes that there are no claims or actions pending or threatened against them, the ultimate disposition of which would have a material adverse effect on it. 9.Receivables from Stockholders In conjunction with the purchase of 325,000 shares of common stock in June 1997 by an officer of the Company,
the Company received a non recourse note for $97,000 with a twenty-year term and an interest rate of 6%. This loan was outstanding at December 31, 2002.

October 2002. Following the authorization from the Companys stockholders, the Companys Board of Directors approved a one-for-three reverse stock split ratio. All information regarding common stock and earnings per share amounts have been
restated within this Form 10-K to reflect the reverse split. Common stock repurchase plan In October 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $50 million worth of the Companys common stock. In October 2002, the Companys Board of
Directors re-authorized the Companys common stock repurchase program for another 12months. Such repurchases are to be made in the open market from time to time, and can be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Such
repurchases may be used to offset the issuance of additional shares resulting from employee stock option exercises and the sale of shares under the employee stock purchase plan. Through December 31, 2002, the Company had repurchased 1,230,635 shares
of common stock for a total purchase price of $3,058,000. Preferred stock In
September 2000, upon completion of Docents initial public offering, all outstanding preferred shares converted to common stock. Accordingly, all outstanding warrants to purchase preferred stock likewise became warrants to purchase common
stock. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had 5,000,000 preferred shares authorized and no shares issued. Docents Board of Directors has the authority to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, privileges
and related restrictions.

periods. Price declines, if any, will be reflected at the beginning of each six-month accumulation period and remain in effect for the next 12-month 
58 DOCENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued

Stock-based compensation In connection with certain stock option grants to employees during the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company recognized approximately $27,355,000 and $8,466,000 of unearned stock-based compensation for the excess of the
deemed fair value of the shares of common stock subject to such options over the exercise price of these options at the date of grant. Such amounts are included as a reduction of stockholders equity and are being amortized using the graded
amortization method over the vesting period of generally four years. The graded amortization method records more expense early in the life of the options. The 2002 termination of certain Docent officers with unvested options, that had already been
expensed under the graded method, created a net stock-based compensation credit of $193,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $11,187,000 and $11,971,000 for the years ended December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively. Stock-based
compensation expense related to equity instruments granted to consultants is recognized as earned. At each reporting date, the Company re-values any unvested equity investments using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. As a result, the
stock-based compensation expense will fluctuate as the fair market value of the Companys common stock fluctuates. The Company granted options to purchase 18,000, 2,500 and 34,313 shares of its common stock to consultants during the years ended December
31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2002, the Company recorded $14,000 amortized stock based compensation associated with the 2002 option grants. In 2001, the Company recorded compensation expense of $44,000 associated with the 2001 options.
During the year ended December 31, 2000 the
Company issued 56,486 shares of common stock with fair values of $1,402,000, in exchange for services from consultants. A total of $1,146,000 relating to these issuances was expensed during the years ended December 31, 2000. The Company did not
issue any common stock to consultants in 2002 and 2001. The Company terminated the employment of certain officers during 2002 and 2001. In connection with the terminations, the Company accelerated the vesting on certain stock options held by the employees and recorded a compensation
charge of $14,000 and $198,000 related to the re-measurement of these options at the date of termination for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $12,880,000 in respect of warrants issued to
consultants and strategic partners in exchange for services during the year ended December 31, 2000. 11.Segment reporting Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
SFAS 131 requires that companies report separately in the financial statements certain financial and descriptive information about operating segments profit or loss, certain specific revenue and expense items and segment assets.
Additionally, companies are required to report information about the revenue derived from their products and service groups, about geographic areas in which the Company earns revenue and holds assets, and about major customers. The Company has one

Net loss
before income taxes attributed to foreign and domestic operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $2,297,000 and $21,344,000, respectively. Net loss before income taxes attributed to foreign operations for the years ended December 31, 2001
and 2000 was insignificant. At December 31,
2002, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $125 million and $51 million respectively, available to offset future taxable income. The Companys federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards
will expire in the years 2004 through 2022, if not utilized. At December 31, 2002, the Company also has federal and state research and development credit carry-forwards of approximately $1,000,000 and $900,000, respectively. The federal carry-forwards will expire in the years 2018 through
2022, if not fully utilized. Utilization of the
net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration
of net operating losses and credits before utilization. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components
of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows in thousands:  December 31 2002 2001 Net operating losses

Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, a valuation allowance, in an amount equal to the net deferred tax assets as of December31, 2002
has been established to reflect these uncertainties. The valuation allowance increased by $8,040,000, $16,668,000 and $15,478,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Approximately $280,000 of the valuation allowance is
attributable to stock options, the benefit of which will be credited to paid-in capital when realized. 13.Net loss per share Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss for the period by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period, less outstanding unvested shares. The calculation of diluted net loss per share excludes potential common shares as the effect is antidilutive, due to the Company net loss in each period. Potential common
shares are comprised of common stock subject to repurchase rights, incremental shares of common and preferred stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options or warrants and shares issuable upon conversion of convertible preferred stock.

agreement provides for the resale of the Companys software products and services by Accenture, the submission of joint proposals to potential clients where either the Company would be subcontracting the Companys services to Accenture or
Accenture would be subcontracting its services to the Company; the alliance agreement also provides for revenue sharing. The alliance agreement is for an initial term of three years, terminating on March31, 2003, with either party having the
right to terminate the agreement without cause on 60days notice. The alliance agreement automatically renews for an additional two-year term, terminating on March 31, 2005, unless either party notifies the other at least ninety days
prior to the expiration of the term of its intent not to renew. As of February 28, 2003, neither Accenture nor the Company had given notification of any intent not to renew. At September 30, 2002, the Company believes Accenture held approximately 72,000 shares of the Companys
common stock and had warrants, expiring on March 31, 2003, to purchase an additional 799,000 shares at $2256 per share. Accentures holdings in the Companys common stock on a fully diluted basis on September 30, 2002 represented
approximately 60% of the outstanding shares of the Companys common stock. In December 2002, Accenture sold all of their Docent common stock and warrants. 
65 DOCENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
As part of
the alliance agreement, Accenture resells the Companys software products to third party customers. In 2002, the Company recognized $324,000 of revenue from Accenture as part of this resale arrangement. In 2001, the Company recognized $864,000
of revenue from Accenture as part of this resale arrangement. Pricing for Accenture resale agreements represents the fair value of comparable resale agreements with the Companys other reseller partners. In 2000, the Company sold to Accenture a
Docent Enterprise software license for Accentures internal use and recognized $663,000 of associated revenue. Pricing for this internal use license represents the fair value of comparable agreements with unaffiliated third parties at the time
of the sale. A component of the alliance
agreement with Accenture is revenue sharing. When Accenture introduces the Company to prospective third party customers, Accenture is entitled to a portion of the contracted license fee if the Company sells a license directly to such prospective
