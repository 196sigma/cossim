MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  Management of Marriott International, Inc. the Company is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Companys Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  The Companys internal control over financial reporting is supported by
written policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the Companys transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets; 2provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that
could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  In connection with the preparation of the Companys annual consolidated financial statements, management has undertaken an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December30, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission the COSO Framework. Managements assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls.  Based on this assessment, management has concluded that as of
December30, 2005, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Companys consolidated financial statements included in this report, has issued an attestation report on managements assessment of
internal control over financial reporting, a copy of which appears on the next page of this annual report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Marriott International,
Inc.:  We have audited managements assessment, included
in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Marriott International, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December30, 2005, based on criteria established
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Marriott International, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  In our opinion, managements assessment that Marriott International, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December30, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Marriott International, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December30, 2005, based on the COSO criteria.  We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheet of Marriott International, Inc. as of December30, 2005 and December31, 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, comprehensive income and shareholders equity for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December30, 2005, of Marriott International, Inc. and our report dated February
21, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  /s/ Ernst Young LLP  McLean, Virginia February 21, 2006

opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We

MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Basis of Presentation  The consolidated financial statements present the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Marriott International, Inc.
together with its subsidiaries, we, us or the Company.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
as of the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the disclosures of contingent liabilities. Accordingly, ultimate results could differ from those estimates. We have
reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to our 2005 presentation.  As a result of the sale of our Senior Living Services communities and management business, the balances and activities of Senior Living Services have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations for all
periods presented.  In our opinion, the
accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position at fiscal year-end 2005 and fiscal year-end 2004 and the results of our operations and cash flows for
fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003. We have eliminated all material intercompany transactions and balances between entities consolidated in these financial statements.  Fiscal Year  Our fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest to December31. All fiscal years presented include 52 weeks. Unless otherwise specified,
each reference to 2005 means our fiscal year ended December30, 2005, each reference to 2004 means our fiscal year ended December31, 2004, each reference to 2003 means our fiscal year ended
January2, 2004, and each reference to 2002 means our fiscal year ended January3, 2003, and not, in each case, the corresponding calendar year.  Revenue Recognition  Our revenues include 1base and incentive management fees, 2franchise fees, 3revenues from lodging properties and
other businesses owned or leased by us, 4timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales and services, 5cost reimbursements, and 6sales made by the synthetic fuel operation while consolidated. Management fees
comprise a base fee, which is a percentage of the revenues of hotels, and an incentive fee, which is generally based on hotel profitability. Franchise fees comprise initial application fees and continuing royalties generated from our franchise
programs, which permit the hotel owners and operators to use certain of our brand names. Cost reimbursements include direct and indirect costs that are reimbursed to us by lodging properties that we manage or franchise.  Base and Incentive Management Fees: We recognize base fees as revenue
when earned in accordance with the contract. In interim periods and at year-end, we recognize incentive fees that would be due as if the contract were to terminate at that date, exclusive of any termination fees payable or receivable by us.
Franchise Fee Revenue: We recognize franchise fees as
revenue in each accounting period as fees are earned from the franchisee.  Owned and Leased Units: We recognize room sales and revenues from guest services for our owned and leased units when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered.  Timeshare and Fractional Intervals: We recognize sales when
1we have received a minimum of 10 percent of the purchase price for the timeshare interval, 2the purchasers period to cancel for a refund has expired, 3we deem the receivables to be collectible, and 4we have
attained certain minimum sales and construction levels. We defer all revenue using the deposit method for sales that do not meet all four of these criteria. For sales that do not qualify for full revenue recognition as the project has progressed
beyond the preliminary stages but has not yet reached completion, all revenue and profit are deferred and recognized in earnings using the percentage of completion method. 
64 Table of Contents
Timeshare Whole Ownership: We recognize sales under the full accrual method of accounting when we
receive our proceeds and transfer title at settlement.  Cost Reimbursements: We recognize cost reimbursements from managed, franchised and timeshare properties when we incur the related reimbursable costs.  Synthetic Fuel: Prior to November7, 2003, and after March25, 2004, we accounted for the
synthetic fuel operation by consolidating the joint ventures. We recognize revenue from the synthetic fuel operation when the synthetic fuel is produced and sold. From November7, 2003, through March25, 2004, we accounted for the
synthetic fuel operation using the equity method of accounting. See Footnote 2 Synthetic Fuel for additional information.  Other Revenue includes land rental income and other revenue. In 2003, we recorded a $36 million insurance settlement for lost
management fees associated with the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel, which was destroyed in the 2001 terrorist attacks.  Ground Leases  We are both the lessor and lessee of land under long-term operating leases, which include scheduled increases in minimum rents. We
recognize these scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term.  Real Estate Sales  We account for the sales of real estate in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards FAS No66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. We reduce gains on sales of real estate by the
maximum exposure to loss if we have continuing involvement with the property and do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. We reduced gains on sales of real estate due to maximum exposure to loss by $45 million in
2005, $1 million in 2004 and $4 million in 2003. In sales transactions where we retain a management contract, the terms and conditions of the management contract are comparable to the terms and conditions of the management contracts obtained
directly with third-party owners in competitive bid processes.  Profit Sharing Plan  We
contribute to a profit sharing plan for the benefit of employees meeting certain eligibility requirements and electing participation in the plan. Contributions are determined based on a specified percentage of salary deferrals by participating
employees. We recognized compensation cost from profit sharing of $69 million in 2005, $70 million in 2004 and $53 million in 2003. We recognized additional compensation cost from profit sharing of $1 million in 2003 related to the discontinued
Senior Living Services and Distribution Services businesses.  Self-Insurance Programs  We
are self-insured for certain levels of property, liability, workers compensation and employee medical coverage. We accrue estimated costs of these self-insurance programs at the present value of projected settlements for known and incurred but
not reported claims. We use a discount rate of 48 percent to determine the present value of the projected settlements, which we consider to be reasonable given our history of settled claims, including payment patterns and the fixed nature of the
individual settlements.  Marriott Rewards  Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program.
Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our lodging operations, purchases of timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership products and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners
programs, such as those offered by airlines and credit card companies. Points, which we track on members behalf, can be redeemed for stays at most of our lodging operations, airline tickets, airline frequent flyer program miles, rental cars
and a variety of other awards; however, points cannot be redeemed for cash. We provide Marriott Rewards as a marketing program to participating properties. We charge the cost of operating the program, including the estimated cost of award
redemption, to properties based on members qualifying expenditures.  We defer revenue received from managed, franchised and Marriott-owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future
redemption obligation based on statistical formulas which project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including an estimate of the breakage for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points
that will eventually be redeemed. These judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points.  Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including
marketing, promotion, communication with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that hotels reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue
from hotels in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at 
65 Table of Contents
the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program
partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the
costs of the awards redeemed. Our liability for the Marriott Rewards program was $1,085 million at year-end 2005, and $942 million at year-end 2004.  Guarantees  We record a liability for the fair value of a guarantee on the date a guarantee is issued or modified. The offsetting entry depends on the
circumstances in which the guarantee was issued. Funding under the guarantee reduces the recorded liability. When no funding is forecasted, the liability is amortized into income on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the guarantee.
Rebates and Allowances  We participate in various vendor rebate and allowance
arrangements as a manager of hotel properties. There are three types of programs that are common in the hotel industry that are sometimes referred to as rebates or allowances, including unrestricted rebates, marketing
restricted rebates and sponsorships. The primary business purpose of these arrangements is to secure favorable pricing for our hotel owners for various products and services or enhance resources for promotional campaigns co-sponsored by certain
vendors. More specifically, unrestricted rebates are funds returned to the buyer, generally based upon volumes or quantities of goods purchased. Marketing restricted allowances are funds allocated by vendor agreements for certain marketing or
other joint promotional initiatives. Sponsorships are funds paid by vendors, generally used by the vendor to gain exposure at meetings and events, which are accounted for as a reduction of the cost of the event.  We account for rebates and allowances as adjustments of the
prices of the vendors products and services. We show vendor costs and the reimbursement of those costs as reimbursed costs and cost reimbursements revenue, respectively; therefore, rebates are reflected as a reduction of these line items.
Cash and Equivalents  We consider all highly liquid investments with an initial
maturity of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash equivalents.  Restricted Cash  Restricted cash, totaling $126 million and $105 million at year-end 2005 and year-end 2004, respectively, is recorded in other long-term assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Restricted cash primarily consists of deposits
received on timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales that are held in escrow until the contract is closed.  Assets Held for Sale  We consider properties to be assets held for sale when all of the following criteria are met:  management commits to a plan to sell a property;  it is unlikely that the disposal plan will be significantly modified or discontinued;  the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition;  actions required to complete the sale of the property have been initiated;  sale of the property is probable and we expect the completed sale will occur within one year; and  the property is actively being marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable given its current market value.  Upon designation as an asset held for sale, we record the
carrying value of each property at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell, and we stop recording depreciation expense.  Loan Loss Reserves  We measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective
interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows or the
estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. For loans that we have determined to be impaired, we recognize
interest income on a cash basis. 
66 Table of Contents
Valuation of Goodwill  We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the
year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow
projections. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value.  Investments  Except as otherwise required by FIN 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, we consolidate entities that we
control. We account for investments in joint ventures using the equity method of accounting when we exercise significant influence over the venture. If we do not exercise significant influence, we account for the investment using the cost method of
accounting. We account for investments in limited partnerships and limited liability companies using the equity method of accounting when we own more than a minimal investment. Our ownership interest in these equity method investments varies
generally from 10 percent to 50 percent.  The
fair value of our available-for-sale securities totaled $53 million at year-end 2005. Gains in accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with our available-for-sale securities totaled $8 million at year-end 2005. At year-end 2005 there were no
losses in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with our available-for-sale securities.  Costs Incurred to Sell Real Estate Projects  We capitalize direct costs incurred to sell real estate projects attributable to and recoverable from the sales of timeshare interests
until the sales are recognized. Costs eligible for capitalization follow the guidelines of FAS No67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects. Selling and marketing costs capitalized under this
approach were approximately $92 million and $89 million at year-end 2005 and year-end 2004, respectively, and are included in property and equipment in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. If a contract is canceled, we charge unrecoverable
direct selling and marketing costs to expense and record deposits forfeited as income.  Residual Interests  We periodically sell notes receivable originated by our timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership products. We retain servicing assets and other interests in
the assets transferred to entities that are accounted for as residual interests. We treat the residual interests, excluding servicing assets, as trading securities under the provisions of FAS No115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. At the end of each reporting period, we estimate the fair value of the residual interests, excluding servicing assets, using a discounted cash flow model. We report changes in the fair values of these
residual interests, excluding servicing assets, through the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income. Servicing assets are classified as held to maturity under the provisions of FAS No115 and are recorded at amortized cost. 
Derivative Instruments  We use derivative instruments as part of our overall
strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.  We record all derivatives at fair value either as assets or
liabilities. We recognize, currently in earnings, changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and of derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments. Changes in the fair value of the hedged item in a fair
value hedge are recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognized in earnings in the same income statement line item as the change in the fair value of the derivative.  We record the effective portion of changes in fair value of
derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments as a component of other comprehensive income and report the ineffective portion currently in earnings. We reclassify amounts included in other comprehensive income into earnings in the same
period during which the hedged item affects earnings.  Foreign Operations  The U.S.
dollar is the functional currency of our consolidated and unconsolidated entities operating in the United States. The functional currency for our consolidated and unconsolidated entities operating outside of the United States is generally the
currency of the country in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. For consolidated entities whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars, and we do the same, as needed,

U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial
statement date, and income statement accounts are translated using the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Translation adjustments from foreign exchange and the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions of a long-term
investment nature are included as a separate component of shareholders equity. We report gains and losses from foreign exchange rate changes related to intercompany receivables and payables that are not of a long-term investment nature, as
well as gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, currently in operating costs and expenses, and those amounted to a $5 million loss in 2005, a $3 million loss in 2004, and a $7 million gain in 2003.  New Accounting Standards  In December 2004, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants issued Statement of Position 04-2, Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions, the SOP and the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB amended FAS No66, Accounting for
Sales of Real Estate, and FAS No67 Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects, to exclude accounting for real estate time-sharing transactions from these statements. The SOP is effective for
fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005.  Under the SOP, we will charge the majority of the costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred. We will also record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a
reduction of revenue at the time that we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We will also account for rental and other operations during holding periods as incidental operations, which require us to record any excess profits as a reduction of
inventory costs.  We estimate that the initial
adoption of the SOP in our 2006 first quarter, which we will report as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our fiscal year 2006 financial statements, will result in a one-time non-cash after-tax charge of approximately $110
million to $115 million, consisting primarily of the write-off of deferred selling costs and establishing the required reserves on notes. We estimate the ongoing impact of the adoption in subsequent periods will be immaterial.  In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS No123 revised
2004, Share-Based Payment FAS No123R, which is a revision of FAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. FAS No123R supersedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and amends FAS No95, Statement of Cash Flows. We will adopt FAS No123R at the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year. We estimate the adoption of FAS No123R, using the modified prospective
method, will result in incremental pre-tax expense in fiscal year 2006 of approximately $44 million, based on our current share-based payment compensation plans, assumptions reflecting currently available information and recent interpretations
related to accounting for share-based awards granted to eligible retirees.  Share-based Compensation  We have several share-based employee compensation plans that we account for using the intrinsic value method under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No25. Accordingly, we do not reflect
share-based employee compensation cost in net income for our Stock Option Program or the Supplemental Executive Stock Option awards. We recognized stock-based employee compensation cost of $40 million, $31 million and $19 million, net of tax, for
deferred share grants, restricted share grants and restricted stock units for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Shares issued to eligible retirees are fully vested at the grant date although they are delivered over a future period. Our policy is to
recognize compensation expense over the share delivery period unless the employee terminates his or her employment, in which case the remaining compensation expense is recognized at the date of termination.  Upon adoption of FAS No. 123R, compensation expense will be
recognized at the date the shares are fully vested. Table of Contents
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as if we
had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FAS No123 to share-based employee compensation. We have included the impact of measured but unrecognized compensation cost and excess tax benefits credited to additional paid-in-capital in
the calculation of the diluted pro forma shares for all years presented. In addition, we have included the estimated impact of reimbursements from third parties.  $ in millions, except per share amounts

SYNTHETIC FUEL  Operations  Our synthetic fuel operation currently consists of our interest in four coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities the
Facilities, two of which are located at a coal mine in Saline County, Illinois, and two of which are located at a coal mine in Jefferson County, Alabama. We plan to relocate one of the Alabama Facilities to a coal mine near Evansville,
Indiana, over the next 90 days and expect the Facility to be fully operational by May 2006. Production at this Facility will be suspended during the duration of the dismantling, transportation and reassembly process. Three of the four plants are
held in one entity, Synthetic American Fuel Enterprises II, LLC SAFE II, and one of the plants is held in a separate entity, Synthetic American Fuel Enterprises I, LLC SAFE I. Section29 of the Internal Revenue Code
redesignated as Section45K for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 Section 29 provides tax credits for the production and sale of synthetic fuels produced from coal through 2007 credits are not available for fuel produced after 2007.
Although the Facilities incur significant losses, these losses are more than offset by the tax credits generated under Section29, which reduce our income tax expense.  At both the Alabama and Illinois locations, the synthetic fuel operation has long-term site leases at sites
that are adjacent to large underground mines as well as barge load-out facilities on navigable rivers. In addition, with respect to the Alabama and Illinois locations, the synthetic fuel operation has long-term coal purchase agreements with the
owners of the adjacent coal mines and long-term synthetic fuel sales contracts with a number of major utilities, including the Tennessee Valley Authority and Alabama Power Company. These contracts ensure that the operation has long-term agreements
to purchase coal and sell synthetic fuel through 2007, covering approximately 80 percent of the productive capacity of the Facilities at those locations. From time to time, the synthetic fuel operation supplements these base contracts, as
opportunities arise, by entering into spot contracts to buy coal from these or other coal mines and sell synthetic fuel to these or different end users. We expect to negotiate similar site lease, coal purchase and synthetic fuel sales contracts for
the Indiana site. The long-term contracts can generally be canceled by us in the event that we choose not to operate the Facilities or that the synthetic fuel produced at the Facilities does not qualify for tax credits under Section29.
Although we anticipate that the coal mines
adjacent to the synthetic fuel operations production sites will be able to fulfill the Facilities requirements for feedstock coal, if our feedstock suppliers become unable to supply the Facilities with enough coal to satisfy our
requirements for any reason, we would have to curtail production, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations, or negotiate new coal supply agreements with third parties, which might not be available on similar terms. In
addition, the synthetic fuel operation has synthetic fuel sale contracts with approximately a dozen customers, a number of whom have contracted to purchase in excess of 10 percent of the productive capacity at our Alabama and Illinois locations.
Although we expect that those customers could be replaced by other purchasers, we cannot assure that we would be able to enter into replacement contracts on equivalent terms. As a result, the failure by one or more of those customers to perform
their purchase obligations under those sale contracts could have a material adverse effect on the synthetic fuel operation. 
69 Table of Contents
The synthetic fuel operation has a long-term operations and maintenance agreement with an
experienced manager of synthetic fuel facilities. This manager is responsible for staffing the Facilities, operating and maintaining the machinery and conducting routine maintenance on behalf of the synthetic fuel operation.  Finally, the synthetic fuel operation has a long-term
license and binder purchase agreement with Headwaters Incorporated, which permits the operation to utilize a carboxylated polystyrene copolymer emulsion patented by Headwaters and manufactured by Dow Chemical that is mixed with coal to produce a
qualified synthetic fuel.  As discussed in
greater detail below in Footnote 17, Contingencies, under the heading Synthetic Fuel, the tax credits available under Section29 for the production and sale of synthetic fuel in any given year are phased out if oil
prices in that year are above certain thresholds. As a result of high oil prices in the first several weeks of 2006, the synthetic fuel operation elected to suspend production of synthetic fuel in mid-January 2006. On February 17, 2006, we restarted
production and have taken steps to minimize operating losses that could occur if more than a majority of the tax credits are phased out in 2006 as a result of high oil prices. We will continue to monitor the situation, and if circumstances warrant,
we may again elect to suspend production in the future.  Our
Investment  We acquired our initial
interest in SAFE I and SAFE II from PacifiCorp Financial Services PacifiCorp in October 2001 for $46 million in cash, and we began operating the Facilities in the first quarter of 2002. We also make annual payments to PacifiCorp based
on the amount of tax credits produced, up to a certain threshold. On June21, 2003, we sold an approximately 50 percent ownership interest in both SAFE I and SAFE II. We received cash and promissory notes totaling $25 million at closing, and we
receive additional proceeds based on the actual amount of tax credits allocated to the purchaser.  As a result of a put option associated with the June21, 2003 sale of a 50 percent ownership interest, we consolidated the two
synthetic fuel joint ventures from that date through November6, 2003. Effective November7, 2003, because the put option was voided, we began accounting for the synthetic fuel joint ventures using the equity method of accounting.
Beginning March26, 2004, as a result of adopting FIN 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, we have again consolidated the synthetic fuel joint ventures, and we reflect our partners share of the operating losses
as minority interest.  On October6,
2004, we entered into amendment agreements with our synthetic fuel partner that resulted in a shift in the allocation of tax credits between us. Our partner increased its allocation of tax credits generated by the SAFE I synthetic fuel facility from
approximately 50 percent to 90 percent through March31, 2005, and paid a higher price per tax credit to us for that additional share of tax credits. Effective April1, 2005, our partners share of the tax credits from SAFE I returned
to approximately 50 percent. Also on October6, 2004, our partner reduced its allocation of tax credits generated by the three SAFE II synthetic fuel facilities from approximately 50 percent to roughly 8 percent through December31, 2004
and to 1 percent from January1, 2005 through May31, 2005. Effective June1, 2005, our partners share of the tax credits from the SAFE II facilities returned to approximately 50 percent.  In the 2005 third quarter, we entered into another amendment
agreement with our synthetic fuel partner that gave our partner the right to have its approximately 50 percent ownership interest in SAFE II redeemed on November30, 2005, or December31, 2005. Our partner exercised the option to have its
interest in SAFE II redeemed effective on December31, 2005, subsequent to our 2005 fiscal year-end. As a result, we now own all of the interests in SAFE II. In consideration for the redeemed interest, we forgave the remaining outstanding
promissory note balance of approximately $8 million related to our partners initial purchase of the interest in SAFE II and our partner was relieved of the obligation to make further earn-out payments with respect to SAFE II for periods after
December31, 2005. On that date, we eliminated our partners minority interest in SAFE II which was $7 million.  As a result of the redemption of our partners interest in SAFE II, with respect to the period beginning January1, 2006, we
will be allocated 100 percent of the operating losses associated with the Facilities owned by SAFE II, we will receive 100 percent of the tax credits generated by those Facilities, and production decisions with respect to those Facilities will be
made based on our 100 percent ownership.  Internal Revenue
Service Determinations  On
November7, 2003, the United States Internal Revenue Service IRS issued private letter rulings to the synthetic fuel joint ventures confirming that the synthetic fuel produced by the Facilities is a qualified fuel
under Section29 and that the resulting tax credit may be allocated among the members of the synthetic fuel joint ventures.  In July 2004, IRS field auditors issued a notice of proposed adjustment and later a Summary Report to PacifiCorp that included a challenge
to the placed-in-service dates of the three SAFE II synthetic fuel facilities. One of the conditions to qualify for tax credits under Section29 of the Internal Revenue Code is that the production facility 
70 Table of Contents
must have been placed in service before July1, 1998. On June7, 2005, the IRS National Office
issued a Technical Advice Memorandum confirming that the three SAFE II synthetic fuel facilities that were under IRS review met the placed-in-service requirement under Section29 of the Internal Revenue Code.  3.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  Senior Living Services  Late in 2002, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our senior living management business to Sunrise Senior Living, Inc.
Sunrise and to sell nine senior living communities to CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. CNL and recorded an after-tax charge of $131 million. We completed the sales to Sunrise and CNL, in addition to the related sale of a
parcel of land to Sunrise in March 2003, for $266 million. Late in 2002 we also purchased 14 senior living communities for approximately $15 million in cash, plus the assumption of $227 million in debt, from an unrelated owner. We had previously
agreed to provide a form of credit enhancement on the outstanding debt related to these communities. Management approved and committed to a plan to sell these communities within 12 months. As part of that plan, on March31, 2003, we acquired
all of the subordinated credit-enhanced mortgage securities relating to the 14 communities in a transaction in which we issued $46 million of unsecured Marriott International, Inc. notes, due April 2004. In the 2003 third quarter, we sold the 14
communities to CNL for approximately $184 million. We provided a $92 million acquisition loan to CNL in connection with the sale. Sunrise currently operates, and will continue to operate, the 14 communities under long-term management agreements. We
recorded after-tax gains of $19 million in 2003 in connection with these transactions, and we recorded after-tax income from operations of $7 million in 2003 associated with our discontinued senior living services business.  Distribution Services  In 2005 and 2004, we had income, net of tax, of $1 million
and $2 million, respectively, associated with the distribution services business we exited in 2002.  4.

related to foreign net operating losses increased as a result of additional losses that we believe may not be realized, partially offset by additional valuation allowance reversals.

We have made no provision for U.S. income taxes or additional foreign taxes on the
cumulative unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries $431 million as of year-end 2005 because we consider these earnings to be permanently invested. These earnings could become subject to additional taxes if remitted as dividends, loaned to us
or a U.S. affiliate or if we sold our interests in the affiliates. We cannot practically estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on the unremitted earnings. We conduct business in countries that grant a holiday from
income taxes fora 10 yearperiod.The holidaysexpire through 2014. The aggregate amount of taxes not incurred due to tax holidays is $56 million $024 per diluted share. On October22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act
the Jobs Act was signed into law. The Jobs Act included a special one-time dividends received deduction of 85 percent of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated to the United States, as defined in the Jobs Act. We reviewed the
effects of the repatriation provision in accordance with recently issued Treasury Department guidance, and decided not to repatriate any foreign earnings under the Jobs Act.  The provision for benefit from income taxes consists of:  $ in millions

current tax provision does not reflect the benefits attributable to us relating to the exercise of employee stock options of $87 million in 2005, $79 million in 2004 and $40 million in 2003. Included in the above amounts are tax credits of $172

and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets three to 40 years. Depreciation expense totaled $156 million in 2005, $133 million in 2004, and
$132 million in 2003. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the asset life or lease term.

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS  2005 Acquisitions  During the third quarter, we purchased from CTF Holdings Ltd. and certain of its affiliates collectively CTF 13 properties
in each case through a purchase of real estate, a purchase of the entity that owned the hotel, or an assignment of CTFs leasehold rights and certain joint venture interests from CTF for an aggregate price of $381 million. Prior to the sale,
all of the properties were operated by us or our subsidiaries.  We plan to sell eight of the properties we have purchased to date to third-party owners, and the balances related to these full-service properties are classified within the Assets held for sale and
Liabilities of assets held for sale captions in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. One operating lease has terminated. We operate the four remaining properties under leases, three of which expire by 2012. Under the purchase and sale
agreement we signed with CTF in the second quarter of 2005, we remain obligated to purchase two additional properties for $17 million, the acquisition of which was postponed pending receipt of certain third-party consents.  On the closing date we and CTF also modified management
agreements on 29 other CTF-leased hotels, 28 located in Europe and one located in the United States. We became secondarily liable for annual rent payments for certain of these hotels when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997. We
continue to manage 16 of these hotels under new long-term management agreements; however, due to certain provisions in the management agreements, we account for these contracts as operating leases. CTF placed approximately $89 million in trust
accounts to cover possible shortfalls in cash flow necessary to meet rent payments under these leases. In turn, we released CTF from their guarantees in connection with these leases. Approximately $79 million remained in these trust accounts at the
end of 2005. Our financial statements reflect us as lessee on these hotels. Minimum lease payments relating to these leases are as follows: $32 million in 2006; $33 million in 2007; $33 million in 2008; $33 million in 2009; $33 million in 2010; and
$231 million thereafter, for a total of $395 million.  For the remaining 13 European leased hotels, CTF may terminate management agreements with us if and when CTF obtains releases from landlords of our back-up guarantees. Pending completion of the CTF-landlord agreements, we continue to manage
these hotels under modified management agreements and remain secondarily liable under certain of these leases. CTF has made available 35 million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund under such guarantees. As CTF obtains
releases from the landlords and these hotels exit the system, our contingent liability exposure of approximately $217 million will decline.  We also continue to manage three hotels in the United Kingdom under amended management agreements with CTF and continue to manage 14
properties in Asia on behalf of New World Development Company Limited and its affiliates. CTFs principals are officers, directors and stockholders of New World Development Company Limited. At the closing date, the owners of the United Kingdom
and Asian hotels agreed to invest $17 million to renovate those properties.  We and CTF also exchanged legal releases effective as of the closing date, and litigation and arbitration that was outstanding between the two companies and their affiliates was dismissed.  Simultaneously with the closing on the foregoing
transactions, CTF also sold five properties and one minority joint venture interest to Sunstone Hotel Investors, Inc. Sunstone for $419 million, eight properties to Walton Street Capital, L.L.C. Walton Street for $578
million, and two properties to Tarsadia Hotels Tarsadia for $29 million, in each case as substitute purchasers under our purchase and sale agreement with CTF. Prior to consummation of the sales, we also operated all of these
properties. At closing, Walton Street and Sunstone entered into new long-term management agreements with us and agreed to invest a combined $68 million to further upgrade the 13 properties they acquired. The two properties purchased by Tarsadia are
being operated under short-term management and franchise agreements.  When we signed the purchase and sale agreement for the foregoing transactions in the 2005 second quarter, we recorded a $94 million pre-tax charge primarily due to the non-cash write-off of deferred contract
acquisition costs associated with the termination of the existing management agreements for properties involved in these transactions. As described above, we entered into new long-term management agreements with CTF, Walton Street and Sunstone at
the closing of the transactions, and we expect to sell most of the properties we acquired subject to long-term management agreements.  In 2005 we also purchased two full-service properties, one in Paris, France, and the other in Munich, Germany, for aggregate cash
consideration of $146 million. We plan to sell these two full-service properties to third-party owners, and the balances related to these properties are classified within the Assets held for sale and Liabilities of assets held for
sale line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

2005 Dispositions  Late in 2005, we contributed land underlying an additional nine Courtyard hotels, worth approximately $40
million, to CBM Land Joint Venture limited partnership CBM Land JV, a joint venture the majority of which is owned by Sarofim Realty Advisors Sarofim on behalf of an institutional investor, thereby obtaining a 23 percent
equity stake in CBM Land JV. At the same time we completed the sale of a portfolio of land underlying 75 Courtyard by Marriott hotels for approximately $246 million in cash to CBM Land JV. In conjunction with this transaction, we recognized a
pre-tax gain of $17 million in 2005, we deferred recognition of $5 million of pre-tax gain due to our minority interest in the joint venture, and we also deferred recognition of $40 million of pre-tax gain due to contingencies in the transaction
documents. As those contingencies expire in subsequent years, we will recognize additional gains.  We also sold a number of other land parcels in 2005 for $38 million in cash, net of transaction costs, and recognized pre-tax gains
totaling $6 million, and we sold two minority interests in joint ventures for $14 million in cash and recognized pre-tax gains totaling $7 million.  2004 Dispositions  We sold two lodging properties for $79 million in cash, net of transaction costs, recognized pre-tax gains totaling $6 million and
deferred recognition of gains totaling $1 million due to our continuing involvement with the two properties. None of the deferred gains were recognized in 2005. We accounted for both sales under the full accrual method in accordance with FAS
No66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, and will continue to operate the properties under long-term management agreements. We also sold 30 land parcels for $55 million in cash, net of transaction costs, and we recorded pre-tax
gains of $12 million.  Additionally, we sold
our Ramada International Hotels Resorts franchised brand, which consisted primarily of investments in franchise contracts and trademarks and licenses outside of the United States, to Cendant Corporations Hotel Group for $33 million
in cash, net of transaction costs, and recorded a pre-tax gain of $4 million.  Cendant exercised its option to redeem our interest in the Two Flags joint venture, and as a result Cendant acquired the trademarks and licenses for the Ramada and Days Inn lodging brands in the United States. We
recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $13 million in connection with this transaction. We also sold our interests in two joint ventures for $13 million in cash and recognized pre-tax gains of $6 million.  2003 Dispositions  We sold three lodging properties for $138 million in cash,
net of transaction costs. We accounted for the three property sales under the full accrual method in accordance with FAS No66, and we will continue to operate the properties under long-term management agreements. The buyer of one property
leased the property for a term of 20 years to a consolidated joint venture between the buyer and us. The lease payments are fixed for the first five years and variable thereafter. Our gain on the sale of $5 million will be recognized on a
straight-line basis in proportion to the gross rental charged to expense, and we recognized $1 million of pre-tax gains in each of 2003, 2004, and 2005. We recognized a $1 million gain in 2003 associated with the sale of the other two properties and
there are no remaining deferred gains. During the year, we also sold three parcels of land for $10 million in cash, net of transaction costs, and recognized a pre-tax loss of $1 million. Additionally, we sold our interests in three international
joint ventures for approximately $25 million and recorded pre-tax gains of approximately $21 million.  During the third quarter of 2003, we completed the sale of an approximately 50 percent interest in the synthetic fuel operation. We
received cash and promissory notes totaling $25 million at closing, and we are receiving additional proceeds based on the actual amount of tax credits allocated to the purchaser. See Footnote 2, Synthetic Fuel for further discussion.

MARRIOTT AND WHITBREAD JOINT VENTURE  During the 2005 second quarter we established a 50/50 joint venture with Whitbread PLC Whitbread to acquire Whitbreads
portfolio of 46 franchised Marriott and Renaissance hotels totaling over 8,000 rooms, and for us to take over management of the entire portfolio of hotels upon the transfer of the hotels to the new joint venture. Whitbread sold its interest in the
46 hotels to the joint venture for approximately 995 million. Whitbread received approximately 710 million in cash including 620 million from senior debt proceeds and 50 percent of the preferred and ordinary shares of the
joint venture and non-voting deferred consideration shares valued at 285 million. We contributed approximately 90 million $171 million in the second quarter of 2005 for the remaining 50 percent of the preferred and ordinary shares of
the joint venture. The joint venture is currently discussing the sale of the hotels with a potential purchaser. As the joint venture sells the hotels, our interest in the joint venture will be redeemed. The joint venture expects to sell properties
in early 2006 subject to long-term management agreements with us.  10.

totaling $28 million.  At year-end 2005, our
recorded investment in impaired loans was $184 million. We have a $103 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $81 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there is no related allowance for credit losses. At year-end 2004, our
recorded investment in impaired loans was $181 million. During 2005 and 2004, our average investment in impaired loans totaled $182 million and $161 million, respectively.  Gains from the sale of notes receivable totaled approximately $94 million, $69 million, and $64 million
during 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

ASSET SECURITIZATIONS  We periodically sell, with limited recourse, through special purpose entities, notes receivable originated by our timeshare business in
connection with the sale of timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership products. We continue to service the notes, and transfer all proceeds collected to special purpose entities. We retain servicing assets and other interests in the notes
which are accounted for as residual interests. The interests are limited to the present value of cash available after paying financing expenses and program fees, and absorbing credit losses. We have included gains from the sales of timeshare notes
receivable totaling $69 million in 2005 and $64 million in each of 2004 and 2003 in gains and other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income. We had residual interests of $196 million and $190 million, respectively, at year-end
2005 and year-end 2004 which are recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as other long-term receivables of $125 million and $127 million, respectively, and other current assets of $71 million and $63 million, respectively.
At the date of sale and at the end of each
reporting period, we estimate the fair value of residual interests, excluding servicing assets, using a discounted cash flow model. These transactions may utilize interest rate swaps to protect the net interest margin associated with the beneficial
interest. We report in income changes in the fair value of residual interests, excluding servicing assets, as they are considered trading securities under the provisions of FAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities. During 2005 and 2004, we recorded trading gains of $2 million and $3 million, respectively, and in 2003 we recorded trading losses of $7 million. We used the following key assumptions to measure the fair value of the
residual interests, excluding servicing assets, at the date of sale during 2005, 2004, and 2003: average discount rate of 856 percent, 780 percent and 495 percent, respectively; average expected annual prepayments, including defaults, of 2356
percent, 1861 percent and 1700 percent, respectively; expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, excluding prepayments and defaults, of 79 months, 83 months and 85 months, respectively; and expected weighted average life of
prepayable notes receivable, including prepayments and defaults, of 38 months, 42 months and 44 months, respectively. Our key assumptions are based on experience.  We used the following key assumptions in measuring the fair value of the residual interests, excluding
servicing assets, in our eight outstanding note sales at year-end 2005: an average discount rate of 868 percent; an average expected annual prepayment rate, including defaults, of 1919 percent; an expected weighted average life of prepayable notes
receivable, excluding prepayments and defaults, of 65 months; and an expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, including prepayments and defaults of 35 months.  At the date of sale, we measure servicing assets at their allocated previous carrying amount based on
relative fair value. Servicing assets are classified as held to maturity under the provisions of FAS No115 and are recorded at amortized cost.

Cash flows between us and third-party purchasers during 2005, 2004, and 2003, were as
follows: net proceeds to us from new timeshare note sales of $399 million, $312 million and $231 million, respectively; repurchases by us of defaulted loans over 150 days overdue of $23 million, $18 million and $19 million, respectively; servicing
fees received by us of $4 million, $4 million and $3 million, respectively; and cash flows received from our retained interests of $85 million, $90 million and $47 million, respectively.  At year-end 2005, $961 million of principal remains outstanding in all sales in which we have a retained
residual interest. Delinquencies of more than 90 days at year-end 2005, amounted to $5 million. Net of recoveries, we incurred no losses on defaulted loans that were resolved during 2005. We have been able to resell timeshare units underlying
defaulted loans without incurring material losses.  We have completed a stress test on the fair value of the residual interests with the objective of measuring the change in value associated with independent changes in individual key variables. The methodology used applied unfavorable
changes that would be considered statistically significant for the key variables of prepayment rate, discount rate and weighted average remaining term. The fair value of the residual interests was $196 million at year-end 2005, before any stress
test changes were applied. An increase of 100 basis points in the prepayment rate would decrease the year-end valuation by $3 million, or 17 percent, and an increase of 200 basis points in the prepayment rate would decrease the year-end valuation
by $7 million, or 34 percent. An increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate would decrease the year-end valuation by $4 million, or 21 percent, and an increase of 200 basis points in the discount rate would decrease the year-end valuation
by $8 million, or 41 percent. A decline of two months in the weighted-average remaining term would decrease the year-end valuation by $2 million, or 10 percent, and a decline of four months in the weighted-average remaining term would decrease the
year-end valuation by $4 million, or 20 percent.  12.
LONG-TERM DEBT  Our long-term debt at year-end 2005, and year-end 2004 consisted of the following:  $ in millions

year-end 2005, all debt, other than mortgage debt and $46 million of other debt, is unsecured.  We are party to a multicurrency revolving credit agreement that provides for aggregate borrowings of $2 billion expiring in 2010, which
supports our commercial paper program and letters of credit. This facility became effective on June6, 2005, replacing two multicurrency credit agreements in the same aggregate amount which would have otherwise expired in 2006. As with the
facilities it replaced, borrowings under this new facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus a spread based on our public debt rating. Additionally, we pay annual fees on the facility at a rate also based on
our public debt rating.  In the fourth quarter
of 2005 we began issuing short-term commercial paper in Europe in addition to our long-standing commercial paper program in the United States. Our United States and European commercial paper issuances are subject to the availability of the
commercial paper market, as we have no commitment from buyers to purchase our commercial paper. We reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is
not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. We classify commercial paper as long-term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long-term basis.  In June 2005, we sold $350 million aggregate principal
amount of 4625 percent Series F Notes due 2012 the Series F Notes. We received net proceeds of approximately $346 million from this offering, after deducting a 
78 Table of Contents
discount and underwriting fees, and we used these proceeds to repay commercial paper borrowings and for
general corporate purposes. Interest on the Series F Notes is payable on June15 and December15 of each year, commencing on December15, 2005. The Series F Notes will mature on June15, 2012, and we may redeem the notes, in
whole or in part, at any time or from time to time under the terms provided in the Form of Series F Note.  In November 2005, we offered to holders of our outstanding 7 percent Series E Notes due 2008 and to holders of our outstanding 7875
percent Series C Notes due 2009 collectively Old Notes an opportunity to exchange into new 581 percent Series G Notes the Series G Notes, and we issued new Series G Notes in the aggregate total of $427 million to replace
Old Notes that had been validly tendered for exchange and not withdrawn, comprised of $203 million of the Series E Notes and $224 million of the Series C Notes. In addition, we paid an exchange price of $31 million $9 million for the Series E Notes
and $22 million for the Series C Notes which was equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal on the Old Notes. Furthermore, holders who had Old Notes accepted for exchange received a cash
payment of $7 million representing accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the settlement date.  The exchanges are not considered to be extinguishments, and accordingly, the exchange price payment, along with the existing unamortized
discounts associated with the Series C Notes and Series E Notes, are being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the remaining term of the replacement debt instrument using the interest method. All other third-party costs related to
the exchange were expensed as incurred.  Interest on the Series G Notes is payable on May10 and November10 of each year, beginning on May10, 2006. The Series G Notes mature on November10, 2015, and we may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at any time
or from time to time under the terms provided in the Form of Series G Note.  Our Series C Notes, Series E Notes, Series F Notes, and Series G Notes were all issued under an indenture with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank, as trustee, dated as of
November16, 1998.  On December8,
2005, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC covering an indeterminate amount of future offerings of debt securities, common stock or preferred stock, either separately or represented by warrants, depositary
share, rights or purchase contracts.  We are
in compliance with covenants in our loan agreements, that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and minimum shareholders equity, and also include, among other things, limitations on additional indebtedness and the pledging of
assets.  Aggregate debt maturities are: 2006 56 million; 2007 - $16 million; 2008 - $107 million; 2009 - $93 million; 2010 - $17million and $1,448 million thereafter.  Cash paid for interest, net of amounts capitalized, was $87 million in 2005, $88 million in 2004 and $94 million in 2003.  13.
SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY  Eight hundred million shares of our ClassA Common Stock, with a par value of $01 per share, are authorized, and ten million shares
of preferred stock, without par value, are authorized. As of the 2005 fiscal year-end, there were 2059million shares of our ClassA Common Stock outstanding and no shares of our preferred stock were outstanding.  On March27, 1998, our Board of Directors adopted a
shareholder rights plan under which one preferred stock purchase right was distributed for each share of our ClassA Common Stock. Each right entitles the holder to buy 1/1000th of a share of a newly issued series of junior participating preferred stock of the Company at an exercise price of $175. The rights may not presently be
exercised, but will be exercisable 10 days after a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 20 percent or more of our ClassA Common Stock or begins a tender or exchange for 30 percent or more of our ClassA Common Stock. Shares
owned by a person or group on March27, 1998, and held continuously thereafter, are exempt for purposes of determining beneficial ownership under the rights plan. The rights are nonvoting and will expire on the tenth anniversary of the adoption
of the shareholder rights plan unless previously exercised or redeemed by us for $01 each. If we are involved in a merger or certain other business combinations not approved by the Board of Directors, each right entitles its holder, other than the
acquiring person or group, to purchase common stock of either the Company or the acquirer having a value of twice the exercise price of the right.

Our accumulated other comprehensive loss of $11 million and our accumulated other
comprehensive income of $9 million, respectively, at year-end 2005 and year-end 2004 consist primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments.  14.
EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS  We issue stock options, deferred shares, restricted shares and restricted stock units under our 2002 Comprehensive Stock and Cash
Incentive Plan the Comprehensive Plan. Under the Comprehensive Plan, we may award to participating employees 1options to purchase our ClassA Common Stock Stock Option Program and Supplemental Executive Stock Option
awards, 2deferred shares of our ClassA Common Stock, 3restricted shares of our ClassA Common Stock, and 4restricted stock units of our ClassA Common Stock. In addition, in 2004 and 2003 we had an employee
stock purchase plan Stock Purchase Plan. In accordance with the provisions of Opinion No25 of the Accounting Principles Board, we recognize no compensation cost for the Stock Option Program, the Supplemental Executive Stock Option awards or
the Stock Purchase Plan. We recognize compensation cost for the restricted stock, deferred shares and restricted stock unit awards. In August 2005 the Board of Directors amended the Comprehensive Plan to provide participants the ability during a
limited timeframe in 2005 to elect to accelerate the schedule for distribution of certain vested deferred shares. The amendment does not alter the previously established vesting schedule. We expect to issue 33million shares under the program
in the first quarter of 2006.  Deferred shares
granted to directors, officers and key employees under the Comprehensive Plan generally vest over 5 to 10 years in annual installments commencing one year after the date of grant. We granted seven thousand deferred shares during 2005. Compensation
cost, net of tax, recognized during 2005, 2004, and 2003 was $4 million in each of 2005 and 2004, and $7 million in 2003. At year-end 2005, there was approximately $8 million in deferred compensation related to deferred shares.  We issue restricted shares under the Comprehensive Plan to
officers and key employees and distribute those restricted shares over a number of years in annual installments, subject to certain prescribed conditions, including continued employment. We recognize compensation expense for the restricted shares
over the restriction period equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of issuance. We awarded no restricted shares under this plan during 2005. We recognized compensation cost, net of tax, of $3 million in 2005, $4 million in 2004,
and $4 million in 2003. At year-end 2005, there was approximately $6 million in deferred compensation related to restricted shares.  We issue restricted stock units under the Comprehensive Plan to certain officers and key employees and those units vest over four years in
annual installments commencing one year after the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for the fair market value of the shares over the vesting period. Included in the 2005 and 2004 compensation costs are $34 million and $23 million,
respectively, net of tax, related to the grant of approximately 15million units and 16million units, respectively, under the restricted stock unit plan, which was started in the first quarter of 2003. At year-end 2005, there was
approximately $123 million in deferred compensation related to unit grants. Under the unit plan, fixed grants will be awarded annually to certain employees.  Under the Stock Purchase Plan in 2004 and 2003, eligible employees were able to purchase our ClassA Common Stock through payroll
deductions at the lower of the market value at the beginning or end of each plan year. We did not offer the Stock Purchase Plan in 2005. The plan was discontinued in 2005.  Employee stock options may be granted to officers and key employees at exercise prices equal to the market
price of our ClassA Common Stock on the date of grant. Nonqualified options expire 10 years after the date of grant, except those issued from 1990 through 2000, which expire 15 years after the date of the grant. Most options under the Stock
Option Program are exercisable in cumulative installments of one quarter at the end of each of the first four years following the date of grant. In February 1997, 22million Supplemental Executive Stock Option awards were awarded to certain of
our officers. The options vested in 2005. Six hundred thousand of these options, which have an exercise price of $25, have been exercised and 02million options have been cancelled. At year-end 2005 14million options remained
outstanding.

For the purposes of the disclosures required by FAS No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, the fair value of each option granted during 2005, 2004, and 2003 was $26, $17, and $11, respectively. In 2004 and 2003, we estimated the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing method. In 2005 we used a binomial method to estimate the fair value of each option granted. The assumptions for all years are noted in the following table:  2005 2004 2003 Annual dividends 036 032 030 Expected volatility 30 31 32 Risk-free interest rate 41 37 35 Expected life in years 8 7 7

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  We believe that the fair values of current assets and current liabilities approximate their reported carrying amounts. The fair values of
non-current financial assets, liabilities and derivatives are shown in the following table.  2005

value notes and other receivables based on the expected future cash flows discounted at risk-adjusted rates. We determine valuations for long-term debt and other long-term liabilities based on quoted market prices or expected future payments
discounted at risk-adjusted rates.  16.
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  During 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of
interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating rate. The aggregate notional amount of the swap is $92 million and it matures in 2010. The swap is classified as a
fair value hedge under FAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities FAS No133, and the change in the fair value of the swap, as well as the change in the fair value of the underlying
note receivable, is recognized in interest income. The fair value of the swap was a $1 million asset at year-end 2005, and a $3 million liability at year-end 2004. The hedge is highly effective, and therefore, no net gain or loss was reported during
2005, 2004, and 2003.  During 2005, we entered
into two interest rate swap agreements to manage the volatility of the U.S. Treasury component of the interest rate risk associated with the forecasted issuance our Series F Senior Notes and the exchange of our Series C and E Senior Notes for new
Series G Senior Notes. Both swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under FAS No133 and were terminated upon pricing of the notes. Both swaps were highly effective in offsetting fluctuations in the U.S. Treasury component. Thus, there was
no net gain or loss reported in earnings during 2005. The total amount for these swaps was recorded in other comprehensive income and was a net loss of $2 million during 2005, which will be amortized to interest expense using the interest method
over the life of the notes.  At year-end 2005,
we had six outstanding interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our timeshare note sales. Historically, we were required by purchasers and/or rating agencies to
utilize interest rate swaps to protect the excess spread within our sold note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps is $380 million, and they expire through 2022. These swaps are not accounted for as hedges under FAS No133. The
fair value of the swaps is a net asset of $5 million at year-end 2005, and a net asset of approximately $3 million at year-end 2004. We recorded a $2 million net gain during 2005 and 2004, and a $3 million net gain during 2003.  During 2005, 2004, and 2003, we entered into interest rate
swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with forecasted timeshare note sales. During 2005, one swap was designated as a cash flow hedge under FAS No133 and was highly effective in offsetting interest rate fluctuations. The amount of the
ineffectiveness is immaterial. The second swap entered into in 2005 did not qualify for hedge accounting. The non-qualifying swaps resulted in a loss of $3 million during 2005, a gain of $2 million during 2004 and a loss of $4 million during 2003.
These amounts are included in the gains from the sales of timeshare notes receivable.  During 2005, 2004, and 2003, we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain
monetary assets. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amount of the contracts is $544 million at year-end 2005. The forward exchange contracts do not qualify as hedges in accordance with FAS No133. The fair value of the forward
contracts is a liability of $2 million at year-end 2005 and zero at year-end 2004. We recorded a $26 million gain during 2005 and a $3 million and $2 million net loss during 2004 and 2003, respectively, relating to these forward foreign exchange
contracts. The net gains and losses for all years were offset by income and losses recorded from translating the related monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. 
82 Table of Contents
During 2005, 2004, and 2003, we entered into foreign exchange option and forward
contracts to hedge the potential volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with variations in foreign exchange rates. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the contracts is $27 million at year-end 2005. These contracts
have terms of less than one year and are classified as cash flow hedges. Changes in their fair values are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The fair value of the option contracts is approximately zero at year-end 2005 and 2004.
During 2004, it was determined that certain derivatives were no longer effective in offsetting the hedged item. Thus, cash flow hedge accounting treatment was discontinued and the ineffective contracts resulted in a loss of $1 million, which was
reported in earnings for 2004. The remaining hedges were highly effective and there was no net gain or loss reported in earnings for 2005, 2004, and 2003. As of year-end 2005, there were no deferred gains or losses on existing contracts accumulated
in other comprehensive income that we expect to reclassify into earnings over the next year.  During 2005, we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency exchange rate volatility associated with certain
investments in foreign operations. One contract was designated as a hedge in the net investment of a foreign operation under FAS No133. The hedge was highly effective and resulted in a $1 million net loss in the cumulative translation
adjustment at year-end 2005. Certain contracts did not qualify as hedges under FAS No133 and resulted in a gain of $3 million for 2005. The contracts offset the losses associated with translation adjustments for various investments in foreign
operations. The contracts have an aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of $229 million and a fair value of approximately zero at year-end 2005.  17.
CONTINGENCIES  Guarantees  We issue guarantees to certain lenders and hotel owners primarily to obtain long-term management contracts. The guarantees generally have
a stated maximum amount of funding and a term of five years or less. The terms of guarantees to lenders generally require us to fund if cash flows from hotel operations are inadequate to cover annual debt service or to repay the loan at the end of
the term. The terms of the guarantees to hotel owners generally require us to fund if the hotels do not attain specified levels of operating profit. We can generally recover guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel owners as loans which are generally
repayable to us out of future hotel cash flows and/or proceeds from the sale of hotels. We also enter into project completion guarantees with certain lenders in conjunction with hotels and timeshare units that we or our joint venture partners are
building.  The maximum potential amount of
future fundings for guarantees where we are the primary obligor and the carrying amount of the liability for expected future fundings at year-end 2005, are as follows:  $ in millions Guarantee Type

guarantees of $414 million listed above include $69 million for guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying hotels open and we begin to operate the properties. Guarantees not in effect are comprised of $13 million of debt service
profit guarantees and $56 million of operating profit guarantees.  In addition to the guarantees noted above, in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications
to the lender for loss, liability or damage occurring as a result of the actions of the other joint venture owner or our own actions.  The guarantees of $414 million in the table above also do not include $320 million of guarantees related to Senior Living Services lease
obligations and lifecare bonds for which we are secondarily liable. Sunrise is the primary obligor of the leases and a portion of the lifecare bonds, and CNL is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to the sale of the
Senior Living Services business in 2003, these pre-existing guarantees were guarantees by the Company of obligations of consolidated Senior Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called
on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. We do not expect to fund under the guarantees.

Additionally, the guarantees of $414 million in the table above do not include lease
obligations for which we became secondarily liable when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997, consisting of annual rent payments of approximately $20 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term plus available
extensions of approximately $217 million. We are also secondarily obligated for real estate taxes and other charges associated with the leases. CTF has made available 35 million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund
under such guarantees. As CTF obtains releases from the landlords and these hotels exit the system, our contingent liability exposure of approximately $217 million will decline. Since we assumed these guarantees, we have not funded any amounts, and
we do not expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future.  Commitments and Letters of Credit  In addition to the guarantees noted above, as of year-end 2005, we had extended approximately $11 million of loan commitments to owners of lodging properties, under which we expect to fund approximately $5 million by
year-end 2006. We do not expect to fund the remaining $6 million of commitments, which expire as follows: $4 million within one year; and $2 million after five years. At year-end 2005, we also have commitments to invest up to $27 million of equity
for minority interests in partnerships that plan to purchase both full-service and select-service hotels.  In 2005, we assigned to a third-party our previous commitment to fund up to $129 million to the Courtyard joint venture for the primary
purpose of funding the costs of renovating its properties in 2005 and 2006. Under the agreement the third-party assumed the lending obligation to the venture. As of year-end 2005, we funded $1 million and the third-party funded $22 million under
this loan commitment. The commitment to fund is reduced to $27 million in September 2006 and expires in December 2009. In total, we expect that no more than $104 million of the $129 million commitment will be funded, and other than the $1 million we
already funded, we expect the third-party to provide all future fundings. We do not anticipate making further fundings ourselves, but remain secondarily obligated to the Courtyard joint venture if the third-party fails to fund. At year-end 2005,
that secondary obligation totaled $106 million.  At year-end 2005, we also had $93 million of letters of credit outstanding on our behalf, the majority of which related to our self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued on our behalf at year-end 2005, totaled $546 million, the majority
of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our timeshare and lodging operations and self-insurance programs.  Synthetic Fuel  The tax credits available under the Internal Revenue Code for the production and sale of synthetic fuels were established by Congress to
encourage the development of alternative domestic energy sources. Congress deemed that the incentives provided by the tax credits would not be necessary if the price of oil increased beyond certain thresholds as prices would then provide a more
natural market for these alternative fuels. As a result, the tax credits available under the Internal Revenue Code for the production and sale of synthetic fuel in any given calendar year are phased out if the Reference Price of a barrel of oil for
that year falls within a specified range. The Reference Price of a barrel of oil is an estimate of the annual average wellhead price per barrel of domestic crude oil and is determined for each calendar year by the Secretary of the Treasury by
April1 of the following year. In 2003 and 2004, the Reference Price was roughly equal to 89 percent of the average price in those years of the benchmark NYMEX futures contract for a barrel of light, sweet crude oil. The price range within
which the credit is phased out was set in 1980 and is adjusted annually for inflation. In 2004, the Reference Price phase-out range was $5135 to $6447. Because the Reference Price of a barrel of oil for 2004 was below that range, at $3675, there
was no reduction of the tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2004. Assuming a 2 percent inflation adjustment factor for 2005 and assuming that the ratio of the Reference Price to the average wellhead price of the benchmark
NYMEX futures contract remains approximately the same in 2005 as it was in 2004, we currently estimate that, because the average NYMEX price for January through December 2005 was approximately $5671, there was no reduction of the tax credits
available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2005.  We cannot predict with any accuracy the future price of a barrel of oil. If the Reference Price of a barrel of oil in 2006 or 2007 exceeds the applicable phase-out threshold for those years, the tax credits generated
by our synthetic fuel facilities in those years could be reduced or eliminated, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. As a result of the high oil prices in the first several weeks of 2006, the synthetic fuel operation
elected to suspend production of synthetic fuel in mid-January 2006. On February17, 2006 we restarted production and have taken steps to minimize operating losses that could occur if more than a majority of the tax credits are phased out in
2006 as a result of high oil prices. We will continue to monitor the situation, and if circumstances warrant, we may again elect to suspend production in the future.

See Footnote 2, Synthetic Fuel, earlier in this report, for additional
information related to the synthetic fuel operations.  Investment in Leveraged Lease  At year-end 2005, we have a $23 million gross investment in an aircraft leveraged lease with Delta Air Lines, Inc. Delta which we acquired in 1994. The gross investment is comprised of rentals receivable and the residual value
of the aircraft offset by unearned income. On September14, 2005, Delta filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and informed us that it wishes to restructure the lease. As a result, we believe our investment
is impaired, and have recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $17 million in 2005, leaving a net exposure of $6 million.  18.

Thereafter 873 Total minimum lease payments where we are the primary obligor 1,483  Most
leases have initial terms of up to 20 years and contain one or more renewal options, generally for five- or 10-year periods. These leases provide for minimum rentals and additional rentals based on our operations of the leased property. The total
minimum lease payments above include $432 million, representing obligations of consolidated subsidiaries that are non-recourse to Marriott International, Inc. 
As discussed in Footnote 7, we became secondarily liable for annual rent payments for certain of these hotels when we acquired the
Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997. We continue to manage 16 of these hotels under new long-term management agreements; however, due to certain provisions in the management agreements, we account for these contracts as operating leases. CTF has
placed approximately $89 million in trust accounts to cover possible shortfalls in cash flow necessary to meet rent payments under these leases. In turn, we released CTF affiliates from their guarantees in connection with these leases. Approximately
$79 million remained in these trust accounts at the end of 2005. Minimum lease payments relating to these leases, which are not reflected in the $1,483 million above, are as follows: $32 million in 2006, $33 million in 2007, $33 million in 2008, $33
million in 2009, $33 million in 2010, and $231 million thereafter, for a total of $395 million.  Rent expense consists of:  $ in millions

BUSINESS SEGMENTS  We are a diversified hospitality company with operations in five business segments:  Full-Service Lodging, which includes Marriott Hotels Resorts, The Ritz-Carlton, Renaissance Hotels Resorts and Bulgari Hotels Resorts;
Select-Service Lodging, which includes Courtyard, Fairfield Inn and SpringHill Suites;  Extended-Stay Lodging, which includes Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, Marriott ExecuStay and Marriott Executive Apartments;  Timeshare, which includes the development, marketing, operation and ownership of timeshare properties under the Marriott Vacation Club International, The Ritz-Carlton Club,
Marriott Grand Residence Club and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club brands; and  Synthetic Fuel, which includes our interest in the operation of coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities.  In addition to the segments above, in 2002 we announced our
intent to sell, and subsequently did sell, our Senior Living Services business segment and exited our Distribution Services business segment.  We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest
income, provision for loan losses and interest expense. With the exception of the Synthetic Fuel segment, we do not allocate income taxes to our segments. As timeshare note sales are an integral part of the timeshare business we include timeshare
note sale gains in our Timeshare segment results, and we allocate other gains as well as equity in earnings losses from our joint ventures and divisional general, administrative and other expenses to each of our segments. Unallocated corporate
expenses represent that portion of our general, administrative and other expenses and equity in earnings losses that are not allocable to our segments.  We have aggregated the brands and businesses presented within each of our segments considering their similar economic characteristics,
types of customers, distribution channels and the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment.  Revenues  $ in millions

assets of $767 million in 2005, $358 million in 2004 and $336 million in 2003. No individual country, other than the United States, constitutes a material portion of our revenues, financial results or fixed assets.  20.
VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES  FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities the Interpretation, was effective for all enterprises with
variable interests in variable interest entities created after January31, 2003. FIN 46R, which was revised in December 2003, was effective for all entities to which the provisions of FIN 46 were not applied as of December24, 2003. We
applied the provisions of FIN 46R to all entities subject to the Interpretation as of March26, 2004. Under FIN 46R, if an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity, it must be consolidated by the enterprise that absorbs the
majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both, the primary beneficiary.  As a result of adopting FIN 46R, we consolidated our two synthetic fuel joint ventures as of
March26, 2004. At year-end 2005, the ventures had working capital of $25 million, and the book value of the synthetic fuel facilities was $19 million. The ventures have no long-term debt. See Footnote 2, Synthetic Fuel, of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosure related to our synthetic fuel operation, including the nature, purpose and size of the two synthetic fuel joint ventures, as well as the nature of our involvement and the timing of
when our involvement began. 
88 Table of Contents
We currently consolidate four other entities that are variable interest entities under
FIN 46R. These entities were established with the same partner to lease four Marriott-branded hotels. The combined capital in the four variable interest entities is $3 million, which is used primarily to fund hotel working capital. Our equity at
risk is $2 million, and we hold 55 percent of the common equity shares.  We have one other significant interest in an entity that is a variable interest entity under FIN 46R. In February 2001, we entered into a shareholders agreement with an unrelated third party to form a joint
venture to own and lease luxury hotels to be managed by us. In February 2002, the joint venture signed its first lease with a third-party landlord. We hold 35 percent of the equity and 65 percent of the debt. In addition, each equity partner entered
into various guarantees with the landlord to guarantee lease payments. Our maximum exposure to loss is $15 million. We do not consolidate the joint venture since we do not bear the majority of the expected losses or expected residual returns.
In conjunction with the transaction with CTF
described more fully in Footnote 7, Acquisitions and Dispositions, under the caption 2005 Acquisitions we manage 15 hotels on behalf of four tenant entities 100 percent owned by CTF, which lease the 15 hotels from third-party
owners. The entities have minimal equity and minimal assets comprised of hotel working capital. CTF has placed money in a trust account to cover cash flow shortfalls and to meet rent payments. At year-end 2005, the trust account held approximately
$51 million. The entities are variable interest entities under FIN 46R. We do not consolidate the entities as we do not bear the majority of the expected losses. We are liable for rent payments for nine of the 15 hotels in the event that there is
a cash flow shortfall and there is no money left in the trust. Future minimum lease payments through the end of the lease term for these nine hotels total approximately $143 million. In addition, we have guaranteed to CTF that we will fund rent
shortfalls for the remaining six hotels of up to $36 million.  We also manage one hotel on behalf of a tenant entity 100 percent owned by CTF, which leases the hotel from a third-party owner. The entity has minimal equity and minimal assets comprised of hotel working capital. CTF
has placed money in a trust account to cover cash flow shortfalls and to meet rent payments. At year-end 2005, there is approximately $28 million in the trust. The entity is a variable interest entity under FIN 46R. We consolidate the entity as we
bear the majority of the expected losses. We are liable for rent payments for this hotel in the event that there is a cash flow shortfall and there is not money left in the trust. Future minimum lease payments through the end of the lease term total
$216 million.  As described in Footnote 9,
Marriott and Whitbread Joint Venture, in the 2005 second quarter we formed a joint venture with Whitbread for the purpose of acquiring a portfolio of 46 hotels from Whitbread to be managed by us. The joint venture is a variable interest
entity under FIN 46R. The purchase price of the portfolio was approximately 995 million. As of the end of our 2005 fourth quarter, our maximum exposure to loss from our investment in this joint venture is $161 million. We do not consolidate
the joint venture since we do not bear the majority of the expected losses or expected residual returns.

In
December 2000, we acquired 120 Courtyard by Marriott hotels through the Courtyard joint venture, an unconsolidated joint venture with an affiliate of Host Marriott, and we and Host Marriott owned equal shares in the joint venture. Prior to the
formation of the Courtyard joint venture, Host Marriott was a general partner in the unconsolidated partnerships that owned the 120 Courtyard by Marriott hotels. During the 2005 second quarter, Sarofim Realty Advisors, on behalf of an institutional
investor, completed the acquisition of a 75 percent interest in the Courtyard joint venture, and we signed new long-term management agreements with the joint venture. With the addition of the new equity, our interest in the joint venture has
declined to approximately 21 percent and Host Marriotts interest declined to less than 4 percent. As part of the completed transaction, our mezzanine loan to the joint venture including accrued interest totaling approximately $269 million
was repaid. The transaction has accelerated the pace of reinventions and upgrades at the joint ventures 120 hotels.

Part II.  Item5. Controls and Procedures.  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As of the
end of the period covered by this annual report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act, and management necessarily applied its judgment
in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding managements control objectives. You should note that the design of any system of controls is based in
part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Based upon the foregoing
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
See Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting included in Part II, Item8 Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
