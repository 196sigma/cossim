Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Computerized Thermal Imaging, Inc.
A Development Stage Company
Layton, Utah
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Computerized
Thermal Imaging, Inc. a development stage company as of June 30, 2000, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for the years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999 and from inception on June 10,
1987 through June 30, 2000. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Computerized Thermal Imaging, Inc. a development stage company as of June 30,
2000, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for
the years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999 and from inception on June 10, 1987
through June 30, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally

COMPUTERIZED THERMAL IMAGING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2001 AND 2000
1. SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
ORGANIZATION--Computerized Thermal Imaging, Inc. and Subsidiaries the
Company is a Nevada Corporation, involved in the development of a thermal
imaging system for applications in the health care industry. The Company
system is based upon computer interpretation of thermal photography using
proprietary software developed by the Company. The Company also applies elements
of its core thermal imaging technology to industrial non-destructive testing
applications. The Company is considered a development stage enterprise because
it has not yet generated significant revenues from the sale of its products.
Since inception, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts
to: 1 the development and improvement of systems for commercial application of
thermal imaging technology in the medical industry; 2 the development of
markets for its technology; and 3 the search for sources of capital to fund its
efforts. On April 18, 2000, the Company acquired 100 percent of the outstanding
common stock of Bales Scientific, Inc. Bales, a company that designs,
manufactures, and sells high-resolution, dynamic, digital infrared-imaging
workstations and related products for both medical and industrial applications
see Note 6.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION--The Company financial statements have been
presented on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The
Company is in the development stage and has been primarily involved in research
and development activities. This has resulted in significant operating losses
and an accumulated deficit at June 30, 2001 of $60,913,229. The Company
continued existence is dependent on its ability to secure requisite regulatory
approvals, successfully commercialize its products, and secure additional
funding, if required, to market its products in the United States and abroad. In
January 2001, the Company began commercializing its pain management and
industrial technology products. The Company has expanded its sales and marketing
organization, began establishing a distribution channel with medical equipment
dealers, and accepted a customer order for industrial non-destructive test
equipment and services. The Company has completed clinical trials and filed the
fifth and final module of its Breast Cancer System Pre-market Approval
application with the Food and Drug Administration FDA.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION--The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Computerized
Thermal Imaging Company CTICO, formerly known as Thermal Medical
Imaging, Inc. and Bales. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been
eliminated in consolidation.
USE OF ESTIMATES IN PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS--For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the
Company defines cash and cash equivalents as cash in checking accounts and
short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months
or less.
INVESTMENTS AVAILABLE FOR SALE--The Company invests cash reserves in U.S.
government securities, corporate bonds and certificates of deposit. Investments
with original maturities of less than one year

are considered short term. All investments are classified as available for sale
and are reported at fair market value with net unrealized gains or losses
reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. As of June 30, 2001
and 2000, there were approximately $106,000 and $32,000 of unrealized gains,
respectively.
INVENTORIES--Inventories consist of finished goods, work-in-process, and raw
materials. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost
determined using the first-in first-out method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT--Property and equipment are stated at cost and
depreciated and amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated
useful lives as follows                              
Leasehold    3 years
Office furniture and   5-7 years
Machinery and   5-7 years   INTANGIBLE ASSETS--Intangible assets are stated at cost and amortized using
the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives as follows                              
Software    3 years
10 years
Intellectual property   10 years   During the year ended June 30, 2001, the Company changed the estimated
useful life of goodwill from 15 years to 10 years. The effect of the change in
2001 was to increase the net loss by $257,877 or $0003 per common share.
REVENUE RECOGNITION--The Company recognizes revenues when it is realized or
realizable and earned, which is generally upon shipment and acceptance of
product in fulfillment of a customer order.
INCOME TAXES--The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting
for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
and tax reporting purposes. The Company has provided a valuation allowance to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be
realized.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES--The Company expenses as incurred the
direct, indirect, and purchased research and development costs associated with
its product.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS--The Company evaluates its long-lived assets
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of such assets or intangibles may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the
carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.

A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
JUNE 30, 2001 AND 2000
1. SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION--The Company has elected to follow the accounting
provisions of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR
STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, for stock options
granted to employees and directors and to furnish the pro forma disclosure
required under Statement of Financial Accounting SFAS No. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME--The Company classifies components of other
comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements and displays the
accumulated balance of other comprehensive income as a separate component of
stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets. The only component of
other comprehensive income relates to unrealized gains on investments available
for sale. Unrealized gains on investments available for sale arising during the
year ended June 30, 2001 totalled $96,000. The reclassification adjustment for
gains included in net income during 2001 was $22,000.
BASIC LOSS PER COMMON SHARE--Basic loss per common share is based on the net
loss and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each
period. Common equivalent shares from common stock options and warrants are
excluded from the computation, as their effect would be antidilutive for all
periods presented.
SEGMENT REPORTING--The Company currently operates in a single segment. In
addition, financial results are prepared and reviewed by management as a single
operating segment. The Company continually evaluates its operating activities
and the method utilized by management to evaluate such activities and will
report on a segment basis when appropriate to do so.
RECENTLY ISSUED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS--In July 2001, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.
SFAS 141 requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations
initiated after June 30, 2001 and eliminates the pooling-of-interests method.
The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 141 will have a
significant impact on its financial statements.
In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE
ASSETS, which is effective January 1, 2002. SFAS 142 requires, among other
things, the discontinuance of goodwill amortization. In addition, the standard
includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized
intangibles as goodwill, reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized
intangibles, reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported
goodwill and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing
potential future impairments of goodwill. SFAS 142 also requires the Company to
complete a transitional goodwill impairment test six months from the date of
adoption. The Company is currently assessing but has not yet determined the
impact of SFAS 142 on its financial position and results of operations.
RECLASSIFICATION--Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the 2001 presentation.

During the year ended June 30, 2001, the Company recognized an impairment
loss relating to property and equipment of approximately $150,000.
5. INTANGIBLE ASSETS
During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company concluded that changes in the
regulatory environment precluded effective marketing of its database management
system and abandoned the project. Therefore, the Company reduced the carrying
value of the software license to zero, due to the fact there was no market for
the license, and recognized an impairment loss of approximately $2,740,000.
6. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Effective April 18, 2000, the Company acquired all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Bales for $5,604,058 in cash, common stock with a
fair market value of $5,500,000, and the assumption of liabilities totaling
$155,167. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting; as such, results of operations have been included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. In
conjunction with the acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of approximately
$10,871,863, which is being amortized over 10 years.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations of the Company
for the years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999 assuming the acquisition of Bales
had occurred as of July 1, 1998 are as follows                             2000     1999

part of the minority interest of its subsidiary, CTICO, formerly known as
Thermal Medical Imaging, Inc. In 2000, the Company acquired an additional 8
percent interest in CTICO for cash of $60,000 and common

stock with a fair market value of $165,500. In 2001, the Company acquired an
additional minority interest for cash of $40,000.
Based on the fact that losses of CTICO exceeded the minority interest and
the minority interest was not obligated to make good such losses, the Company
absorbed all of the losses in excess of the minority interest before its
acquisition in 2001 and 2000. The acquisitions have been accounted for as step
acquisitions and resulted in the recognition of goodwill totaling $265,500.
7. DEFERRED REVENUES
The Company entered into two letter agreements on October 28, 1999 with
Computerized Thermal Imaging International, Inc. CTII, whereby CTII received
the exclusive right to represent the Company and market and sell its products in
Central and South America, including rights of first refusal to certain
developmental products subsequently discontinued by the Company.
In June 2000, the Company accepted a purchase order for the sale of ten
Breast Imaging Systems to CTII for $5,000,000. In connection therewith, the
Company received a down payment of $1,750,000 with the remaining $3,250,000 to
be received upon delivery.
In September 2000, the Company advised CTII of its desire to renegotiate the
foregoing agreements given substantial changes in market conditions, the
increased value of the Company common stock, and unresolved issues concerning
CTII deployment of the systems in Mexico. In October 2000, following attempts
to reach more favorable terms, the Company concluded it was in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders to mutually terminate the
agreements and the purchase order. The Company canceled the agreement and
purchase order and refunded the $1,750,000 down payment received from CTII.

The composition of net deferred tax assets and the related tax effects at

reporting purposes, the Company has approximately $53,077,000 of unused net
operating losses available for carryforward to future years. The benefit from
carryforward of such net operating losses will expire in various years between
2002 and 2020 and could be subject to severe limitations if significant
ownership changes occur in the Company. Of the $53,077,000 of unused net
operating losses noted above, approximately $6,000,000 relates to losses
incurred by the Company subsidiary, CTICO. In fiscal years prior to June 30,
2001, CTICO did not file its tax returns on a consolidated basis with the
Company. Accordingly, the $6,000,000 loss incurred by CTICO is further subject
to separate limitations that severely restrict the ability of the Company to use
such losses.
9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
LITIGATION--In connection with a private placement of the Company
securities, an individual claims that he personally placed and sold
approximately $107 million of the Company securities on contract and that the
Company failed to pay him commissions of $516,000 plus stock options to purchase
1,070,000 shares of the Company common stock valued at approximately $15
million. The individual alternatively alleges that he had a revised contract
with the Company whereby he was to receive one-third of the foregoing
commissions and stock options.
The Company has categorically denied all of the individual claims and has
affirmatively alleged that, at all times, the individual acted as an agent of
Financial Services Group, a shareholder of the Company. The Company is currently
engaged in discovery and no trial date yet has been set. The Company believes it
has meritorious defenses to the individual claims and, accordingly, no
provision for this matter has been made in the Company consolidated financial
statements.
On June 1, 2000, the Company filed a complaint against Alex Saenz that he
interfered with the Company by threatening lawsuits to recover stock options
allegedly owed to him in connection with the Company April 2000 Private
Placement. The defendant denied the Company allegations and filed a
counterclaim alleging breach of various verbal agreements to compensate him for
services rendered.

9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES CONTINUED
In August 2001, the court ruled that the defendant was not entitled to any
additional compensation from the Company. The court also dismissed the
defendant counterclaim against the Company.
The Company is a defendant in a suit brought by its former president in
connection with his termination and the termination of a severance agreement
between the former president and the Company. The former president seeks
restoration of one million stock options granted in connection with the
agreement and recovery of benefits and compensation. The Company terminated its
former president for cause and believes he is entitled to no further
compensation. Discovery is set to begin during the next 60 days. The Company
believes it has meritorious defenses to the individual claims and,
accordingly, no provision for this matter has been made in the Company
consolidated financial statements.
The Company is involved in certain other litigation matters in the normal
course of business which, in the opinion of management, will not result in any
material adverse effects on the financial position, results of operations, or
net cash flows of the Company.
CONTINGENCIES--The Company has funded its operations in part by means of
various offerings thought to be exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933 or various applicable state securities laws. In the event
that any of the exemptions upon which the Company relied were not, in fact,
available, the Company could face claims from federal and state regulators and
from purchasers of its securities. Management and legal counsel, although not
aware of any alleged specific violations, cannot predict the likelihood of
claims or the range of potential liability that could arise from this issue.
Prior to February 4, 1998, most of the Company stockholders held
preemptive rights to acquire shares of the Company common stock under certain
circumstances. In certain instances, the Company failed to properly offer
stockholders these preemptive rights. No shareholder has asserted any preemptive
rights to date. Should any stockholder do so, the Company plans to issue shares
of common stock at the price to which the stockholder was originally entitled.
OPERATING LEASES--The Company leases certain office and warehouse space.

all years; expected volatility of 164%, 164%, and 164%, respectively;
risk-free interest rate of between 427% and 671% depending upon the term of
