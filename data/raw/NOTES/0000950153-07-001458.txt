Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders   of CSK Auto Corporation   We have completed integrated audits of CSK Auto
Corporations February4, 2007 fiscal
2006, January29, 2006 fiscal 2005 and
January30, 2005 fiscal 2004 consolidated
financial statements and of its internal control over financial
reporting as of February4, 2007, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.   Consolidated
financial statements and financial statement
schedules   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the index appearing under a1 present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of CSK Auto
Corporation and its subsidiaries at February4, 2007 and
January29, 2006, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
February4, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the
index appearing under a2, present fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read
in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedules are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedules based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.   As discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
for share-based compensation in fiscal 2006.   Internal
control over financial reporting   Also, we have audited managements assessment, included in
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item9A, that CSK Auto
Corporation did not maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting as of February4, 2007, because of the
effect of material weaknesses relating to ithe
Companys control environment, which contributed to
material weaknesses related to the Companys controls
surrounding the accounting for inventory, vendor allowances,
certain accrued expenses, and store fixtures and supplies, and
iithe Companys resources, and policies and
procedures to ensure proper and consistent application of
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America GAAP, which contributed to material
weaknesses related to the Companys controls surrounding
the accounting for leases, allowance for sales returns, and
accounting for certain accrued expenses, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The
Companys management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.   We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and   
56 Table of Contents   evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A
material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
following material weaknesses have been identified and included
in managements assessment at February4, 2007.   1Control Environment:The
Company did not maintain an effective control environment based
on the criteria established in the COSO framework. The Company
failed to design controls to prevent or detect instances of
inappropriate override of, or interference with, existing
policies, procedures and internal controls. The Company did not
establish and maintain a proper tone as to internal control over
financial reporting. More specifically, senior management failed
to emphasize, through consistent communication and behavior, the
importance of internal control over financial reporting and
adherence to the Companys code of business conduct and
ethics, which, among other things, resulted in information being
withheld from, and improper explanations and inadequate
supporting documentation being provided to, the Companys
Audit Committee, its Board of Directors, its internal auditors
and independent registered public accountants. In addition,
certain members of senior management created an environment that
discouraged employees from raising accounting related concerns
and suppressed accounting related inquiries that were made.   The material weakness in the Companys control environment
discussed above permitted or contributed to the following
additional material weaknesses and the material weakness
described at 2below   aAccounting for Inventory The
Companys lack of effective controls did not prevent or
detect the inappropriate override of established procedures
regarding the adjustment of inventories for the results of
annual physical inventory counts at each of the Companys
distribution centers, warehouses and stores. In addition, the
Companys lack of effective controls did not prevent or
detect inappropriate and inaccurate accumulations of inventory
balances in in-transit accounts i.e., store returns to
warehouses, distribution centers and return centers; and to
vendors, which was known or should have been known to several
members of the Finance organization. The lack of effective
controls permitted ierrors in inventory balances to be
inappropriately systematically amortized to cost of sales in
improper periods; iiinstances where improper adjustments
were made to certain product costs within the perpetual
inventory system that, together with improper journal entries to
the general ledger, resulted in the overstatement of inventory
and cost of sales being recognized in incorrect periods; and
iiithe inappropriate capitalization of inventory
overheads purchasing, warehousing and distribution costs and
vendor allowance receivables. Additionally, Company personnel
did not properly oversee the processes for accounting for
inventory warranties and did not establish adequate accrued
liabilities for warranty returns from customers.   bAccounting for Vendor
Allowances The Companys lack of
effective controls did not detect or prevent the inappropriate
override of established procedures related to: ithe
review and approval process for initial vendor allowance
agreements; iithe monitoring of modifications to
existing vendor allowance agreements; and iiithe
accuracy of recording of various vendor allowance transactions,
including applicable   
57 Table of Contents   cash collections and estimates. Furthermore, as a result of the
lack of a sufficient complement of personnel with the requisite
level of accounting knowledge, experience and training in GAAP,
as discussed in 2below, the Company did not identify that
provisions in certain agreements were required to be accounted
for differently. The Audit Committee-led investigation revealed
that improper debits were issued and applied to accounts payable
for amounts the Company was not entitled to receive. These
amounts were subsequently repaid to those vendors through direct
cash payments, the foregoing of future cash discounts, the
acceptance of increased prices on future purchases and paybacks
through the warranty account. This material weakness resulted in
errors in vendor allowance receivables, inventory, accounts
payable and costs of sales accounts.   cAccounting for Certain Accrued
Expenses The Companys lack of
effective controls did not prevent or detect the inappropriate
override of established procedures to adjust workers
compensation liabilities to amounts determined by independent
actuaries. Errors in timing of incentive compensation accruals
resulted from inadvertent misapplication of GAAP as well as the
lack of effective controls which permitted override of
established procedures. In addition, the Company identified
improper and unsupported journal entries to the general ledger
that resulted in the misstatement of certain accrued expense
accounts and related operating and administrative expenses. This
material weakness resulted in errors in certain accrued expenses
and related operating and administrative expenses, including
workers compensation liabilities and incentive
compensation costs.   dAccounting for Store Fixtures and
Supplies The Companys lack of
effective controls did not prevent or detect the override of
established procedures for periodic physical inspections and
usability evaluations of store fixtures held for future use in a
warehouse. Specifically, the Company did not detect that certain
of these assets were impaired or did not exist and that, as a
result, their recorded cost was overstated. In addition, the
Companys controls failed to detect an inappropriate
accumulation of costs related to store fixtures and supplies in
general ledger accounts and the Companys overstatement of
supplies on hand in each store. This material weakness resulted
in errors in its store fixtures fixed assets and supplies
accounts other current assets and related operating and
administrative expenses.   2Resources, and Policies and Procedures to Ensure
Proper and Consistent Application of
GAAP:The Company did not maintain effective
controls over the application of GAAP. Specifically the Company
failed to have a sufficient complement of personnel with a level
of accounting knowledge, experience and training in the
application of GAAP commensurate with the Companys
financial reporting requirements. This material weakness in the
Companys resources and policies contributed to the
following additional material weaknesses   aAccounting for Leases The
Company did not maintain effective controls over the
completeness and accuracy of its accounting for lease related
fixed assets and debt, related operating and administrative
expenses and interest expense, and financial statement
disclosures. Specifically, the Company did not detect that a
vehicle master leasing arrangement was not properly evaluated
under GAAP.   bAllowance for Sales Returns
The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
completeness of its allowance for sales returns and the related
net sales, cost of sales, accrued liabilities and other current
assets accounts. Specifically, the Company did not detect that
it had inappropriately excluded an estimate for certain returns
that were incorrectly classified as warranty and core returns in
the Companys methodology for determining an allowance for
sales returns.   cAccounting for Certain Accrued
Expenses The Company did not maintain
effective controls over the completeness, valuation and
reporting in the proper period of certain of its accrued expense
accounts and related operating and administrative expenses. The
Company identified numerous instances of errors in accrual
accounts, including transactions not accounted for in accordance
with GAAP, that were attributable to the Companys lack of
a sufficient complement of experienced personnel and written
accounting policies and procedures in certain areas.   Each of the aforementioned material weaknesses resulted in
adjustments to the Companys fiscal 2006 and 2005 annual
and interim consolidated financial statements, and the
restatement of the Companys fiscal 2004 annual
consolidated financial statements and interim consolidated
financial statements for each of the first three quarters in
fiscal 2005. In addition, each of these above material
weaknesses could result in a material misstatement of the   
58 Table of Contents   Companys interim or annual consolidated financial
statements and disclosures that would not be prevented or
detected. These material weaknesses were considered in
determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests
applied in our audit of the fiscal 2006 consolidated financial
statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting does
not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial
statements.   In our opinion, managements assessment that CSK Auto
Corporation did not maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting as of February4, 2007, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established
in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the COSO. Also, in our opinion, because of the
effects of the material weaknesses described above on the
achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, CSK Auto
Corporation has not maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of February4, 2007, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.   /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP   Phoenix, Arizona   July6, 2007

our.   Auto is a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts and
accessories. In December 2005, we purchased all of the
outstanding stock of Murrays Inc. and its subsidiary,
Murrays Discount Auto Stores, Inc. collectively herein,
Murrays. As of the acquisition date,
Murrays operated 110 automotive parts and accessories
retail stores in Michigan, Illinois, Ohio and
Indiana states in which the Company previously had
no significant market presence.   As of February4, 2007, we operated 1,332 stores, including
five PayN Save stores, in 22states, with our
principal concentration of stores in the Western United States.
Our stores are known by the following four brand names referred
to collectively as CSK Stores   
Checker Auto Parts, founded in 1969, with 467 stores in the
Southwestern, Rocky Mountain and Northern Plains states and
Hawaii   
Schucks Auto Supply, founded in 1917, with 228 stores in
the Pacific Northwest and Alaska   
Kragen Auto Parts, founded in 1947, with 506 stores primarily in
California;and   
Murrays Discount Auto Stores, founded in 1972, with 126
stores in the Midwest.   At February4, 2007, we operated five value concept retail
stores under the Pay N Save brand name in the Phoenix, Arizona
metropolitan area, offering primarily tools, hardware,
housewares and other household goods, and seasonal items. We
closed three of the five Pay N Save stores during the first
quarter of our fiscal year ending January3, 2008
fiscal 2007. The remaining two stores have been
converted to clearance centers stocked primarily with product
from the former Pay N Save store locations. We concluded that
the sales performance of the Pay N Save stores was
unsatisfactory and believed that acceptable performance would
not be achievable without significant additional investment to
increase the store count. The Pay N Save concept provided us
with the ability to experiment with new products to determine
the level of customer demand before committing to purchase and
offer the products in the CSK Stores. This function is now being
accommodated with a combination combo store
shopping format in existing stores that are larger than our
average store size of 7,500square feet. At
February4, 2007, we had seven combo stores.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   guaranteed such debt on a full and unconditional basis. CSK Auto
Corporation is a holding company and has no other direct
subsidiaries or independent assets or operations. The Subsidiary
Guarantor is a minor subsidiary and has no significant
independent operations. Summarized financial statements and
other disclosures concerning each of Auto and the Subsidiary
Guarantor are not presented because management believes that
they are not material to investors. The consolidated amounts in
the accompanying financial statements are representative of the
combined guarantors and issuer.   The Company reports its financial information as one reportable
segment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments
of Enterprises and Related Information, as its operating
segments are its individual stores which meet the criteria for
aggregation into one reportable segment set forth in
SFASNo131.   Fiscal
Year   Our fiscal year end is on the Sunday nearest to January 31 of
the following calendar year. Fiscal 2006 consisted of
53weeks and fiscal 2005 and 2004 each consisted of
52weeks.   Cash
Equivalents   Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with
maturities of three months or less when purchased.   Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   Due to their short-term nature, the carrying value of our cash
and cash equivalents, receivables and short-term borrowings
approximate fair value. The fair values of long-term debt and
derivative financial instruments are disclosed in
Note17 Fair Value of Financial Instruments.   Derivative
Financial Instruments   Our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreement was accounted
for in accordance with SFASNo133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended,
and was recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value. Changes
in the fair value of the swap and the hedged item are recognized
currently in earnings. Our swap met the criteria to assume no
hedge ineffectiveness. The fair value of our swap was determined
from current market prices. During the second quarter of fiscal
2006, we terminated the swap agreement in connection with the
completion of our fiscal 2006 tender offer for the
$225million of 7%senior subordinated notes. See
Note9 Derivative Financial Instruments.   Receivables   Receivables are primarily comprised of amounts due from vendors
for rebates or allowances and amounts due from commercial sales
customers. We record an estimated provision for bad debts for
commercial customers based on a percentage of sales and review
the allowance quarterly for adequacy. Specific accounts are
written off against the allowance when management determines the
account is uncollectible.   Concentration
of Credit Risk   Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and
cash equivalents and trade receivables. Historically, we have
not experienced any loss of our cash and cash equivalents due to
such concentration of credit risk.   We do not hold collateral to secure payment of our trade
accounts receivable. However, management performs ongoing credit
evaluations of our customers financial condition and
provides an allowance for estimated potential losses. Exposure
to credit loss is limited to the carrying amount.

STATEMENTSContinued   Inventory
Valuation   Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, cost
being determined utilizing the
First-in,
First-Out FIFO method. At each balance sheet date,
we adjust our inventory carrying balances by an estimated
allowance for inventory shrinkage that has occurred since the
taking of physical inventories and an allowance for inventory
obsolescence, each of which is discussed in greater detail below.   
We reduce the FIFO carrying value of our inventory for estimated
loss due to shrinkage since the most recent physical inventory.
Our store shrinkage estimates are determined by dividing the
shrinkage loss based on the most recent physical inventory by
the sales for that store since its previous physical inventory.
That percentage is multiplied by sales since the last physical
inventory through period end. Our shrinkage expense for fiscal
2006, 2005 and 2004 was approximately $316million,
$288million and $208million, respectively. While
the shrinkage accrual is based on recent experience, there is a
risk that actual losses may be higher or lower than expected.   
In certain instances, we retain the right to return obsolete and
excess merchandise inventory to our vendors. In situations where
we do not have a right to return, we record an allowance
representing an estimated loss for the difference between the
cost of any obsolete or excess inventory and the estimated
retail selling price. Inventory levels and margins earned on all
products are monitored monthly. Quarterly, we make an assessment
if we expect to sell any significant amount of inventory below
cost and, if so, estimate the amount of allowance to record.   At each balance sheet reporting date, we adjust our inventory
carrying balances by the capitalization of certain operating and
overhead administrative costs associated with purchasing and
handling of inventory, an estimation of vendor allowances that
remain in ending inventory at period end and an estimation of
allowances for inventory shrinkage and obsolescence. The
components of ending inventory are as follows $ in thousands

financial reporting purposes utilizing the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which
range from three to 25years or for leasehold improvements
and property under capital leases, the shorter of the lease term
or the economic life. Maintenance and repairs are charged to
earnings when incurred. When property and equipment is retired
or sold, the net book value of the asset, reduced by any
proceeds, is charged to gain or loss. For stores in which we are
a seller-lessee and do not recover substantially all
construction costs, we record the costs in property and
equipment and amounts funded by the lessor are recorded as a
debt obligation in the accompanying balance sheet.   Internal
Software Development Costs   Certain internal software development costs are capitalized and
amortized over the life of the related software. Amounts
capitalized during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 were
$18million, $15million and $29million

STATEMENTSContinued   respectively. Accumulated amortization as of February4,
2007 and January29, 2006 was $47million and
$46million, respectively.   Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets   In accordance with SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, goodwill is no longer amortized, but
instead is assessed for impairment at least annually. Other
intangible assets consist of: 1leasehold interests
representing the net present value of the excess of the fair
rental value over the respective contractual rent of facilities
under operating leases acquired in business combinations;
2tradenames and trademarks; and 3customer
relationship intangibles. Amortization expense is computed on a
straight-line basis over the respective life of the intangibles.
See Note7 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
for the impact of this amortization on the statement of
operations.   Impairment
of Other Long-Lived Assets   Long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets to be held
and used or disposed of are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In the event assets
are impaired; losses are recognized based on the excess carrying
amount over the estimated fair value of the asset. Assets to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or
the fair market value less selling costs.   Lease
Obligations   We lease all but one of our store locations in addition to our
distribution centers, office space and most vehicles and
equipment. At the inception of the lease, we evaluate each
agreement to determine whether the lease will be accounted for
as an operating or capital lease. The term of the lease used for
this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in
instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be
reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would
result in an economic penalty. Certain leases contain rent
escalation clauses and rent holidays, which are recorded on a
straight-line basis over the lease term with the difference
between the rent paid and the straight-line rent recorded as a
deferred rent liability. Lease incentive payments received from
landlords are recorded as deferred rent liabilities and are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as a
reduction in rent. Certain leases contain provisions that
require additional rental payments based upon a specified sales
volume, which are accrued as the liabilities are incurred.   Self-Insurance
Reserves   We purchase third-party insurance for workers
compensation, automobile, product and general liability claims
that exceed a certain dollar threshold. However, we are
responsible for the payment of claims under these insured
limits. In estimating the obligation associated with reported
claims and incurred but not reported IBNR claims,
we utilize independent third-party actuaries. These actuaries
utilize historical data to project the future development of
reported claims and estimate IBNR claims. Loss estimates are
adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported
claims. Although we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to
differ significantly from our estimates, self-insurance reserves
could be affected if future claim experience differs
significantly from the historical trends and actuarial
assumptions. Our self-insurance reserves approximated
$235million and $208million at February4,
2007 and January29, 2006, respectively, and are included
with current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets.   Revenue
Recognition   We recognize sales upon the delivery of products to our
customers, which generally occurs at our retail store locations.
For certain commercial customers, we also deliver products to
customer locations. All retail and commercial sales are final
upon delivery of products. However, as a convenience to the
customer and as typical of   
68 Table of Contents   CSK AUTO
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   most retailers, we will accept merchandise returns. We generally
limit the period of time within which products may be returned
to 60days and require returns to be accompanied by
original packaging and a sales receipt. We record an estimate
for sales returns based on historical experience and record this
estimate as a reduction of net sales.   We recognize as sales the fair value of recyclable auto parts we
receive as consideration from customers that purchase a new auto
part. The Company refers to a recyclable auto part, which may or
may not have been purchased from our stores, as a
core. The Company returns these cores to vendors for
cash consideration or to settle an obligation to return a given
number of cores to vendors in situations where the Company does
not pay for the core component of the inventory acquisition
costs. The Company charges customers who purchase a new auto
part a specified amount for a core, which exceeds the value of
the core, and refunds to customers that same amount if a used
core is returned at the point of sale of the new part or upon
returning the used part to the store at a later date. If the
customer does not return a core at point of sale, the amount
charged the customer which exceeds the value of the new core is
also recognized as sales but is subject to a right of return at
the point of sale and included in our sales return allowance for
merchandise returns described above.   The Company occasionally sponsors mail-in rebate programs to
stimulate sales of particular products. At any one time, the
Company may have several of these programs in effect. The
Company estimates, based on historical experience, the amount of
rebates that will be paid to customers and reduces net sales for
the expected rebate at the time of sale of the product subject
to the rebate. Estimates are adjusted to actual redemptions at
conclusion of the redemption period.   Vendor
Allowances and Cost of Sales   Cost of sales includes product cost, net of earned vendor
rebates, discounts and allowances associated with our purchasing
activities and promotional activities with certain vendors. We
recognize such allowances as a reduction of our cost of
inventory in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF
No02-16,
Accounting by a Customer including a Reseller for Certain
Consideration Received from a Vendor. Based on EITF
No02-16,
allowances provided by our vendors are presumed to be a
reduction in the costs of purchasing inventories to be
recognized in inventory and cost of sales. Amounts recognized
are based on written contracts with vendors and the Company
enters into hundreds of contracts with allowances each year.
Contractual disputes and misunderstandings can occur with
vendors with respect to specific aspects of a vendors
program which could result in adjustments to allowances the
Company recognizes. The Company adjusts its vendor allowance
recognition for disputes when probable and reasonably estimable.
Certain of our agreements have several year terms, thus
requiring recognition over an extended period.   Warranty   The Company or the vendors supplying its products provide the
Companys customers limited warranties on certain products
that range from 30days to lifetime warranties. In most
cases, the Companys vendors are responsible for warranty
claims. Warranty costs relating to merchandise sold under
warranty not covered by vendors are estimated and recorded as
warranty obligations at the time of sale based on historical
experience and recent trends. These obligations are recorded as
a component of accrued expenses. The Company quarterly assesses
the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability and adjusts the
liability and cost of sales as necessary.

Closing Costs   If a store location does not meet our performance standards, it
is considered for closure, even if we are contractually
committed for future rental costs. We provide a discounted
allowance for estimated lease costs to be incurred subsequent to
store closure. We establish this allowance based on an
assessment of market conditions for rents and include
assumptions for vacancy periods and sublease rentals.   There are several significant assumptions that underlie the
estimates inherent in the closed store reserve, including:
1real estate broker estimates for vacancy periods and
estimated sublease rates based on the brokers experience
and expertise, and 2estimates for occupancy expenses
based on historical averages and, in the case of real estate
taxes, are subject to changes by taxing authorities.
Accordingly, we continuously review these assumptions and revise
the reserve as necessary.   In addition, there are certain assumptions that are sensitive to
deviations and could produce actual results significantly
different from managements original estimates. These
assumptions may be revised due to the following issues:
1national or regional economic conditions that can
shorten or lengthen vacancy periods; 2changes in
neighborhoods surrounding store locations resulting in longer
than anticipated vacancy periods; 3changing subtenant
needs resulting in functional obsolescence of store locations;
and 4subtenant defaults or bankruptcies resulting in
vacant properties. Historically, we have recorded revisions in
estimates to the closed store reserve that have resulted from
these issues. These revisions usually result from overall longer
vacancy periods on store locations and realized sublease rates
lower than originally anticipated.   Advertising   Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. In accordance with
EITF
No02-16,
cooperative advertising arrangements are considered a reduction
of product costs, unless we are specifically required to
substantiate costs incurred to the vendor and do so in the
normal course of business. Advertising expense for fiscal 2006,
2005 and 2004 totaled $557million, $504million and
$499million, respectively.   Preopening
Costs   Preopening expenses, which consist primarily of payroll and
occupancy costs, are expensed as incurred.   Income
Taxes   Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in
future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting amounts temporary
differences at each year-end based on enacted tax laws and
statutory rates applicable to the period in which the temporary
differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation
allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred
tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax
expense includes both taxes payable for the period and the
change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Income tax expense reflects our best estimates and

STATEMENTSContinued   assumptions regarding, among other things, the level of future
taxable income, interpretation of the tax laws, and tax
planning. Future changes in tax laws, changes in projected
levels of taxable income, and tax planning could affect the
effective tax rate and tax balances recorded.   Earnings
per Share   SFASNo128, Earnings Per Share
EPS requires earnings per share to be computed
and reported as both basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is
computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is
computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number
of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents
convertible notes and interest on the notes, stock awards and
stock options outstanding during the period. Dilutive EPS
reflects the potential dilution that could occur if options to
purchase common stock were exercised for shares of common stock.

Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.   Legal
Matters   We currently and from time to time are involved in litigation
incidental to the conduct of our business, including but not
limited to asbestos and similar product liability claims, slips
and falls and other general liability claims, discrimination and
employment claims, vendor disputes, and miscellaneous
environmental and real estate claims. The damages claimed in
some of this litigation are substantial. Based on an internal
review, we accrue reserves using our best estimate of the
probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities. We do
not currently believe that any of these legal claims incidental
to the conduct of our business, individually or in the
aggregate, will result in liabilities material to our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. However, if   
71 Table of Contents   CSK AUTO
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   our estimates related to these contingent liabilities are
incorrect, the future results of operations for any particular
fiscal quarter or year could be materially adversely affected.   In addition to the litigation that is incidental to our
business, we are also subject to the other litigation and the
SEC investigation that are described in Note16
Legal Matters. Although these matters are in their early stages
and we cannot predict their outcome, an adverse outcome in any
of them could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.   
Note2
Accounting
Change for Share-Based Compensation   Effective January30, 2006, the Company adopted
SFASNo123R, Share-Based Payment, using the
modified-prospective method and began recognizing compensation
expense for its share-based compensation plans based on the fair
value of the awards. Share-based payments include stock option
grants, restricted stock and a share-based compensation plan
under the Companys long-term incentive plan the
LTIP. Prior to January30, 2006, the Company
accounted for its stock-based compensation plans as prescribed
by Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. In
accordance with the modified-prospective transition method of
SFASNo123R, the Company has not restated prior
periods.   Stock
Options   In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Board of Directors approved
the acceleration of the vesting of all underwater
stock options those stock options previously granted with
exercise prices above $1590, the market price of the
Companys stock on January27, 2006previously
awarded to employees and executive officers. Option awards not
underwater at January27, 2006 and granted
subsequent to the Boards action are not included in the
acceleration and will vest equally over the service period
established in the award, typically three years. The primary
purpose of the accelerated vesting was to enable the Company to
avoid recognizing future compensation expense associated with
these options upon the adoption of SFASNo123R in
the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The Companys Board of
Directors took this action with the belief that it was in the
best interest of shareholders as it would reduce the
Companys reported non-cash compensation expense in future
periods.   SFASNo123R requires share-based compensation
expense recognized since January30, 2006 to be based on
the following: agrant date fair value estimated in
accordance with the original provisions of
SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, for unvested options granted prior to the
adoption date; and bgrant date fair value estimated in
accordance with the provisions of SFASNo123R for
unvested options granted subsequent to the adoption date. The
Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value all
options, and the straight-line method to amortize this fair
value as compensation cost over the requisite service period.
Total share-based compensation expense included in operating and
administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations for the fiscal year ended
February4, 2007 was approximately $20million for
the unvested options granted prior to the adoption date as well
as stock options granted during fiscal 2006. The remaining
unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards as of
February4, 2007 net of estimated forfeitures was
$49million and the weighted-average period of time over
which this cost will be recognized is 3years. Also in
fiscal 2006, the Company extended the expiration dates on
certain stock options due to expire during a period in which the
Company prohibited option exercises due to filing delinquencies
that required we suspend use of the relevant
FormS-8
registration statements, resulting in approximately
$04million in operating and administrative expense. A
summary of the Companys stock option activity and weighted
average exercise price is provided under
Note11 Employee Benefit Plans.

Dividend Yield The Company has not made any
dividend payments nor does it have plans to pay dividends in the
foreseeable future. An increase in the dividend yield will
decrease compensation expense.   Risk-Free Interest Rate This is the
U.S.Treasure rate for the date of the grant having a term
equal to the expected life of the option. An increase in the
risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense.   Expected Life This is the period of time over
which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and
is based on the mid-point option term under Staff Accounting
BulletinNo107, Share Based Payment.   Expected Volatility The Company uses actual
historical changes in the closing market price of our stock to
calculate volatility based on the expected life of the option as
it is managements belief that this is the best indicator
of future volatility. An increase in the expected volatility
will increase compensation expense.   Under SFASNo123R forfeitures are estimated at the
time of valuation and reduce expense ratably over the vesting
period. This estimate is adjusted periodically based on the
extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to
differ, from the previous estimate.   Restricted
Stock   The Company has in effect a performance incentive plan for the
Companys senior management under which the Company awards
shares of restricted stock that vest equally over a three-year
period. Shares are forfeited when an employee ceases employment.
For accounting purposes, restricted stock is valued at the grant
date fair value of the common stock. The Companys
accounting for restricted stock was not affected by the adoption
of SFAS123R. At January29, 2006, the Company had
$17million of deferred compensation costs related to
unvested restricted stock included in stockholders equity.
In accordance with SFASNo123R, the deferred
compensation balance of $17million as of January29,
2006 was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. Total
share-based compensation expense for restricted stock included
in operating and administrative expense in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal 2006, 2005
and 2004 was approximately $06million, $06million
and $01million, respectively. The remaining unrecognized
compensation cost related to unvested awards as of
February4, 2007 was $17million, and the
weighted-average period of time over which this cost will be
recognized is approximately two years. A summary of the
Companys restricted stock activity and weighted average
grant date price is provided under Note11
Employee Benefit Plans.   Long-Term
Incentive Plan   In fiscal 2005, the Compensation Committee of our Board of
Directors adopted the CSK Auto Corporation LTIP. See
Note11 Employee Benefit Plans. For accounting
purposes, the awards granted under the LTIP are considered to be
service-based, cash settled stock appreciation rights
SARs. The award is classified as a liability as
the LTIP requires the units to be paid in cash. The Company does
not have the option to pay the participant in any other form.
While the amount of cash, if any, that will ultimately be
received by the participant is not known until the end of the
measuring period, the only condition that determines whether the

SFASNo123R whereby the intrinsic value of the award
is recognized each period multiplied by the related percentage
of service rendered. FASB Interpretation No28,
Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable
Stock Option or Award Plans FIN28
requires that the compensation cost for such awards be
recognized over the service period for each separately vesting
tranche of award as though the award were, in substance,
multiple awards.   The Company concluded that, for purposes of initial recognition,
the initial award date occurred on June28, 2005, as both
the number of units that each initial participant was entitled
to and the exercise price were known by such initial
participants at that date. However, since the Companys
stock price did not exceed $20 per share at any time from the
measurement date through the end of fiscal 2005, no compensation
cost was recognized, and no pro-forma expense for this award is
reflected in the SFASNo123 disclosures.   The LTIP units are classified as a liability award under
SFASNo123R, and as such, must be measured at fair
value at the grant date and recognized as compensation cost over
the service period in accordance with FIN28. The modified
prospective transition rules under SFASNo123R
require that for an outstanding instrument that previously was
classified as a liability and measured at intrinsic value, an
entity should recognize the effect of initially measuring the
liability at its fair value, net of any related tax effect, as
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. At
the beginning of fiscal 2006, the Company recorded
$10million, net of $06million income tax benefit,
as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for
the LTIP fair value liability under SFASNo123R upon
adoption. For the fiscal year ended February4, 2007, the
Company recognized $03million of expense related to the
LTIP units. At February4, 2007, the Company had recorded a
liability of $19million related to LTIP units and had
$15million of unrecognized compensation cost related to
LTIP units. As a liability based instrument, the LTIP awards
will be remeasured at each balance sheet date, such that the net
compensation expense recorded over the full four-year vesting
period of the LTIP units will equal the cash payments, if any,
made by the Company to the LTIP participants.

deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be
reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating
cash flow. This requirement reduces net operating cash flows and
increases net financing cash flows in periods after adoption.
While the Company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in
the future because they depend on when employees exercise stock
options and the current market price, the amounts of operating
cash flows recognized for such excess tax deductions for stock
option exercises were $02million and $04million in
fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively.   In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

FAS123R-3,
Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects

alternative method as described in the FSP. An entity that
adopts SFAS123R using the modified prospective application

calculate the additional paid-in-capital pool as prescribed in

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   In February 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo155,
Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial

No133 and 140. This statement simplifies accounting
for certain hybrid instruments currently governed by
SFASNo133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, by allowing fair value remeasurement
of hybrid instruments that contain an embedded derivative that
otherwise would require bifurcation. SFASNo155 also

No125, by eliminating the restriction on passive
derivative instruments that a qualifying special-purpose entity
may hold. SFASNo155 is effective for financial
instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of our fiscal
year 2007. The Company does not expect the adoption of
SFASNo155 to have a material impact on its
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.   In March 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo156,
Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets an
amendment of FASB Statement No140.
SFASNo156 amends SFASNo140,
Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities, with respect to the
accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and

fiscal years beginning after September15, 2006. The
Company does not expect the adoption of SFASNo156
to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.   In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
FIN48. The interpretation clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the
Companys financial statements in accordance with
SFASNo109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
FIN48 will be effective for the Company beginning in
fiscal 2007. The Company has not determined the effect, if any,
the adoption of FIN48 will have on the Companys
financial position and results of operations.   In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting
BulletinNo108, Considering the Effects of Prior
Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current
Year Financial Statements, SAB108.
SAB108 was issued in order to eliminate the diversity in
practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial
statement misstatements. SAB108 requires that registrants
quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement
approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a
misstated amount that, when all relevant quantitative and
qualitative factors are considered, is material. SAB108 is
effective for financial statements covering the first fiscal
year ending after November15, 2006. The Company adopted
SAB108 for the year ended February4, 2007 with no
impact on its consolidated financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo157,
Fair Value Measurements, which clarifies the definition
of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
within generally accepted accounting principles and expands the
disclosures on fair value measurements. SFAS157 is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after November15, 2007. The Company does not
expect the adoption of SFASNo157 to have a material
impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.   In February 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo159, The
Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities, which permits entities to choose to measure
many financial instruments and certain other items at fair

beginning after November15, 2007. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of SFASNo159.

Acquisition   On December19, 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding
stock of Murrays, a private company headquartered in
Belleville, Michigan, that operated 110 automotive parts and

Indiana. The purchase price was $1809million. As of

during fiscal 2007. The Murrays acquisition complemented
our existing operations and expanded our markets served from 19
to 22states. The acquisition was funded from borrowings
under a $3250million senior secured asset-based revolving
credit facility and from the issuance of the
63/4%senior
exchangeable notes. See Note7 Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets.   This transaction has been accounted for in accordance with
SFASNo141, Business Combinations, and
accordingly the financial position and results of operations
have been included in our operations since the date of
acquisition. In accordance with SFASNo141, the
purchase price was allocated to the fair value of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed, including identifiable
intangible assets. The allocation of purchase price resulted in
an inventory fair value adjustment of $28million, which
was expensed to cost of sales in fiscal 2005 and 2006
corresponding to the periods in which the inventory was sold.
The excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets
acquired resulted in $1045million of non-tax deductible
goodwill primarily related to the anticipated future earnings
and cash flows of the Murrays retail stores, as well as
cost reductions management expects as a result of integrating
administrative functions including operations, finance, human
resources, purchasing and information technology. Of the
$591million of identifiable intangible assets,
$494million was assigned to Murrays trade name and
trademarks with a life of 30years, $93million was
assigned to leasehold interests with an average life of
17years and $04million was assigned to customer
relationships with a life of 10years. In addition, we
recorded a $75million liability for leasehold interests
for operating leases that had rental commitments in excess of
current market conditions with an average life of
18years.   The final purchase price allocation recorded in fiscal 2005 was

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets   We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of
February4, 2007, the last day of our fiscal year, and we
determined that no impairment of goodwill existed. Under
SFASNo142, the Companys stores, including the
recently acquired Murrays stores, are considered
components with similar economic characteristics which can be
aggregated into one reporting unit for goodwill impairment
testing.   Our intangible assets, excluding goodwill, consist of favorable
leasehold interests, license agreement, trade names and
trademarks, and customer relationship intangibles resulting from
business acquisitions. Amortization expense related to
intangible assets is computed on a straight-line basis over the
respective useful lives. Leasehold interests associated with
store closures are written off at the time of closure.   In August 2006, we purchased a franchised Murrays store
which resulted in $14million of goodwill. See
Note4 Business Acquisition.   Of the $591million of identifiable intangible assets
resulting from the fiscal 2005 acquisition of Murrays,
$494million was assigned to Murrays trade name and
trademarks with a life of 30years, $93million was
assigned to leasehold interests asset with an average life of
17years and $04million was assigned to customer
relationships with a life of 10years. The excess
purchase price over identifiable tangible and intangible assets
was approximately $1045million, which was recorded as
goodwill. See Note4 Business Acquisition.   On January21, 2005, the Company sold its subsidiary, AIS,
a provider of diagnostic vehicle repair information, to MPI. As
a result of the sale, the Company received a note receivable
with a fair value of approximately $71million, and MPI
granted a licensing agreement to us which was valued at
approximately $44million and is being amortized over
seven years.

STATEMENTSContinued   Term
Loan Facility   In order to repay the 7%Notes and the
33/8%Notes
described below, we entered into a $3500million Term Loan
Facility in June 2006. The loans under the Term Loan Facility
Term Loans bear interest at a base rate or the
LIBOR rate, plus a margin that will fluctuate depending upon the
rating of the Term Loans. At February4, 2007, the interest
rate was 8375%. The Term Loans are guaranteed by the Company
and CSKAUTO.COM, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Auto. The
Term Loans are secured by a second lien security interest in
certain of our assets, primarily inventory and receivables, and
by a first lien security interest in substantially all of our
other assets. The Term Loans call for repayment in consecutive
quarterly installments, which began on December31, 2006,
in an amount equal to 025% of the aggregate principal amount of
the Term Loans, with the balance payable in full on the sixth
anniversary of the closing date, or June30, 2012. Costs
associated with the Term Loan Facility were approximately
$107million and, beginning June30, 2006, are being
amortized to interest expense following the interest method over
the six-year term of the facility.   The Term Loan Facility contains, among other things, limitations
on liens, indebtedness, mergers, disposition of assets,
investments, payments in respect of capital stock, modifications
of material indebtedness, changes in fiscal year, transactions
with affiliates, lines of business, and swap agreements. Auto is
also subject to financial covenants under the Term Loan Facility
measuring its performance against standards set for leverage and
fixed charge coverage. See Note19 Subsequent
Events.   Senior
Credit Facility   At February4, 2007 and January29, 2006, Auto had a
$3250million senior secured revolving line of credit.
Auto is the borrower under the agreement and it is guaranteed by
the Company and CSKAUTO.COM, Inc. Borrowings under the Senior
Credit Facility bear interest at a variable interest rate based
on one of two indices, either iLIBOR plus an applicable
margin that varies 125% to 175% depending upon Autos
average daily availability under the agreement measured using
certain borrowing base tests, or iithe Alternate Base
Rate as defined in the agreement. The Senior Credit Facility
matures in July 2010.   During fiscal 2006, we entered into a waiver under the Senior
Credit Facility to allow us until June13, 2007 to file
certain periodic reports with the SEC. Costs associated with the
waiver were approximately $16million, were recorded as
deferred financing fees in fiscal 2006, and are being amortized
through July 2010. See Note19 Subsequent
Events.   Availability under the Senior Credit Facility is limited to the
lesser of the revolving commitment of $3250million and a
borrowing base limitation. The borrowing base limitation is
based upon a formula involving certain percentages of eligible
inventory and eligible accounts receivable owned by Auto. As a
result of the limitations imposed by the borrowing base formula,
at February4, 2007, Auto could only borrow up to an
additional $1400million of the $3250million
facility in addition to the $520million already borrowed
under the Senior Credit Facility at an average interest rate of
approximately 6875%, and $341million of letters of
credit outstanding under this facility as of February4,
2007. At each balance sheet date, we classify, as a current
liability, balances outstanding under the revolving portion of
the Senior Credit Facility we expect to repay during the
following 12months. Loans under the Senior Credit Facility
are collateralized by a first priority security interest in
certain of our assets, primarily inventory and accounts
receivable, and a second priority security interest in certain
of our other assets. The Senior Credit Facility contains
negative covenants and restrictions on actions by Auto and its
subsidiaries including, without limitation, restrictions and
limitations on indebtedness, liens, guarantees, mergers, asset
dispositions, investments, loans, advances and acquisitions,
payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates, change in
business conducted and certain prepayments and amendments of
indebtedness. In addition, since June16, 2006, Auto has
been required to maintain a minimum 1:1 Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio as defined in the agreement.

63/4%Notes   In June 2006, we commenced a cash tender offer and consent
solicitation with respect to our $1000million of
45/8%Notes.
We did not purchase any notes in the tender offer because
holders of a majority of the outstanding
45/8%Notes
did not tender in the offer prior to its expiration date. We
later obtained the consent of the holders of a majority of the
45/8%Notes
to enter into a supplemental indenture to the indenture under
which the
45/8%Notes
were originally issued that iwaived any default arising
from Autos failure to file certain financial information
with the Trustee for the notes, iiexempted Auto from
compliance with the SEC filing covenants in the indenture until
June30, 2007, iiiincreased the interest rate of
the notes to
63/4%
per year until December15, 2010 and
61/2%
per year thereafter, and ivincreased the exchange rate
of the notes from 498473shares of our common stock per
$1,000 principal amount of notes to 606061shares of our
common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes hereinafter,
these notes are referred to as the
63/4%Notes.
All other terms of the indenture are unchanged. Costs associated
with the tender offer and supplemental indenture were
approximately $05million and were recognized in operating
and administrative expenses in the second quarter of fiscal
2006. Under the registration rights agreement see below,
additional interest of 25basis points began to accrue on
the
63/4%Notes
in March 2006 and increased to 50basis points in June
2006. In total, we incurred approximately $15million in
additional interest expense in fiscal 2006 related to the
increase in the coupon interest rate to
63/4%
and the additional interest expense under the registration
rights agreement. Also, in accordance with EITF No.
06-6,
Debtors Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of
Convertible Debt Instruments, the changes to the
63/4%Notes
were recorded in fiscal 2006 as a modification, not an
extinguishment, of the debt. The Company recorded the increase
in the fair value of the exchange option as a debt discount with
a corresponding increase to additional
paid-in-capital
in stockholders equity. The debt discount was
$77million and is being amortized to interest expense
following the interest method to the first date the noteholders
could require repayment. Total amortization on the debt discount
was $08million as of February4, 2007.

Notes   In July 2006, we completed a tender offer for our 7%Notes,
in which we repurchased virtually all of the 7%Notes for
the principal amount of $22496million. We purchased the
balance of the 7%Notes later in fiscal 2006. Unamortized
deferred financing fees at the time of repurchase were
45million, and costs associated with the transaction were
approximately $06million, all of which was recognized as
a loss on debt retirement during the second quarter of fiscal
2006. In connection with the repurchase of the 7%Notes, we
terminated our interest rate swap agreement, which was intended
to hedge the fair value of $1000million of the
7%Notes. Consideration of $111million was paid to
terminate the swap, of which $104million represented the
fair value liability and $07million represented accrued
interest. The $104million was recognized as a loss during
the second quarter of fiscal 2006.   In January 2004, we issued $225million of our
7%Notes due January15, 2014, with interest payable
semi-annually on January 15 and July15. We were permitted
to redeem all of the notes prior to January15, 2009,
pursuant to the make-whole provisions as defined in the
indenture under which the 7%Notes were issued. In
addition, we were permitted to redeem up to 35% of the aggregate
principal amount of the notes before January15, 2007 with
the net proceeds of certain equity offerings. At any time on or
after January15, 2009, we were permitted to redeem some or

at the following redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of redemption expressed as percentages of
the principal amount: January15, 2009 through

defined in the indenture under which the notes were issued,
holders of the notes were permitted to require us to repurchase
their notes at a purchase price of 101% of the principal amount
of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated
damages, if any, to the date of the purchase.   The 7%Notes were unsecured general obligations of Auto.
They ranked junior in right of payment to all of our existing

the time of repayment were $40million, and costs

September 2006, the equity call option and warrant contracts
were terminated and settled with the counterparty. We elected a
cash settlement and received approximately $30million for
the call option and paid $14million for the warrant
contract. These amounts represented the fair value of the
contracts at the termination date and were recorded as
additional paid-in capital in fiscal 2006.   The

During any fiscal quarter and only during that fiscal quarter
commencing after January29, 2006, if the last reported
sale price of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130%
of the exchange price for at least 20 trading days in the period

Upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions, such as
a change in control, as described in the indentures under which

33/8%Notes
had become exchangeable, the corresponding debt was to be
reclassified from long-term to current for as long as the notes
remained exchangeable.   In connection with the issuance of the
33/8%Notes,
we paid $270million to a counterparty to purchase a call
option designed to mitigate the potential dilution from the
exchange of the
33/8%Notes.
Under the call option, as amended, we had an option to purchase
from the counterparty 5,414,063shares, subject to
adjustment, of our common stock at a price of $2309 per share,
which is equal to the initial exchange price of the
33/8%Notes.
We received an aggregate of $178million of proceeds from
the same counterparty relating to the sale of warrants to
acquire, subject to adjustment, up to 5,414,063shares of
our common stock. The warrants were exercisable at a price of
$2629 per share. Both the call option and warrant transactions
had five-year terms. The call option and warrant transactions
were each to be settled through a net share settlement to the
extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the exercise
price set forth in the agreements. Our objective with these
transactions was to reduce the potential dilution of our common
stock upon an exchange of the
33/8%Notes.
We accounted for the call option and the warrant as equity under
EITF

Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to,
and Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own Stock.   The embedded exchange feature in the

put options and the call options in the debt as well as the
separate freestanding call options and the warrants associated

each met the requirements of EITF
No00-19
to be accounted for as equity instruments. As such, the share
exchange feature, the put options and call options embedded in
the debt and the separate freestanding call options and the
warrants have not been accounted for as derivatives which would
be marked to market each reporting period. In the event the
33/8%Notes
were exchanged, the exchange was to be accounted for in a
similar manner to a conversion with no gain or loss as the cash
payment of principal reduces the recorded liability issued at
par and the issuance of common shares would have been recorded
in stockholders equity. Any accrued interest on the debt
would not be paid separately upon an exchange and would be
reclassified to equity. In addition, the premium paid for the
call option and the premium received for the warrant were
recorded as additional paid-in capital in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet and were not accounted for as
derivatives which would be marked to market each reporting
period. Incremental net shares for the
33/8%Notes
exchange features and the warrant agreements were to be included
in our future diluted earnings per share calculations for those
periods in which our average common stock price exceeded $2309
in the case of the
33/8%Notes,
and $2629 in the case of the warrants. The purchased call
option was anti-dilutive and was excluded from the diluted
earnings per share calculation.   We entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to
the
33/8%Notes
and the underlying shares of our common stock into which the
33/8%Notes
were potentially exchangeable. Under its terms, we would have
been required to pay additional interest of up to 50basis

Financing Arrangements   Seller financing arrangements relate to debt established for
stores in which we were the seller-lessee and did not recover
substantially all construction costs from the lessor. In those
situations, we recorded our total cost in property and equipment
and amounts funded by the lessor as a debt obligation in the
accompanying balance sheet in accordance with EITF
No97-10,
The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction. A
portion of the rental payments made to the lessor are charged to
interest expense and reduce the corresponding debt based on
amortization schedules.   Debt
Covenants   Certain of our debt agreements at February4, 2007
contained negative covenants and restrictions on actions by us
and our subsidiaries including, without limitation, restrictions
and limitations on indebtedness, liens, guarantees, mergers,
asset dispositions, investments, loans, advances and
acquisitions, payment of dividends, transactions with
affiliates, change in business conducted, and certain
prepayments and amendments of indebtedness. In addition, our
Senior Credit Facility and our Term Loan Facility contain
certain financial covenants as discussed below.   A breach of the covenants or restrictions contained in these
debt agreements could result in an event of default thereunder.
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of
default under either the Senior Credit Facility or the Term Loan
Facility, the lenders thereunder could elect to terminate the
commitments thereunder in the case of the Senior Credit
Facility only, declare all amounts owing thereunder to be
immediately due and payable and exercise the remedies of a
secured party against the collateral granted to them to secure
such indebtedness. If the lenders under either the Senior Credit
Facility or the Term Loan Facility accelerate the payment of the
indebtedness due thereunder, we cannot be assured that our
assets would be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness,
which is collateralized by substantially all of our assets. At
February4, 2007, we were in compliance with or had
obtained waivers with respect to the covenants under all our
debt agreements.   The Senior Credit Facility requires a minimum 1:1 Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio as defined in the Senior Credit Facility under
certain circumstances. For the four quarters ended
February4, 2007, this Ratio as so defined was 147:1. The
Term Loan Facility also contains certain financial covenants,
one of which is the requirement of a minimum Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio as separately defined in the Term Loan Facility
of 14:1 until December31, 2008 and 145:1 thereafter. For
the four quarters ended February4, 2007, this Ratio was
155:1. The Term Loan Facility, as amended, also requires that a
leverage ratio test be met. The maximum leverage ratio permitted
was 375:1 at the end of fiscal 2006 and is 395:1, 385:1,
375:1 and 350:1 for the first, second, third and fourth
quarters, respectively, of fiscal 2007. The leverage ratio
further declines to 325:1 at the end of fiscal 2008 and 300:1
at the end of fiscal 2009. Our leverage ratio was 331:1 as of
February4, 2007. The leverage ratios for fiscal 2007
reflect the April27, 2007 second amendment of the Term
Loan Facility in which certain fiscal 2007 leverage ratios were
modified as set forth above to provide greater flexibility along
with the elimination of undrawn letters of credit from the
definition of debt. Based on our current financial forecasts for
fiscal 2007, we believe we will remain in compliance with the
financial covenants of the Senior Credit Facility and Term Loan
Facility described above for fiscal 2007 and the foreseeable
future. However, a significant decline in our net sales or gross
margin or unanticipated significant increases in operating costs
or LIBOR-based interest rates could limit the effectiveness of
discretionary actions management could take to maintain
compliance with financial covenants. Although we dont
expect such significant decreases and increases to occur, if
they did occur, we would seek to obtain a covenant waiver from
our lenders or seek a refinancing, both of which we believe are
viable options for the Company. However, there can be no
assurances a waiver would be obtained or a refinancing could be
achieved.   On June11, 2007, we entered into a third waiver to our
Senior Credit Facility that extended the then current waiver
relating to the delivery thereunder of our delinquent periodic
SEC filings and related financial statements until the earliest
of iAugust15, 2007, iithe filing with the
SEC of all such delinquent SEC filings up to and including our
Form10-Q

2007 with respect to the covenant relating to the need to file
and deliver to the trustee for the

of our periodic SEC filings that are delinquent by June30,
2007, and if a notice of default is given to the Company by the
trustee for such Notes or by the holders of 25% of the Notes, a
default will occur under the indenture under which the
63/4%
Notes were issued that would entitle the holders of the
63/4%Notes
to accelerate the payment of their Notes no sooner than
August31, 2007. The occurrence of an event of default
under the indenture under which the
63/4%Notes
were issued, along with the expiration of the applicable grace
period thereunder, would result in an event of default under the
Senior Credit Facility, which would in turn result in an event
of default under the Term Loan Facility.   We expect to be able to complete all of our late periodic SEC
filings by August15, 2007, which is within the 60day
period following such a default during which we can cure such a
default and prevent the holders of the
63/4%Notes
from having the right to accelerate their Notes. Filing by
August15, 2007 should permit us to avoid the acceleration
of the
63/4%Notes
and any related negative consequences under the Senior Credit
Facility and the Term Loan Facility. Nevertheless, if we were to
fail to complete such filings by August15, 2007, and were
neither able to negotiate compromises that would avoid the
acceleration or cross acceleration of all our other indebtedness
for borrowed money nor refinance all or a portion of such
indebtedness, the possibility exists that we would be unable to
repay such indebtedness and could be declared insolvent.   Restrictions
on Paying Dividends and Movement of Funds   Under the Senior Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility,
Auto is prohibited from declaring dividends or making other
distributions with respect to its stock, subject to certain
exceptions, including an exception permitting stock dividends.
However, Auto may make distributions to the Company so that the
Company may take certain actions, including, without limitation,
payments of franchise taxes, other fees required to maintain its
corporate existence, operating costs and income taxes,
repurchases of the Companys stock from former employees
subject to a dollar limitation, certain loans to employees and
up to $250million of other stock repurchases or
redemptions, subject to certain conditions. In July 2005, the
Company repurchased approximately $250million of our
common stock utilizing proceeds from the issuance of our

swap approximated $67million, which was included as an
increase in other long-term liabilities with an identical amount
reflected as a basis adjustment to the 7%Notes on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The differential to be
paid under the agreement was accrued consistent with the terms
of the swap agreement and was recognized in interest expense
over the term of the related debt. The related amount payable to
the counter party was included in accrued liabilities.   In July 2006, we paid $111million to terminate the swap
agreement, representing $104million of a fair value
liability and $07million of accrued interest. The
$104million was recognized as a loss on debt retirement
during the second quarter of fiscal 2006. As of February4,

STATEMENTSContinued   On March7, 2005, the Company entered into a five year
logistics services agreement with Penske Logistics
Penske whereby Penske provides substantially all
of transportation services needs for inventory movement between
each of our distribution centers, warehouses and stores.
Billings from Penske contain bundled fixed and variable
components covering the costs of dispatching, drivers, fuel,
maintenance, equipment and other costs of providing the
services. Although the agreement has a five-year term, it is
cancellable by either party at each anniversary date of the
agreement. Should the Company cancel the agreement early without
cause, we would be subject to certain costs of early
termination. Amounts expensed to Penske for logistics services
were approximately $156million for the period of
March7, 2005 through January29, 2006 and
$222million for all of fiscal 2006.

Employee
Benefit Plans   We provide various health, welfare and disability benefits to
our full-time employees that are funded primarily by Company
contributions. Other than for certain of our senior executives,
we do not provide post-employment or post-retirement health care
or life insurance benefits to our employees.   Supplemental
Retirement Plan Agreement   We have a supplemental executive retirement plan agreement with
our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Maynard Jenkins, which
provides supplemental retirement benefits for a period of
10years beginning on the first anniversary of the
effective date of termination of his employment for any reason
other than for Cause as defined in such retirement plan
agreement. The benefit amount in this agreement is fully vested
and payable to Maynard Jenkins at a rate of $600,000 per annum.
In January 2006, this agreement was amended to make such changes
as were necessary to bring the agreement into compliance with
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. We have accrued the
entire present value of this obligation of approximately
$41million as of January29, 2006 and
February4, 2007.   Retirement
Program   We sponsor a 401k plan that is available to all our employees
who, up until December31, 2006, had to have completed one
year of continuous service to be eligible. Effective
October1, 1997, we match from 40% to 60% of employee
contributions in 10% increments, based on years of service, up
to 4% of the participants base salary. Participant
contributions are subject to certain restrictions as set forth
in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Our matching
contributions totaled $19million, $15million and
$15million for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively.
Effective January1, 2007, we amended the 401k plan to
provide immediate eligibility for participation at the date of
hire if the employee is at least 21years of age; however,
no Company matching contributions vest until one year of plan
participation or three years of Company service.   We also sponsor the CSK Auto, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan.
This plan is maintained primarily to provide deferred
compensation benefits for a select group of management
or highly compensated employees as defined by the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
ERISA. For Internal Revenue Code IRC
and ERISA purposes, this plan is deemed to be
unfunded. The Deferred Compensation Plan permits
participants voluntarily to defer up to 50% of their salary and
100% of their annual bonus without regard to the limitations
under the IRC applicable to the Companys tax-qualified
plans. In addition, any refunds resulting from
non-discrimination testing of the Companys 401k Plan
will be automatically transferred from the participants
401k account to the Deferred Compensation Plan. Although the
Company may also make matching contributions to a
participants account under this plan except for automatic
transfers of excess Company matching contributions from a
participants 401k plan account, the Company has not
elected to do so. Deferred amounts and any matching
contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan are 100%
vested at all times, and are invested on behalf of the
participant in investment vehicles selected from time to time by
the administrators of the plan. Benefits are payable at
retirement in either a lump sum or installments for up to
12years. Benefits upon a termination of employment prior
to retirement are payable only in a lump sum.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Long-Term
Incentive Plan   In fiscal 2005, the Compensation Committee of our Board of
Directors adopted the CSK Auto Corporation Long-Term Incentive
Plan. The LTIP was established within the framework of the CSK
Auto Corporation 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan, pursuant to
which cash-based incentive bonus awards may be granted based
upon the satisfaction of specified performance criteria. The
Board also approved and adopted forms of Incentive Bonus Unit
Award Agreements used to evidence the awards under the LTIP.
Under the terms of the LTIP, participants senior executive
officers only were awarded a certain number of incentive units
that are subject to a four-year vesting period 25% per year,
with the first vesting period ending in fiscal 2007as
well as stock performance criteria. Subject to specific terms
and conditions governing a change in control of the Company,
each incentive bonus unit, when vested, represents the
participants right to receive cash payments from the
Company on specified payment dates equal to the amounts, if any,
by which the average of the per share closing prices of the
Companys common stock on the New York Stock Exchange over
a specified period of time after release by the Company of its
fiscal year earnings the measuring period exceeds
$20 per share which figure is subject to certain adjustments in
the event of a change in the Companys capitalization. The
Company recorded $10million, net of $06million
income tax benefit, as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle for the LTIP fair value liability under
SFAS123R. For the year ended February4, 2007, the
Company recognized $03million of expense related to the
LTIP units. At February4, 2007, the Company had recorded a
liability of $19million related to LTIP units. See
Note2 Share Based Employee Compensation Plans.   2004
Stock and Incentive Plan   In June 2004, our shareholders approved the CSK Auto Corporation
2004 Stock and Incentive Plan the Plan, which
replaces all of the following previously existing plans:
1the 1996 Associate Stock Option Plan; 2the 1996
Executive Stock Option Plan; 3the 1999 Executive Stock
Option Plan; and 4the CSK Auto Corporation Directors
Stock Plan. Approximately 19million options to purchase
shares of our common stock granted under these prior plans were
still outstanding at the inception of the new Plan. These
options can still be exercised by the grantees according to the
provisions of the prior plans. Pursuant to the provisions of the
Plan, any of these options which are cancelled under the prior
plans will be added to shares available for issuance under the
Plan.   The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of our
Board of Directors, which has broad authority in administering
and interpreting the Plan. We believe the Plan promotes and
closely aligns the interests of our employees and directors with
our stockholders by permitting the award of stock-based
compensation and other performance-based compensation. We
believe the Plan will strengthen our ability to reward
performance that enhances long-term stockholder value and to
attract and retain outstanding employees and executives. Plan
participation is limited to employees of the Company, any
subsidiary or parent of the Company and directors of the Company.   The Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options,
non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, stock units, incentive bonuses and other stock
unit awards. Under the Plan, the number and kind of shares as to
which options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
stock units, incentive bonuses or other stock unit awards may be
granted is 40million shares of our common stock plus any
shares subject to awards made under the prior plans that were
outstanding on the effective date of the Plan. The number of
shares that can be granted for certain of the items listed above
may be restricted per the Plan document. In no event will any
option be exercisable more than 10years after the date the
option is granted. In general, the stock incentives vest in
three years. As of February4, 2007, there were
approximately 16million shares available for grant.

approved the acceleration of the vesting of all
underwater stock options those stock options
previously granted with exercise prices above $1590, the market
price of the Companys stock on January27,
2006previously awarded to employees and executive
officers. Option awards granted subsequent to the Boards
action are not included in the acceleration and will vest
equally over the service period established in the award,
typically three years.   As a result of the vesting acceleration, options to purchase
approximately 770,775shares became exercisable
immediately; however, restrictions on the sale of any such
shares obtained by way of the exercise of accelerated options
were imposed to minimize unintended personal benefits to the
option holders. Sales of such shares may not occur until the
original vesting dates, and sales of any such shares by officers
and employees who terminate their employment with the Company
subject to certain exceptions in the case of retirement, death,
disability and change of control are disallowed for three years
following the later of the date of their termination of
employment or their exercise of the options.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   We have recorded deferred tax assets of approximately
$400million as of February4, 2007 reflecting the
benefit of federal and state tax loss carryforwards
approximating $1085million and $482million, which
begin to expire in 2021 and 2007, respectively. Realization is
dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to
expiration of the loss carryforwards. Utilization of certain of
the net operating loss carryforwards may be limited under
Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Although
realization is not assured, management believes it is more
likely than not that all the deferred tax assets will be
realized with the exception of a portion of California
Enterprise Zone credits and a portion of Arizona net operating
losses for which management has determined that a valuation
allowance in the amount of $14million and
$03million, respectively, is necessary.   We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based
on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional
taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of
these amounts is not required, we reverse the liability and
recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine
that the liability is no longer necessary. We record an
additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in
which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than
we expect the ultimate assessment to be.   
Note13
Store
Closing Costs   On an on-going basis, store locations are reviewed and analyzed
based on several factors including market saturation, store
profitability, and store size and format. In addition, we
analyze sales trends and geographical and competitive factors to
determine the viability and future profitability of our store
locations. If a store location does not meet our required
performance, it is considered for closure. As a result of past
acquisitions, we have closed numerous locations due to store
overlap with previously existing store locations.   We account for the costs of closed stores in accordance with
SFASNo146, Accounting for Costs Associated with
Exit or Disposal Activities. Under SFASNo146,
costs of operating lease commitments for a closed store are
recognized as expense at fair value at the date we cease
operating the store. Fair value of the liability is determined
as the present value of future cash flows discounted using a
credit-adjusted risk free rate. Accretion expense represents
interest on our recorded closed store liabilities at the same
credit adjusted risk free rate used to discount the cash flows.
In addition, SFASNo146 also requires that the
amount of remaining lease payments owed be reduced by estimated
sublease income but not to an amount less than zero. Sublease
income in excess of costs associated with the lease is
recognized as it is earned and included as a reduction to
operating and administrative expense in the accompanying
financial statements.   The allowance for store closing costs is included in accrued
expenses and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying
financial statements and primarily represents the discounted
value of the following future net cash outflows related to
closed stores: 1future rents to be paid over the
remaining terms of the lease agreements for the stores net of
estimated probable sublease income; 2lease commissions
associated with the anticipated store subleases; and
3contractual expenses associated with the closed store
vacancy periods. Certain operating expenses, such as utilities
and repairs, are expensed as incurred and no provision is made
for employee termination costs.   As of February4, 2007, we had a total of 175 locations
included in the allowance for store closing costs, consisting of
122 store locations and 53 service centers. Of the store
locations, 15 locations were vacant and 107 locations were
subleased. Of the service centers, 3 were vacant and 50 were
subleased. Future rent expense will be incurred through the
expiration of the non-cancelable leases.

liabilities; and 3$08million associated with
other operating expenses such as utilities, repairs and

1$02million in charges associated with fiscal
2005 store closures; 2$15million in charges
resulting from revisions in estimates, primarily related to
stores that were subleased and became vacant as well as rent
increases in master lease agreements; 3$04million
associated with accretion expense relating to the discounting of
closed store liabilities; and 4$07million
associated with other operating expenses such as utilities,
repairs and maintenance costs that are expensed as incurred.   During fiscal 2004, we recorded the following:
1$02million in charges associated with fiscal
2004 store closures; 2$06million in charges
resulting from revisions in estimates;
3$06million associated with accretion expense
relating to the discounting of closed store liabilities; and
4$08million associated with other operating
expenses such as utilities, repairs and maintenance costs that
are expensed as incurred.   We expect net cash outflows for closed store locations of
approximately $40million during fiscal 2007. We plan to
fund these cash outflows and future cash outflows from normal
operating cash flows. We anticipate that we will close or
relocate approximately 26 stores in fiscal 2007. We anticipate
that the majority of these closures will occur near the end of
the lease terms, resulting in minimal closed store costs.

Transactions
and Relationships with Related Parties   Upon his retirement as President and Chief Operating Officer of
the Company in April 2000, the Company entered into an
employment agreement with Mr.James Bazlen, a member of our
Board of Directors, for the performance of specific projects for
the Company, as designated by the Chief Executive Officer or
President, for an annual base salary of $50,000 and continued
payment of certain medical, dental, insurance, 401k and other
benefits. This agreement is terminable by either party upon
written notice. In connection with his membership on our Board
of Directors, Mr.Bazlen receives all compensation
including annual grants of stock options, except for the
Annual Stipend, that is provided to our outside directors under
the Outside Director Compensation Policy.   The Company entered into an agreement on November18, 2005
with Evercore Financial Advisors L.L.C. Evercore
for certain financial advisory services in connection with our
acquisition of Murrays. William A. Shutzer, one of our
directors, is a Senior Managing Director of Evercore. Under the
agreement, we agreed to pay, and the Board of Directors approved
the payment of, approximately $14million to Evercore upon
the successful closing of the transaction. The agreement also
contained standard terms and conditions. We closed the
Murrays transaction on December19, 2005. In May
2006, the Board of Directors approved the Companys entry
into a separate agreement with Evercore for financial advisory
services in connection with our refinancing in fiscal 2006,
resulting in payments in fiscal 2006 to Evercore of
approximately $610,000.   During 2005, Maynard Jenkins, Chairman of the Board of Directors
and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, performed consulting
services for an unaffiliated entity relating to a proposed
acquisition for which he was paid a fee of $250,000. When he
accepted the consulting engagement, Mr.Jenkins did not
recall that his employment agreement with the Company which
initially was executed in 1998requires prior approval by
the Board of any outside work for compensation. In early 2006,
this matter was raised by Mr.Jenkins with the Board and
the Board requested, and Mr.Jenkins agreed, that he remit
the after-tax proceeds of the consulting fee to the Company. As
a result, in March, 2006, Mr.Jenkins paid to the Company
the amount of $147,060.

Committee Investigation and Restatement of the Consolidated
Financial Statements   Overview   In its 2005
10-K, the
Companys consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2004
and 2003 and quarterly information for the first three quarterly
periods in fiscal 2005 and all of fiscal 2004 were restated to

referred to herein as the Audit Committee-led
investigation and other accounting errors and
irregularities identified by the Company in the course of the
restatement process, all as more fully described in the
Background section below.   The Audit Committee concluded that the errors and irregularities
were primarily the result of actions directed by certain
personnel and an ineffective control environment that, among
other things, permitted the following to occur   
recording of improper accounting entries as directed by certain
personnel   
inappropriate override of, or interference with, existing
policies, procedures and internal controls   
withholding of information from, and providing of improper

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   In September 2006, upon the substantial conclusion of the Audit
Committee-led investigation, the Company announced the
departures of the Companys President and Chief Operating
Officer, Chief Administrative Officer who, until October 2005,
served as the Companys Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer and several other individuals including its
Controller within the Companys Finance organization.   Management, with the assistance of numerous experienced
accounting consultants other than its firm of independent
registered public accountants that the Company had retained
near the onset of the investigation to assist the then new Chief
Financial Officer with the restatement efforts, continued to
review the Companys accounting practices and identified
additional errors and irregularities that were corrected in the
restatements.   Background   In the Companys 2004 Annual Report on
Form10-K
for fiscal 2004, filed May2, 2005 the 2004
10-K,
management concluded that the Company did not maintain effective
internal control over financial reporting as of January30,
2005 due to the existence of material weaknesses as described in
the 2004
10-K. The
plan for remediation at that time called for, among other
things, the Company to enhance staffing and capabilities in its
Finance organization. During fiscal 2005, we made several
enhancements to our Finance organization including the October
2005 hiring of a new Senior Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer, Mr. James Riley. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005,
new personnel in our Finance organization raised questions
regarding the existence of inventory underlying certain general
ledger account balances, and an internal audit of vendor
allowances raised additional concerns about the processing and
collections of vendor allowances. Managements review of
these matters continued into our fiscal 2005year-end
financial closing. In early March 2006, it became apparent that
inventories and vendor allowances were potentially misstated and
that the effect was potentially material to the Companys
previously issued consolidated financial statements. The Audit
Committee, acting through a Special Investigation Committee
appointed by the Audit Committee consisting of the Audit
Committee Chairman and the Companys designated Presiding
Director, retained independent legal counsel who, in turn,
retained a nationally recognized accounting firm, other than the
Companys independent registered public accountants, to
assist it in conducting an independent investigation relative to
accounting errors and irregularities, relating primarily to the
Companys historical accounting for its inventories and
vendor allowances.   On March23, 2006, the Audit Committee concluded that, due
to accounting errors and irregularities then noted, the
Companys ifiscal 2004 consolidated financial
statements, as well as its consolidated financial statements for
fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, iiselected
consolidated financial data for each of the five years in the
period ended January30, 2005, iiiinterim financial
information for each of its quarters in fiscal 2003 and fiscal
2004 included in its 2004 Annual Report, and ivinterim
financial statements included in its
Form10-Qs
for the first three quarterly periods of fiscal 2005, should no
longer be relied upon. On March27, 2006, the Company
announced that it would be postponing the release of its fourth
quarter and fiscal 2005 financial results pending the outcome of
the Audit Committee-led investigation; that it would be
restating historical financial statements; and that the
Companys consolidated financial statements for the prior
interim periods and fiscal years indicated above should no
longer be relied upon.   The initial and primary focus of the Audit Committee-led
investigation was the Companys accounting for inventory
and for vendor allowances associated with its merchandising
programs. However, the Audit Committee did not limit the scope
of the investigation in any respect, which was subsequently
broadened to encompass other potential concerns raised during
the course of the investigation. Throughout and upon completion
of the investigation, representatives of the Audit Committee and
its legal and accounting advisors shared the results of the
investigation with the Companys independent registered
public accounting firm and the SEC, which is conducting a formal
investigation of these matters. As noted above, the Company
continues to share information and believes it is cooperating
fully with the SEC in its formal investigation.   During and following the Audit Committee-led investigation, the
Companys Finance personnel consisting primarily of the
Companys then new Chief Financial Officer, Mr.Riley,
and numerous experienced finance   
99 Table of Contents   CSK AUTO
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   accounting consultants the Company had retained near the onset
of the investigation to assist Mr.Riley with the
restatement efforts, assisted by the Companys Internal
Audit staff, conducted
follow-up
procedures to ensure that the information uncovered during the
investigation was complete, evaluated the initial accounting for
numerous transactions and reviewed the activity in accounts in
light of the newly available information to determine the
propriety of the initial record-keeping and accounting. In the
course of these
follow-up
procedures, the Company also identified a number of other
accounting errors and irregularities that were corrected in our
restated consolidated financial statements in our 2005
10-K.   The legal and accounting advisors to the Audit Committee, from
March through the end of September 2006, reviewed relevant
documentation and interviewed current and former officers and
employees of the Company. The investigation and restatement
process identified numerous instances of improperly supported
journal entries recorded to general ledger accounts, override of
Company policies and procedures, absence of appropriately
designed policies and procedures, misapplication of GAAP and
other ineffective controls. In addition, the investigation
identified evidence of both a tone among certain
senior executives of the Company that discouraged the raising of
accounting concerns and other behavior that was deemed to not be
acceptable by our disinterested directors i.e., the five of our
directors, including the members of the Special Investigation
Committee, who are not present or former members of our
management hereinafter, the Disinterested
Directors.   On September28, 2006, the Company announced the
substantial completion of the Audit Committee-led investigation,
and that the investigation had identified accounting errors and
irregularities that materially and improperly impacted various
inventory accounts, vendor allowance receivables, other accrual
accounts and related expense accounts. In addition to the
personnel changes discussed above, the Company also announced
its intent to implement remedial measures in the areas of
enhanced accounting policies, internal controls and employee
training.   The Audit Committee-led investigation and restatement process
resulted in legal, accounting consultant and audit expenses of
approximately $257million in fiscal 2006. Legal,
accounting consultant and audit expenses relative to the SEC
investigation, completion of the restatement process relative
to the 2005
10-K filed
May1, 2007and completion of our fiscal 2006
delinquent filings have continued into the current fiscal year;
however, we do not expect such expenditures to be of the same
magnitude in the aggregate as those incurred in fiscal 2006
relative to the Audit Committee investigation and restatement
process.   Securities
ClassAction Litigation   On June 9 and 20, 2006, two shareholder class actions alleging
violations of the federal securities laws were filed in the
United States District Court for the District of Arizona against
the Company and four of its current and former officers: Maynard
Jenkins who is also a director, James Riley, Martin Fraser and
Don Watson collectively referred to as the
Defendants. The cases are entitled

DGC. The cases were consolidated on September18, 2006,
with the Communications Workers case as the lead case.
The consolidated actions have been brought on behalf of a
putative class of purchasers of CSK Auto Corporation stock
between March20, 2003 and April13, 2006, inclusive.
The consolidated amended complaint, filed on November30,
2006, alleged that the Defendants violated Section10b of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the
Exchange Act, and
Rule10b-5,
promulgated thereunder, as well as Section20a of the
Exchange Act. The consolidated amended complaint alleged that
Defendants issued false statements before and during the class
period about the Companys income, earnings and internal
controls, allegedly causing the Companys stock to trade at
artificially inflated prices during the class period. It sought
recovery of damages in an unspecified amount. The Defendants
filed motions to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint,
arguing that the plaintiffs failed to adequately plead
violations of the federal securities laws. The court issued an
order on March28, 2007 granting the motions to dismiss,
but allowing plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint. Plaintiffs
filed their Second Amended Complaint on May25, 2007,
alleging violations of Section10b of the Exchange Act
and Rule10b-5, promulgated   
100 Table of Contents   CSK AUTO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   thereunder, and Section20a of the Exchange Act, against
the same Defendants, except for James Riley, whom the plaintiffs
voluntarily dismissed. Defendants have until July13, 2007
to respond to the Second Amended Complaint and the Company
anticipates that it will file a motion to dismiss the Second
Amended Complaint prior to that date. This litigation is in its
early stages, and we cannot predict its outcome; however, it is
reasonably possible that the outcome could have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.   Shareholder
Derivative Litigation   On July31, 2006, a shareholder derivative suit was filed
in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona
against certain of CSKs current and former officers and
all current and certain former directors. The Company is a
nominal defendant. On March2, 2007, plaintiff filed an
amended derivative complaint. The amended derivative complaint
alleged claims under Section304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 and for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties, abuse of
control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, and
unjust enrichment. The amended derivative complaint sought,
purportedly on behalf of the Company, damages, restitution, and
equitable and injunctive relief. The Company filed a motion to
dismiss arguing that plaintiff failed to plead facts
establishing that plaintiff was excused from making a demand on
the Companys board of directors to pursue these claims.
The individual defendants joined in the Companys motion.
While the motion to dismiss was pending, plaintiff filed a
motion for leave to amend her complaint. On June11, 2007,
the court granted plaintiff leave to amend and plaintiff filed
her Second Amended Complaint, which alleges the same claims as
the prior complaint, but adds various supporting allegations. On
June22, 2007, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the
Second Amended Complaint for failure to plead demand futility
adequately or, in the alternative, to stay the case until the
shareholder class action litigation is resolved. The individual
defendants joined in the Companys motion. No hearing date
has been scheduled and the Company does not anticipate a ruling
until at least August 2007. This litigation is also in its early
stages, and we cannot predict its outcome.   SEC
Investigation   The SEC is conducting an investigation related to certain
historical accounting practices of the Company. On
November27, 2006, the SEC served a subpoena on the Company
seeking the production of documents from the period
January1, 1997 to the date of the subpoena related
primarily to the types of matters identified in the Audit
Committee-led investigation, including internal controls and
accounting for inventories and vendor allowances. The Company
produced documents in response to the subpoena on a rolling
basis. On December5, 2006, the SEC also served subpoenas
on current and former Company officers Maynard Jenkins, Martin
Fraser and Don Watson. Additionally, the SEC has served
subpoenas for documents and testimony on various current and
former CSK employees. The Companys Audit Committee has
shared with the SEC the conclusions of the Audit Committee-led
investigation. At this time, we cannot predict when the SEC
investigation will be completed or what its outcome will be.   Other
Litigation   During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we received
notification from the State of California Board of Equalization
the Board of an assessment for approximately
$12million for sales tax and approximately
$06million for related interest based on the Boards
audit findings for the tax periods of October 1997 through
September 2000. During this time period, we refunded the sales
tax associated with battery cores to customers who returned a
battery core to our stores. The Board believed that the sales
tax associated with the battery cores should have been remitted
to the taxing authority rather than refunded to the customers.
On February6, 2006, we received notification from the
Board that their position had changed and they were no longer
seeking payment of any of the original assessment.   In a separate matter, on October13, 2006, the Board issued
its Notice of Determination for the period January1, 2001
through January4, 2004 seeking from us $666,386, including
tax, interest and penalties. Less than half of that   
101 Table of Contents   CSK AUTO
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   amount related to sales tax on returned battery cores. During
this period, we changed our business practices to not refund to
customers the sales tax associated with battery cores returned
by them to our stores, which is the position advocated by the
Board. The Company expensed and paid in fiscal 2006
approximately $375,000 with respect to other items of the
assessment and filed a Petition for Redetermination with respect
to the sales tax associated with battery cores. Based on the
Boards determination relative to the previous assessment
described above, the Company does not believe it has liability
for the portion of the assessment relating to the sales tax
associated with returned battery cores.   We were served on October26, 2004 with a lawsuit that was
filed in the Superior Court in SanDiego, California. The
case was brought by a former sales associate in California who
resigned in January 2003, and purports to be a class action on
behalf of all current and former California hourly store
employees claiming that plaintiff and those similarly situated
were not paid for: iall time worked i.e. off the
clock work, iithe minimum reporting time pay when
they reported to work a second time in a day, iiiall
overtime due, ivall wages due at termination, and
vamounts due for late or missed meal periods or rest
breaks. Plaintiff also alleges that we violated certain record
keeping requirements arising out of the foregoing alleged
violations. The lawsuit iclaims these alleged practices
are unfair business practices, iirequests back pay,
restitution, penalties for violations of various Labor Code
sections and for failure to pay all wages due on termination,
and interest for the last four years, plus attorney fees, and
iiirequests that the Company be enjoined from committing
further unfair business practices. The Company believed it had
meritorious defenses to all of these claims and defended the
claims vigorously. In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the
court refused the plaintiffs request to certify the class.
We subsequently settled the plaintiffs individual claim
for a nominal amount and the suit was dismissed.   We currently and from time to time are involved in other
litigation incidental to the conduct of our business, including
but not limited to asbestos and similar product liability
claims, slip and fall and other general liability claims,
discrimination and employment claims, vendor disputes, and
miscellaneous environmental and real estate claims. The damages
claimed in some of this litigation are substantial. Based on
internal review, we accrue reserves using our best estimate of
the probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities. We
do not currently believe that any of these other legal claims
incidental to the conduct of our business, individually or in
the aggregate, will result in liabilities material to our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   the date of disposition. In some of these cases, we are
indemnified by or have recourse to an unrelated third party for
claims arising from any such contamination, and also, or in the
alternative, have insurance coverage that may be available to
offset the potential cost of the indemnity obligation. We also
indemnify third party landlords under most of our store leases
against claims resulting from the occurrence of certain
triggering events or conditions arising out of our operations
from the leased premises. We enter into various other agreements
with unrelated parties in the ordinary course of our business,
which may include indemnity obligations relating to a triggering
event, or condition, which is, in most cases, based on our
future performance. In some cases, the indemnity obligations are
triggered by our prior acts or third parties future
performance, but are otherwise not limited in duration or
monetary exposure. However, in such instances, we have
determined that the likelihood of occurrence of the triggering
event is remote
and/or that
the potential cost to us of performance of the indemnity would
not be material.   Our risk management philosophy is to limit risk in any
transaction or relationship to the maximum extent reasonable in
relation to commercial and other considerations. Before
accepting any indemnity obligation, we make an informed risk
management decision considering, among other things, the
remoteness of the possibility that the triggering event will
occur, the potential costs to perform any resulting indemnity
obligation, possible actions to reduce the likelihood of a
triggering event or to reduce the costs of performing an
indemnity obligation, whether we are in fact indemnified by an
unrelated third party, insurance coverage that may be available
to offset the cost of the indemnity obligation, and the benefits
to us from the transaction or relationship.   Because most of our indemnity obligations are not limited in
duration or potential monetary exposure, we cannot calculate the
maximum potential amount of future payments that could be paid
under our indemnity obligations stemming from all our existing
agreements. We also accrue for contingent liabilities, including
those arising out of indemnity obligations, when a loss is
probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. We are not
aware of the occurrence of any triggering event or condition
that would have a material adverse impact on our financial
statements as a result of an indemnity obligation relating to
such triggering event or condition.   We have issued standby letters of credit related to insurance
coverage, lease obligations and other matters that expire during
fiscal 2007. As of February4, 2007, total amounts
committed under these letters of credit were $375million,
which consists of $341million of stand-by letters of
credit and $34million of commercial letters of credit.   
Note19
Subsequent
Events   On April27, 2007, we entered into an amendment to our
$350million Term Loan Facility entered into in June 2006
that increased the maximum leverage ratio permitted under the
facility in order to minimize the possibility that we would be
unable to comply with the facilitys leverage ratio
covenant for the first two quarters of fiscal 2007 and revised
the definition of the term Leverage Ratio to exclude
undrawn letters of credit, which had typically been excluded
from this calculation in our prior debt agreements.   On June11, 2007, we entered into a third waiver to our
Senior Credit Facility that extended the then current waiver
relating to the delivery thereunder of our delinquent periodic
SEC filings and related financial statements until the earliest
of iAugust15, 2007, iithe filing with the
SEC of all such delinquent SEC filings up to and including our
form10-Q

periodic SEC filings that are delinquent by June30, 2007,

Quarterly
Results unaudited   Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest
sales occurring in the months of June through October
overlapping our second and third fiscal quarters. In addition,
our business is affected by weather conditions. While unusually
severe or inclement weather tends to reduce sales as customers
are more likely to defer elective maintenance during such
periods, extremely hot and cold temperatures tend to enhance
sales by causing auto parts to fail and sales of seasonal
products to increase.   The following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited
operating data for fiscal 2006 and 2005. The unaudited quarterly
information includes all adjustments which management considers
necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown.
Please note the sum of the quarterly earnings loss per share
amounts within a fiscal year may differ from the total earnings
loss per share for the fiscal year due to the impact of
differing weighted average share outstanding calculations.

COMMITTEE INVESTIGATION AND RESTATEMENT OF THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   Overview   In its 2005
10-K, the
Companys consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2004
and 2003 and quarterly financial information for the first three
quarterly periods in fiscal 2005 and all of fiscal 2004 included
in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data, were restated to correct errors and irregularities
of the type identified in the Audit Committee-led investigation
primarily focused in the Companys accounting for
inventory and vendor allowances and other accounting errors and
irregularities identified by the Company in the course of the
restatement process, all more fully described in the
Background section below.   The Audit Committee concluded that the errors and irregularities
were primarily the result of actions directed by certain
personnel and an ineffective control environment that, among
other things, permitted the following to occur   
recording of improper accounting entries as directed by certain
personnel   
inappropriate override of, or interference with, existing
policies, procedures and internal controls   
withholding information from, and providing of improper
explanations and supporting documentation to, the Companys
Audit Committee and Board of Directors, as well as its internal
auditors and independent registered public accountants;and   
discouraging employees from raising accounting related concerns
and suppressing accounting related inquiries that were made.   In September 2006, upon the substantial conclusion of the Audit
Committee-led investigation, the Company announced the
departures of the Companys President and Chief Operating
Officer, Chief Administrative Officer who, until October 2005,
served as the Companys Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer and several other individuals including its
Controller within the Companys Finance organization.   Management, with the assistance of numerous experienced
accounting consultants other than its firm of independent
registered public accountants that the Company had retained
near the onset of the investigation to assist the then new Chief
Financial Officer with the restatement efforts, continued to
review the Companys accounting practices and identified
additional errors and irregularities, which were corrected in
the restatement and are included in the discussion under
Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting presented below.   Background   In the Companys 2004
10-K,
management concluded that the Company did not maintain effective
internal control over financial reporting as of January30,
2005 due to the existence of material weaknesses as described in
the 2004
10-K. The
plan for remediation at that time called for, among other
things, the Company to enhance staffing and capabilities in its
Finance organization. During fiscal 2005, we made several
enhancements to our Finance organization including the October
2005 hiring of a new Senior Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer, Mr.James Riley. In the fourth quarter of 2005,
new personnel in our Finance organization raised questions
regarding the existence of inventory underlying certain general
ledger account balances, and an internal audit of vendor
allowances raised additional concerns about the processing and
collections of vendor allowances. Managements review of
these matters continued into our fiscal 2005year-end
financial closing process. In early March 2006, it became
apparent that inventories and vendor allowances were potentially
misstated and that the effect was potentially material to the
Companys previously issued consolidated financial
statements. The Audit Committee, acting through a Special
Investigation Committee appointed by the Audit Committee
consisting of the Audit   
106 Table of Contents   Committee Chairman and the Companys designated Presiding
Director, retained independent legal counsel who, in turn,
retained a nationally recognized accounting firm, other than the
Companys independent registered public accountants, to
assist it in conducting an independent investigation relative to
accounting errors and irregularities, relating primarily to the
Companys historical accounting for its inventories and
vendor allowances.   On March23, 2006, the Audit Committee concluded that, due
to accounting errors and irregularities then noted, the
Companys ifiscal 2004 consolidated financial
statements, as well as its consolidated financial statements for
fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, iiselected
consolidated financial data for each of the five years in the
period ended January30, 2005, iiiinterim financial
information for each of its quarters in fiscal 2003 and fiscal
2004 included in its 2004 Annual Report, and ivinterim
financial statements included in its
Form10-Qs
for the first three quarterly periods of fiscal 2005, should no
longer be relied upon. On March27, 2006, the Company
announced that it would be postponing the release of its fourth
quarter and fiscal 2005 financial results pending the outcome of
the Audit Committee-led investigation; that it would be
restating historical financial statements; and that the
Companys consolidated financial statements for the prior
interim periods and fiscal years indicated above should no
longer be relied upon.   The initial and primary focus of the Audit Committee-led
investigation was the Companys accounting for inventory
and for vendor allowances associated with its merchandising
programs. However, the Audit Committee did not limit the scope
of the investigation in any respect, which was subsequently
broadened to encompass other potential concerns raised during
the course of the investigation. Throughout and upon completion
of the investigation, representatives of the Audit Committee and
its legal and accounting advisors shared the results of the
investigation with the Companys independent registered
public accounting firm and the SEC, which is conducting a formal
investigation of these matters. As noted above, the Company
continues to share information and believes it is cooperating
fully with the SEC in its formal investigation.   During and following the Audit Committee-led investigation, the
Companys Finance personnel consisting primarily of the
Companys then new Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Riley, and
numerous experienced finance/accounting consultants the Company
had retained near the onset of the investigation to assist Mr.
Riley with the restatement efforts, assisted by the
Companys Internal Audit staff, conducted
follow-up
procedures to ensure that the information uncovered during the
investigation was complete, evaluated the initial accounting for
numerous transactions and reviewed the activity in accounts in
light of the newly available information to determine the
propriety of the initial record-keeping and accounting. In the
course of these
follow-up
procedures, the Company identified a number of other accounting
errors and irregularities, all of which were corrected in our
restated consolidated financial statements in our 2005
10-K.   The legal and accounting advisors to the Audit Committee spent
thousands of hours in the period from March through the end of
September 2006 reviewing relevant documentation and interviewing
current and former officers and employees of the Company. The
investigation and restatement process identified numerous
instances of improperly supported journal entries recorded to
general ledger accounts, override of Company policies and
procedures, absence of appropriately designed policies and
procedures, misapplication of GAAP and other ineffective
controls. In addition, the investigation identified evidence of
both a tone among certain senior executives of the
Company that discouraged the raising of accounting concerns and
other behavior that was deemed to not be acceptable by our
Disinterested Directors.   On September28, 2006, the Company announced the
substantial completion of the Audit Committee-led investigation,
and that the investigation had identified accounting errors and
irregularities that materially and improperly impacted various
inventory accounts, vendor allowance receivables, other accrual
accounts and related expense accounts. The Company also
announced that its President and Chief Operating Officer, Chief
Administrative Officer who, until October 2005, had served as
the Companys Senior Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer and several other individuals within the Companys
Finance area including its Controller were no longer employed
by the Company. The Company also announced its intent to
implement remedial measures in the areas of enhanced accounting
policies, internal controls and employee training.   Following the completion of the Audit Committee-led
investigation, the Board of Directors created a Remediation
Committee comprised of certain positions within key functional
areas of the Company and
co-chaired
by our Senior Vice President and General Counsel and Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer to develop   
107 Table of Contents   a remediation plan to address the types of matters identified
during the investigation. The proposed remediation plan that the
Remediation Committee is working with reflects the input of the
Disinterested Directors. While presently in the development
phase, this remediation plan is generally expected to include a
comprehensive review, and development or modification as
appropriate, of various components of the Companys
compliance program, including ethics and compliance training,
hotline awareness and education, corporate governance training,
awareness of and education relative to key codes and policies,
as well as departmental specific measures. See Plan for
Remediation of Material Weaknesses below.   The Audit Committee-led investigation and restatement process
resulted in legal, accounting consultant and audit expenses of
approximately $257million in fiscal 2006. Legal,
accounting consultant and audit expenses relative to the SEC
investigation, completion of the restatement process relative
to the 2005
10-K filed
May1, 2007and completion of our fiscal 2006
delinquent filings have continued into the current fiscal year;
however, we do not expect such expenditures to be of the same
magnitude in the aggregate as those incurred in fiscal 2006
relative to the Audit Committee investigation and restatement
process.   DISCLOSURE
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as such
term is defined in
Rule13a-15e
under the Exchange Act was performed as of February4,
2007, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our current Chief Executive Officer and
current interim Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Steven Korby. Our
disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure
that information we are required to disclose in our reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the
SECs rules and forms and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosures.   Based on this evaluation, our current Chief Executive Officer
and our current interim Chief Financial Officer, Mr.Steven
Korby, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective as of February4, 2007 because of the
material weaknesses described below. The Company performed
additional analyses and other post-closing procedures to ensure
that our consolidated financial statements contained within this
Annual Report were prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Accordingly, management believes that the consolidated financial
statements included in this Annual Report fairly present in all
material respects our financial position, results of operations
and cash flows for the periods presented.   MANAGEMENTS
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as defined in
Rules13a-15f
and
15d-15f
under the Exchange Act and for the assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The
Companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP. The Companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that   ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company   iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the
Company;and   iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention, or
timely detection, of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   
108 Table of Contents   Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including our current Chief Executive Officer and current Chief
Financial Officer, we conducted an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of February4, 2007. In making this
assessment, management used the criteria set forth in the
framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO
entitled Internal Control-Integrated Framework.   A material weakness is a control deficiency, or
combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a
remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
A control deficiency exists when the design or
operation of a control does not allow management or employees,
in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to
prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.   Management identified the following material weaknesses in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
February4, 2007   1Control Environment: The Company did
not maintain an effective control environment based on the
criteria established in the COSO framework. The Company failed
to design controls to prevent or detect instances of
inappropriate override of, or interference with, existing
policies, procedures and internal controls. The Company did not
establish and maintain a proper tone as to internal control over
financial reporting. More specifically, senior management failed
to emphasize, through consistent communication and behavior, the
importance of internal control over financial reporting and
adherence to the Companys code of business conduct and
ethics, which, among other things, resulted in information being
withheld from, and improper explanations and inadequate
supporting documentation being provided to, the Companys
Audit Committee, its Board of Directors, its internal auditors
and independent registered public accountants. In addition,
certain members of senior management created an environment that
discouraged employees from raising accounting related concerns
and suppressed accounting related inquiries that were made.   The material weakness in the Companys control environment
discussed above permitted or contributed to the following
additional material weaknesses and the material weakness
described at 2below   aAccounting for Inventory The
Companys lack of effective controls did not prevent or
detect the inappropriate override of established procedures
regarding the adjustment of inventories for the results of
annual physical inventory counts at each of the Companys
distribution centers, warehouses and stores. In addition, the
Companys lack of effective controls did not prevent or
detect inappropriate and inaccurate accumulations of inventory
balances in in-transit accounts i.e., store returns to
warehouses, distribution centers and return centers; and to
vendors, which was known or should have been known to several
members of the Finance organization. The lack of effective
controls permitted ierrors in inventory balances to be
inappropriately systematically amortized to cost of sales in
improper periods; iiinstances where improper adjustments
were made to certain product costs within the perpetual
inventory system that, together with improper journal entries to
the general ledger, resulted in the overstatement of inventory
and cost of sales being recognized in incorrect periods; and
iiithe inappropriate capitalization of inventory
overheads purchasing, warehousing and distribution costs and
vendor allowance receivables. Additionally, Company personnel
did not properly oversee the processes for accounting for
inventory warranties and did not establish adequate accrued
liabilities for warranty returns from customers.   bAccounting for Vendor Allowances The
Companys lack of effective controls did not detect or
prevent the inappropriate override of established procedures
related to: ithe review and approval process for initial
vendor allowance agreements; iithe monitoring of
modifications to existing vendor allowance agreements; and
iiithe accuracy of recording of various vendor allowance
transactions, including applicable cash collections and
estimates. Furthermore, as a result of the lack of a sufficient
complement of personnel with the requisite level of accounting
knowledge, experience and training in GAAP, as discussed in
2below, the Company did not identify that provisions in
certain agreements were required to be accounted for
differently. The investigation revealed that improper debits
were issued and applied to accounts payable for amounts the
Company was not entitled to receive. These amounts were
subsequently repaid to those vendors through direct cash
payments, the foregoing of future cash   
109 Table of Contents   discounts, the acceptance of increased prices on future
purchases and paybacks through the warranty account. This
material weakness resulted in errors in vendor allowance
receivables, inventory, accounts payable and costs of sales
accounts.   cAccounting for Certain Accrued Expenses The
Companys lack of effective controls did not prevent or
detect the inappropriate override of established procedures to
adjust workers compensation liabilities to amounts
determined by independent actuaries. Errors in timing of
incentive compensation accruals resulted from inadvertent
misapplication of GAAP as well as the lack of effective controls
which permitted override of established procedures. In addition,
the Company identified improper and unsupported journal entries
to the general ledger that resulted in the misstatement of
certain accrued expense accounts and related operating and
administrative expenses. This material weakness resulted in
errors in certain accrued expenses and related operating and
administrative expenses, including workers compensation
liabilities and incentive compensation costs.   dAccounting for Store Fixtures and
Supplies The Companys lack of effective
controls did not prevent or detect the override of established
procedures for periodic physical inspections and usability
evaluations of store fixtures held for future use in a
warehouse. Specifically, the Company did not detect that certain
of these assets were impaired or did not exist and that, as a
result, their recorded cost was overstated. In addition, the
Companys controls failed to detect an inappropriate
accumulation of costs related to store fixtures and supplies in
general ledger accounts and the Companys overstatement of
supplies on hand in each store. This material weakness resulted
in errors in its store fixtures fixed assets and supplies
accounts other current assets and related operating and
administrative expenses.   2Resources, and Policies and Procedures to Ensure
Proper and Consistent Application of GAAP:The
Company did not maintain effective controls over the application
of GAAP. Specifically the Company failed to have a sufficient
complement of personnel with a level of accounting knowledge,
experience and training in the application of GAAP commensurate
with the Companys financial reporting requirements. This
material weakness in the Companys resources and policies
contributed to the following additional material weaknesses   aAccounting for Leases The Company did
not maintain effective controls over the completeness and
accuracy of its accounting for lease related fixed assets and
debt, related operating and administrative expenses and interest
expense, and financial statement disclosures. Specifically, the
Company did not detect that a vehicle master leasing arrangement
was not properly evaluated under GAAP.   bAllowance for Sales Returns The
Company did not maintain effective controls over the
completeness of its allowance for sales returns and the related
net sales, cost of sales, accrued liabilities and other current
assets accounts. Specifically, the Company did not detect that
it had inappropriately excluded an estimate for certain returns
that were incorrectly classified as warranty and core returns in
the Companys methodology for determining an allowance for
sales returns.   cAccounting for Certain Accrued
Expenses The Company did not maintain effective
controls over the completeness, valuation and reporting in the
proper period of certain of its accrued expense accounts and
related operating and administrative expenses. The Company
identified numerous instances of errors in accrual accounts,
including transactions not accounted for in accordance with
GAAP, that were attributable to the Companys lack of a
sufficient complement of experienced personnel and written
accounting policies and procedures in certain areas.   Each of the aforementioned material weaknesses resulted in
adjustments to the Companys fiscal 2006 and 2005 annual
and interim consolidated financial statements, and the
restatement of our fiscal 2004 annual consolidated financial
statements and interim consolidated financial statements for
each of the first three quarters in fiscal 2005. In addition,
each of these above material weaknesses could result in a
material misstatement of the Companys interim or annual
consolidated financial statements and disclosures that would not
be prevented or detected.   
110 Table of Contents   Management has concluded that due to the aforementioned material
weaknesses, the Company did not maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting as of February4, 2007
based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO.   Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
February4, 2007 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated
in their report which appears under Item8 of this Annual
Report.   PLAN FOR
REMEDIATION OF MATERIAL WEAKNESSES   Remediation
Initiatives   The Board of Directors created a Remediation Committee comprised
of certain positions within key functional areas of the Company
and co-chaired by the Senior Vice President and General Counsel
and the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to
develop a remediation plan to address the material weaknesses
and other deficiencies noted from the results of the Audit
Committee-led investigation and completion of the Companys
evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting. The
proposed remediation plan that the Remediation Committee is
working with reflects the input of the Disinterested Directors.
While most aspects of the plan are presently in the development
phase, the remediation plan is generally expected to include a
comprehensive review, and development or modification as
appropriate, of various components of the Companys
compliance program, including ethics and compliance training,
hotline awareness and education, corporate governance training,
awareness of and education relative to key codes of business
conduct and policies, as well as departmental specific measures.   To remediate the material weaknesses described above, the
Company has implemented or plans to implement the remedial
measures described below. In addition, the Company plans to
continue its evaluation of its controls and procedures and may,
in the future, implement additional enhancements.   1.Control Environment:The
Companys failure to maintain an adequate control
environment and have appropriate staffing resources contributed
significantly to each of the material weaknesses described above
and the Companys inability to prevent or detect material
errors in its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
The Company has completed or is in the process of completing the
following remediation measures   General Personnel changes in key positions in
management have been made, which has improved the overall tone
within the organization and which represented the first and most
critical step in establishing an environment conducive to
maintaining an adequate control environment.   The Company has reinforced and plans to continue to reinforce on
a regular basis with its employees the importance of raising any
concerns, whether they are related to financial reporting,
compliance with the Companys ethics policies or otherwise,
and using the existing communication tools available to them,
including the Companys hotline. The training planned by
the Remediation Committee and the hiring of new personnel in
conjunction with the new controls are expected to foster an
environment that should facilitate the questioning of accounting
procedures and reinforce the ability and expectation of
employees to raise issues to the Board of Directors if their
questions or concerns are not resolved to their satisfaction.   We plan to provide education and training to our management on
an ongoing, periodic basis with respect to, among other things,
corporate governance, compliance and SOX. Such education and
training are planned to include iin-house memoranda and
other written materials, as well as presentation and discussion
in management meetings, and iimodules/tutorials offered
within the curriculum provided by a third party ethics and
compliance vendor. The Company recently completed its evaluation
of third party providers of ethics and compliance training for
all of its employees and is in the process of contracting with
its selected provider. Such training is planned to be ongoing
and include tailored programs focused on the Companys
codes of conduct and ethics as well as, e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley,
conflicts of interest, insider trading, corporate governance,
financial integrity, and targeted training geared toward certain
functional areas on such topics as vendor arrangements,
advertising and merchandising and procurement integrity.   
111 Table of Contents   Formalized closing procedures are being enhanced to provide for
the proper preparation of account reconciliations and their
independent review and approval. The Company has extended its
SOX 404 sub-certification process used to support the SOX
certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer to additional members of management and,
depending upon new hires and related organizational changes, may
extend to others within the organization to assist in the
disclosures to be included in, and the review of, our SEC
filings.   The Company also is automating certain procedures so that it
will be easier to ascertain if there is unusual activity in its
ledgers and is introducing new security to its business systems
to place limits on the ability to make journal entries to
specific cost centers and accounts to authorized individuals.
The journal entry preparation and review and approval process
has been enhanced to require imaging of manual journal entries
and supporting documentation. Each individual who prepares
journal entries will be reminded that they are responsible to
ensure that adequate supporting documentation is attached. The
inclusion of this supporting documentation is intended to allow
the approver to more easily ascertain whether the entries are
correct. The Company is also addressing repetitive manual
journal entries and plans to automate where appropriate to
reduce the volume of manual entries currently required.   Accounting for Inventory The Company has
instituted monitoring processes to ensure compliance with its
established policies to assure timely reconciliations of all
physical inventories and reflection of the results of the
reconciliations in the general ledger, as well as independent
supervisory review of the reconciliations. Review and approval
processes are in place for distribution centers, warehouses and
stores to ensure inventory shrink estimates are calculated in
accordance with established procedures. Although new personnel
have already been hired with pertinent experience in accounting
for inventories, additional hires in the inventory area are
planned due to turnover. We plan to enhance our reconciliation
process of the book and perpetual inventory for each reporting
period to mitigate the risk of material unsubstantiated balances
accumulating in general ledger accounts. Longer term, we expect
to make system enhancements so that our book and perpetual
systems function as one system that is used to replenish the
operations and utilize the same information to account for on
hand merchandise inventory and cost of sales. Currently, the
Company uses an estimation technique for determining its
in-transit inventory rather than halting operations to enable a
physical inventory of in-transit merchandise to be conducted.
This estimate is reviewed and approved on a quarterly basis. In
the future, the Company expects to make modifications to its
systems that will allow for a systematic method of determining
the in-transit inventory balances. Access to product cost
adjustments in our inventory system has now been appropriately
restricted. We plan to enhance the approvals required for such
adjustments and require a monthly manager level review of all
adjustments entered into our system. In connection with the
restatement of inventory and cost of sales for warranty, the
Company has developed a more rigorous process for the
independent review of the methodology and underlying judgments
used in developing the estimates that underlie the accrual.   Accounting for Vendor Allowances The
Companys actions and planned remediation measures intended
to address material weaknesses related to its vendor allowance
receivable accounts and the related inventory, accounts payable
and cost of sales accounts include the following   
The Company has enhanced its review and approval processes to
ensure review by appropriate members of management of critical
information necessary to assess vendor allowance collections and
the proper recognition of vendor allowances in the appropriate
periods.   
The Company plans to reevaluate and enhance its contract review
process, including training of merchandising, finance and legal
staffs, as well as formalizing the communication process among
the three groups, to better provide for timely identification of
potential issues and accurate accounting treatment. The Company
also plans to implement enhanced processes and procedures so
that its merchandising, finance and legal staffs have adequate
information to conduct their review and provide meaningful input
and communication during the contract negotiation process to
allow for accurate accounting treatment for both standard and
non-standard contracts.   
112 Table of Contents   
The Company plans to conduct training for its merchandising,
finance and legal staffs relative to vendor arrangements,
including contract provisions and construction, the impact of
amendments and side and ancillary agreements and accounting
treatment of related vendor allowances.   
The Company has consolidated the oversight and accounting for
all vendor allowance financial transactions under one senior
accounting manager to provide for consistent application with
respect to the accounting for vendor allowances.   Accounting for Certain Accrued Expenses The
Companys planned remediation measures intended to address
the material weakness related to the Companys recording of
accrued expenses include the development of a standardized
checklist of expected accrual items and the implementation of a
process of enhanced review of invoices, disbursements and other
items at the end of each quarter to provide for proper recording
of accrued expenses and liabilities. In addition, we believe
that the formal review procedures for period end closings and
account reconciliations and the hiring of new Finance
organization management, along with written policies and
procedures, should remediate this material weakness. The
aforementioned remediation efforts are also designed to
eliminate the ability to override policies and procedures and
internal controls.   Accounting for Store Fixtures and Supplies
The Company has already closed its fixtures warehouse and moved
useable materials where they are under perpetual inventory
control. Unusable materials have been scrapped and general
ledger balances have been appropriately adjusted. The Company
plans to conduct an annual review of the items in its fixtures
inventory to ensure they continue to be usable in the
Companys operations. The Company has adjusted its store
supplies general ledger balances to appropriate amounts and
plans on monitoring these balances on a quarterly basis.   2.Resources and, Policies and Procedures to Ensure
Proper and Consistent Application of GAAP:Lack
of formalized written procedures contributed to the errors and
irregularities in the accounting records, as did the
Companys failure to have a sufficient complement of
personnel with a level of accounting knowledge, experience and
training in the application of GAAP commensurate with the
Companys financial reporting requirements. The Company has
completed or is in the process of completing the following
remediation measures   General The Company plans to prepare or
enhance formal written accounting policies and procedures and
establish procedures and processes for their periodic update. In
addition, Finance personnel job descriptions are being updated
to reflect current duties, and procedures are being written that
should provide for the ability to effectively audit compliance.
As discussed above, closing procedures are being enhanced to
ensure proper preparation, review and approval of account
reconciliations.   The Company has hired and plans to hire new Finance organization
personnel who will have knowledge, experience and training in
the application of GAAP to handle the Companys operations
and related financial reporting requirements. In view of the
resignation of our current Chief Financial Officer
CFO, as noted in PartI
Significant Events Management Changes above, we are
seeking a permanent CFO to succeed him; in addition, we are
seeking a new Controller. These personnel, along with a rigorous
monthly financial statement review and comparison of actual
results to budget, are intended to assist in substantiating that
our financial reporting is in compliance with GAAP and SEC rules
and regulations. The Company plans to increase the accounting,
internal control, and SEC reporting acumen of its Finance
organization personnel through a regular training program, which
is planned to include, among other things, in-house training and
education on corporate governance and compliance practices as
well as modules/tutorials offered within curriculum provided by
our third party ethics and compliance training vendor, which we
expect to select in the near future.   Beginning in the latter part of fiscal 2004, with the input of
Company management and the Chair of the Audit Committee, we
restructured our Internal Audit Department IAD and
augmented the IAD staff, and we developed and implemented a
risk-based internal audit plan and related audit
process/procedures, report structure and related materials to
govern the audit process going forward. We are in the process of
enlarging our IAD staff and plan to further increase the
IADs involvement in the financial reporting process, and
continue the development and implementation of risk-based master
internal audit plans, which will be re   
113 Table of Contents   assessed approximately annually and revised/updated based upon
changes in risk assessment or changed circumstances e.g.,
acquisitions.   Accounting for Leases The Companys
planned remediation measures to address the material weakness
related to the Companys accounting for leases include
additional training and the implementation of a process of
enhanced review of lease agreements and other contracts to
determine the proper accounting treatment.   Allowance for Sales Returns We have developed
a process to estimate sales returns using historical return
information that is all inclusive. We plan to enhance our
internal controls over the estimation process for the sales
return allowance by establishing a formal quarterly review of
this calculation.   Interim
Measures Pending Completion of Remediation
Initiatives   Management has not yet implemented all of the measures described
above or adequately tested those controls already implemented.
Nevertheless, management believes those remediation measures
already implemented, together with the additional measures
undertaken by the Company described below, satisfactorily
address the material weaknesses described above as they might
affect the consolidated financial statements and information
included in this Annual Report. These additional measures
included the following   
The fiscal 2006year-end reporting processes was extended,
allowing the Company to conduct additional analyses and
procedures and make additional adjustments as necessary to
ensure the accuracy of financial reporting through fiscal 2006.   
Where the Company identified the existence of a material
weakness, the Company has performed extensive substantive
procedures to ensure that affected amounts are fairly stated for
all periods presented in this Annual Report.   
The Company retained, on an interim basis, numerous experienced
accounting consultants, other than the Companys
independent registered public accounting firm, with relevant
accounting experience, skills and knowledge, working under the
supervision and direction of the Companys management, to
assist with the fiscal 2006year-end reporting process.   
The Company conducted a detailed and extensive review of account
reconciliations, non-routine transactions and agreements,
financial statement classifications, spreadsheets, and journal
entries and related substantiation for accuracy and conformance
with GAAP.   Control
deficiencies not constituting material weaknesses   In addition to the material weaknesses described above,
management has identified other deficiencies in internal control
over financial reporting that did not constitute material
weaknesses as of February4, 2007. The Company implemented
during fiscal 2006 and plans to implement during fiscal 2007
various measures to remediate these control deficiencies and has
undertaken other interim measures to address these control
deficiencies.   Managements
conclusions   Management believes the remediation measures described above
will strengthen the Companys internal control over
financial reporting and remediate the material weaknesses
identified above. Although management has not yet implemented
all of these measures or tested all those that have been
implemented, management has concluded that the interim measures
described above provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
Companys financial statements included in this Annual
Report and has discussed its conclusions with the Companys
Audit Committee.   The Company is committed to continuing to improve its internal
control processes and will continue to diligently and vigorously
review its disclosure controls and procedures and its internal
control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance
with the requirements of SOX 404. However, any control system,
regardless of how well designed, operated and evaluated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its
objectives will be met. As management continues to evaluate and
work to improve the Companys internal control   
114 Table of Contents   over financial reporting, it may determine to take additional
measures to address control deficiencies, and it may determine
not to complete certain of the measures described above.   CHANGES
IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company completed the
integration of the systems associated with its December 2005
acquisition of Murrays, which enabled us to have
standardized purchasing, accounting processes and internal
controls over financial reporting, which materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control
over financial reporting.
