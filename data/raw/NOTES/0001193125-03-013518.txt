INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT  The Board of Directors Sonic Solutions:  We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Sonic Solutions as of March 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related statements of operations,
shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2003. In connection with our audits of the financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule as listed in a2.
These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of Sonic Solutions management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sonic Solutions as of March 31, 2003 and 2002 and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.  /s/KPMG LLP  San Francisco, California May 1, 2003

SONIC SOLUTIONS  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS March 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003  1SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  aOperations  We develop and market computer based tools that enable the creation of digital audio and video titles in the CD-Audio and DVD-Video formats, and in
related formats. These tools are also used for recording data files on CD recordable or DVD recordable disks in the CD-ROM and DVD-ROM formats and for backing up the information contained on hard disks attached to computers. Most of the products we
sell consist entirely of computer software, though some of the tools we sell include plug-in computer hardware. We also license the software technology underlying our tools to various other companies to incorporate in products they
develop.  We divide our products into three categories:
Professional Audio and Video Products Our professional products consist of advanced DVD-Video creation tools which are intended for use by high-end professional customers. We
sell a number of products in this category including DVD Creator Macintosh based, Sonic Scenarist Windows based, DVD Producer Windows based, DVD Fusion Macintosh based and ReelDVD Windows based. These products include elaborate
applications software and, in some cases, plug-in hardware. Our customers use our professional products to prepare commercial quality DVD-Video titles, in many cases destined for mass replication and release to home video consumers.
Desktop Products Our desktop products include software-only DVD-Video creation tools and DVD-Video playback software intended for use by lower end professionals, by
enthusiasts or prosumers, and by consumers. Our desktop products also include software-only CD-Audio, CD-ROM and DVD-ROM making tools, as well as data backup software. We sell and market these products through product bundling
arrangements with OEM suppliers of related products, as well as through retail channels both web-based and traditional bricks and mortar channels. We market a number of different desktop products under various trade names including
RecordNow, Backup My PC, CinePlayer, DVDit! and MyDVD.  Technology Products This category includes software that we license to other companies for inclusion in their DVD or CD creation and recording products. We market most of
this software under the trade names of AuthorScript and Primo SDK.  On February 27, 2001, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Daikin Industries, Ltd., a Japanese corporation, whereby on that date we acquired The DVD Software Development Business of Daikin, also called
Daikin DVD. In return for the assets acquired, we issued 395,000 shares of Common Stock valued at $593,000 and 700,000 shares of Preferred Stock valued at $1,750,000. The acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting.
On March 21, 2002, we executed an agreement forming a new
company, Sonic Studio LLC in partnership with a limited liability corporation controlled by two individuals Eric Jorde and Jeff Wilson. Under the terms of the agreement, we transferred our SonicStudio workstation business to the SonicStudio
LLC, and licensed them to utilize the technology underlying SonicStudio in the professional audio workstation market. The total amount of net assets and liabilities transferred to the SonicStudio LLC, including receivables, inventory, fixed assets,
and net of customer service liabilities was $235,661. Certain employees transferred from Sonic to join the SonicStudio LLC.  Under the terms of the agreement, SonicStudio LLC compensated us for the Sonic Studio business with a three year note for $500,000. The note, which does
not carry interest, will be repaid to us with a percentage 
42 Table of Contents
royalty based on sales received by SonicStudio LLC, plus any share of profits paid to us by them. Once the note is retired, Sonic will continue to retain a
15% interest in SonicStudio LLC.  On May 24, 2002, we entered
into an agreement with Axeda, under which Axeda licensed Ravisents software DVD player and other digital media technologies to us. Under the agreement, we paid Axeda a one-time fee of $2 million for the license and related agreements, and in
return we obtained exclusive rights to deploy the Ravisent technologies in the personal computer market. As part of this agreement we acquired a revenue generating business, fixed assets, developed software and engineering employees.  On November 13, 2002, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with
VERITAS to acquire the business of the VERITAS Desktop Mobile Division DMD, which sold personal computer based CDROM, CD-Audio and DVD-ROM mastering software and personal computer backup software. The transactions contemplated
by the agreement were closed on December 18, 2002.  Under the
agreement with VERITAS we acquired all the software and other intellectual property required to carry on development and marketing of products sold by the DMD business, and we assumed essentially all of the DMD business outstanding customer
contracts and other contracts. Under this agreement almost all the employees of the DMD business approximately 40 individuals joined Sonic. Pursuant to this agreement we also entered into a sublease agreement with VERITAS for the principal offices
of the DMD business.  Under the asset purchase agreement, we
issued 1,290,948 shares of Series F Preferred Stock valued at $8,471,000 and convertible into 1,290,948 shares of our Common Stock subject to adjustment for stock splits and the like. Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement we entered into an
amended and restated registration rights agreement with VERITAS under which we provided registration rights for these shares once they were converted into shares of our Common Stock. In March, 2003, VERITAS converted all their shares of Series F
Preferred Stock into shares of our Common Stock.  bUse of Estimates and Certain Concentrations  We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Our management is also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the
reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to revenue recognition, the allowance for doubtful accounts, capitalized software, and other contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and various
other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on the specific circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  We
are dependent on sole-source suppliers for certain key components used in our products. We purchase these sole-source components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time. We do not carry significant inventories of these components, and
have no guaranteed supply agreements. Any extended future interruption or limitation in the supply of any of the components obtained from a single source could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  cRevenue Recognition  We recognize revenue in accordance with Statement of Position
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP 98-4 Deferral of the Effective Date of a Provision of SOP 97-2, and SOP 98-9, Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain
Arrangements and in certain instances in accordance with SOP 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts. SOP 97-2 generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving
multiple elements 
43 Table of Contents
such as software products, hardware, upgrades, enhancements, maintenance and support, installation and training to be allocated to each element based on the
relative fair values of the elements. The fair value of an element must be based on vendor-specific objective evidence.  We derive our software revenue primarily from licenses of our software products including any related hardware components, development agreements and
maintenance and support. Revenue recognized from multiple-element software arrangements is allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair values of elements, for example, the license to use software products versus maintenance and
support for the software product. The determination of fair value is based on objective evidence specific to us. Objective evidence of fair values of all elements of an arrangement is based upon our standard pricing and discounting practices for
those products and services when sold separately. Objective evidence of support services is measured by annual renewal rates. SOP 98-9 requires recognition of revenue using the residual method in a multiple element arrangement when fair
value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement. Under the residual method, the total fair value of the undelivered element is deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with SOP 97-2. The
difference between the total software arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements.  Revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists such as receipt of a signed
agreement, purchase order or a royalty report, delivery of the product including hardware has occurred generally F.O.B. shipping point, no significant obligations with regard to implementation remain, the fee is fixed and determinable, and
collectibility is probable. In addition, royalty revenue from certain distributors that do not meet our credit standards and revenues from our distributor agreement with Daikin are recognized upon sell-through to the end-customer. We consider all
arrangements with payment terms longer than one year not to be fixed and determinable. If the fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer.  Revenue from development agreements, whereby the development is essential to
the functionality of the licensed software, is recognized over the performance period based on proportional performance. Under this method, management is required to estimate the number of hours needed to complete a particular project, and revenues
and profits are recognized as the contract progresses to completion.  Deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenues have not been recognized which results from the following: 1 deferred maintenance and support; 2 amounts billed to certain distributors for our products not yet
sold through to the end-user customers; 3 amounts billed to technology customers for license and development agreements in advance of recognizing the related revenue; and 4 amounts billed to certain OEMs for products which contain one or more
undelivered elements.  dCash
Equivalents  Cash equivalents consist of short-term,
highly-liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and are stated at cost which approximates market value. Cash equivalents consist of money market funds.  eInventory  Inventory is valued at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or market.  fFixed Assets  Fixed assets consist of furniture and equipment and are recorded at cost
less accumulated depreciation. Equipment under capital leases is stated at the present value of minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease. Depreciation of furniture and equipment is provided using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets which are generally three to five years. Equipment held under capital leases is amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. 
44 Table of Contents
gPurchased and Internally Developed Software Costs  Purchased software and software product development costs are capitalized
when a products technological feasibility has been established and then are amortized over a future period. Amortization begins when a product is available for general release to customers. Amortization of capitalized software costs, for both
internally developed and purchased software products, is computed on a straight- line basis over the estimated economic life of the product, which is generally three years, or on a basis using the ratio of current revenue to the total of current and
anticipated future revenue, whichever is greater. All other research and development expenditures are charged to research and development expense in the period incurred.  hIncome Taxes  We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting. Under the asset and liability method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.  iBasic and diluted loss per share  The following table sets forth the computations of shares and net income loss per share, applicable to common shareholders used in the calculation of basic and diluted net income loss per share for the years ended
March 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 in thousands, except per share data, respectively:  Years Ended March 31 2001 2002 2003

2,691,574  jConcentrations of Risk  Financial instruments which potentially subject our Company to concentrations of credit risk are trade receivables. We manufacture and sell our products to customers who are primarily audio and video and graphic arts professionals who
prepare sound, video and graphics for use in the music recording, video, film and broadcast and printing industries or for corporate in-house use and to dealers who support such customers. Management believes that any risk of credit loss is
significantly reduced due to the diversity of its end users and their dispersion across many geographic sales areas. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide against potential credit losses.  Cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly-liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less and are stated at cost which approximates market value. Cash equivalents consist of money market funds. At of March 31, 2003 and 2002, approximately $7,500,000 and $10,000,000, respectively, was invested
in money market funds with one institution.  kLiquidity  In prior
fiscal years we had incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations. As of March 31, 2003, we have an accumulated deficit of $26,339,000 and positive working capital of $8,004,000. We have primarily funded operations through
private equity financing with Kingsbridge see Note 6 to the Financial Statements.  lStock-Based Compensation  Our Company has various stock-based compensation plans, as discussed in Note 7 to the Financial Statements. We have accounted for the effect of our stock based compensation plans under Accounting Principles Board
APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations. We have elected to adopt only the disclosure based requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and as such have disclosed the pro forma effects on net loss and net loss per share data as if we had elected to use the fair value approach to account for all our employee stock-based
compensation plans. 
46 Table of Contents
Had compensation cost for our plans been determined in accordance with the fair value approach enumerated
in SFAS No. 123, our net income loss and net income loss per share for the years ended March31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 would have been adjusted as indicated below in thousands, except per share data:  Years Ended March 31 2001 2002 2003
Net income loss as reported 5,855 4,182 2,537
Add: Stock based employee comp included in reported net income, net of related tax effects Deduct: Stock based employee compensation expense determined under the Fair Value based method for all awards, net of related tax
effects 1,557 1,903 2,454 Pro Forma net income loss 7,412 6,085 83 Reported basic net income loss per share 047 030 015 Reported diluted net income loss per share 047 030 013 Pro Forma basic net income loss per share 060 043 001 Pro Forma diluted net income loss per share 060 043 000
The fair value of
options granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2001, 2002 and 2003; risk-free interest rate of 517%, 405% and 25%, respectively;
expected life of 4 years; 110%, 125% and 112% expected volatility, respectively; and no dividends.  The effect of applying SFAS No. 123 for disclosing compensation costs may not be representative of the effects on reported net income loss for future
years because pro forma net income loss reflects compensation costs only for stock options granted in fiscal 1996 through 2003 and does not consider compensation costs for stock options granted prior to April 1, 1995.  The Company accounts for options and warrants issued to nonemployees in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or
Services. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value options granted to nonemployees. The related expense is recorded over the period in which the related services are received.  mImpairment of Long-Lived Assets 
We evaluate long-lived assets, including intangible assets other than
goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset. The amount of any impairment is measured
as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. We do not have any long-lived assets which we considered to be impaired during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003.  nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method for business combinations
initiated after June 30, 2001 and for which the date of acquisition is July 1, 2001 or later. Use of the pooling-of-interest method is no longer permitted. SFAS No. 141 also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business
combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. SFAS No. 142 addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements. With the adoption
of SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life; rather, goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying 
47 Table of Contents
a fair-value-based test. We continually review the events and circumstances related to our financial performance and economic environment for factors that
would provide evidence of impairment of goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment in accordance with SFAS 142 at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events, as defined in SFAS 142. Goodwill is tested for impairment
annually in a two-step process. First, we determine if the carrying amount exceeds fair value based on quoted market prices of our common stock, which would indicate that goodwill may be impaired. If we determine that goodwill may be
impaired, we will compare the implied fair value of the goodwill, as defined by SFAS 142, to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss, if any. Goodwill has resulted from our Ravisent product business acquisition during the
first quarter ended June 30, 2002, which was accounted for as a purchase, and from our DMD acquisition from VERITAS during the third quarter ended December 31, 2002, which was also accounted for as a purchase. As of March 31, 2003, no events have
occurred that would lead us to believe that there has been any impairment. If the benefit of an intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented or
exchanged, an acquired intangible asset should be separately recognized. We adopted SFAS No. 142 effective April 1, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 141 and 142 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS No. 143, in August 2001, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets SFAS No. 144, in October 2001. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation. SFAS No. 144 serves to
clarify and further define the provisions of SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. SFAS No. 144 does not apply to goodwill and other intangible assets that are not
amortized. SFAS No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002 and SFAS No. 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. We adopted SFAS No. 143 effective April 1, 2003 and have adopted SFAS No. 144
effective April 1, 2002. The effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. The adoption of SFAS 144 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of
operations.  In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. SFAS No. 145 rescinds Statement No. 4 Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of
Debt, and an amendment of that Statement, No. 64 Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements, and Statement No. 44 Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers. SFAS No. 145 also amends FASB Statement
No. 13 Accounting for Leases to eliminate the required accounting for sale-leaseback transactions. We adopted SFAS No. 145 effective April 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 145 did not have a material effect on our financial position or
results of operations.  In July 2002, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 addresses how costs associated with an exit activity or with a disposal of long-lived assets are to be accounted for.
SFAS No. 146 is effective for activities initiated after December 31, 2002, therefore, we adopted SFAS No. 146 effective January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued FASB Interpretation FIN No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN No. 45 provides expanded accounting guidance
surrounding liability recognition and disclosure requirements related to guarantees, as defined by this Interpretation. We adopted FIN No. 45 during the quarter ended December 31, 2002. In our ordinary course of business, we are not subject to
potential obligations under guarantees that fall within the scope of FIN No45 except for standard indemnification and warranty provisions that are contained within many of our customer license and service agreements, which give rise only to the
disclosure requirements prescribed by FIN No. 45. 
48 Table of Contents
Indemnification and warranty provisions contained in our customer license and service agreements are
generally consistent with those prevalent in our industry. The duration of our product warranties does not exceed 90 days following delivery of our products. We have not incurred significant obligations under customer indemnification or warranty
provisions historically and do not expect to incur significant obligations in the future. Accordingly we do not maintain accruals for any potential customer indemnification or warranty-related obligations.  In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. This statement also amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. We have adopted the annual disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 for the year ended March31, 2003. We will adopt the interim disclosure requirements
during the quarter ending June 30, 2003.  In January 2003, the
FASB issued FIN No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN No. 46 expands upon and strengthens existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets, liabilities
and activities of another entity. A variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors
that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN No. 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the
variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. The consolidation requirements of FIN No. 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31,
2003. The consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Certain disclosure requirements apply to any financial statements issued after January 31, 2003. The adoption of
this statement did not have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.  In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of
both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial
instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim
period beginning after June 15, 2003. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 150 to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.  oComprehensive Income Loss  We have no significant components of other comprehensive income loss and accordingly, comprehensive income loss equals
net loss.  pReclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the current period presentation.

FACILITIES AND DEBT RESTRUCTURING  On May 4, 2000, we
entered into a new Private Equity Line Agreement the Agreement with Kingsbridge Capital. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year March 31, 2001, we drew $200,000 from the equity line for which we issued 211,416 shares of Common Stock.
During the fiscal year March 31, 2002, we drew $2,400,000 from the equity line for which we issued 1,496,546 shares of Common Stock. During the fiscal year March 31, 2003, we drew $2,000,000 from the equity line for which we issued 269,360 shares of
Common Stock. These amounts were recorded net of fees of $126,000 and $16,000 in fiscal years 2002 and 2003, respectively. The Agreement terminated by its terms on November 13, 2002.  Since December 1996, we have entered into two different financing arrangements with Hambrecht Quist Guaranty Finance,
including a $5,100,000 financing facility and a $7,000,000 equity-based line of credit. In March 1998, $3,000,000 of the $5,100,000 financing facility was restructured into $1,500,000 of convertible Preferred Stock 461,538 shares and $1,500,000 of
debt. The debt had an interest rate of 725% and was due in October 1999. As of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001, all shares of the convertible Preferred Stock had been converted to Common Stock.  In October 1999, the $1,500,000 of debt due to Hambrecht and Quist Guaranty
Finance was restructured into 153,846 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and $1,000,000 of debt. The unpaid balance at March 31, 2001 was $57,000. During the year ended March 31, 2001, all of the shares of Series C convertible Preferred
Stock were converted to Common Stock. In connection with the debt restructuring, we issued warrants to purchase 120,000 common shares at an exercise price of $250, expiring on April 30, 2006. The fair value of the warrants was estimated using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions: volatility of 50, risk free interest rate of 6% and expected life equal to the contractual terms. These warrants expire on April 30, 2006 and are immediately exercisable. These
warrants were exercised with respect to 70,000 shares at various times during fiscal years 2001 and 2002. During the first quarter ended June 30, 2002, warrants with respect to the remaining 50,000 shares were exercised.  7SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY  Convertible Preferred Stock Series D  In February, 2001, we issued 700,000 shares of Series D Convertible
Preferred Stock the Preferred Stock to Daikin Industries in conjunction with our purchase of Daikin DVD valued at $1,750,000 or $250 per share. During the quarter ended September 30, 2002, Daikin converted 350,000 shares of their Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock into 350,000 shares of Common Stock and during the quarter ended December 31, 
52 Table of Contents
2002, Daikin converted all of their remaining shares of their Series D Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock.  Convertible Preferred Stock Series E  In December, 2001, we sold 250,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock to
Sanshin Electronic Co., Ltd. for $1,000,000. During the quarter ended September 30, 2002, Sanshin converted all of their Series E Preferred Stock into 250,000 shares of Common Stock.  Convertible Preferred Stock Series F  On December 18, 2002 we sold 1,290,948 shares of Series F Preferred Stock to VERITAS Operating Corporation and its
affiliates VERITAS in exchange for the Desktop and Mobile Division of VERITAS. The shares were sold pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 42 of the Securities Act of 1933. Each share of Series F Preferred Stock is convertible
at the option of the holder into one share of common stock subject to adjustment for certain dilutive events, such as stock splits. In March 2003, VERITAS converted all of their Series F Preferred Stock into 1,290,948 shares of Common Stock.
Stock Options  Under our September 1989 Stock Option Plan the 1989 Plan,
options to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,090,000 shares of Common Stock may be granted to key employees, directors and consultants. Grants of options to the directors of Sonic Solutions may not exceed 140,000 shares. The 1989 Plan provides for
issuing both incentive stock options, which must be granted at fair market value at the date of grant, and nonqualified stock options, which must be granted at not less than 85% of fair market value of the stock. All options to date have been
granted as incentive stock options. Options under the Plan generally vest over four years from the date of grant. The options generally expire ten years from the date of grant and are canceled three months after termination of employment. Our Board
of Directors and Chief Executive Officer administer the 1989 Plan.  During 1995, we adopted the 1994 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan the Non-Employee Plan which provides for the grant of stock options to Sonic Solutions non-employee directors. Under this plan, stock options are
granted annually at the fair market value of Sonic Solutions Common Stock on the date of grant. The number of options so granted annually is fixed by the plan. Such options generally vest over four years from the grant date. The total number
of shares to be issued under this plan may not exceed 100,000 shares. There were 12,000 options outstanding at March 31, 2003, at prices of $26560, $25625 and $16880 per share, all of which were exercisable. The Non-Employee Plan provides for
issuing both incentive stock options, which must be granted at fair market value at the date of grant, and nonqualified stock options, which must be granted at not less than 85% of fair market value of the stock. All options to date have been
granted as incentive stock options. Options under the Non-Employee Plan generally vest over four years from the date of grant. The options generally expire ten years from the date of grant and are canceled three months after termination of
employment. Our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer administer the Non-Employee Plan.  In July, 1998, the Board of Directors adopted the Sonic Solutions 1998 Stock Option Plan the 1998 Plan and the shareholders approved
the 1998 Stock Option Plan in September, 1998. The 1998 Plan covers 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock, with an annual increase in the number of shares available for issuance under the 1998 Plan on the last day of each fiscal year; provided that the
total number of shares issuable under the plan shall not exceed 2,000,000. The 1998 Plan provides for issuing both incentive stock options, which must be granted at fair market value at the date of grant, and nonqualified stock options, which must
be granted at not less than 85% of fair market value of the stock. All options to date have been granted as incentive stock options. Options under the 1998 Plan generally vest over four years from the date of grant. The options generally expire ten
years from the date of grant and are canceled three months after termination of employment. Our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer administer the 1998 Plan.

valuation allowance for the year ended March 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 was an increase of approximately $2,268,000, $2,696,000 and $138,000, respectively. Management believes that sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the future realization of
certain deferred tax assets and thus a full valuation allowance is required.  As of March 31, 2003, we have cumulative federal and California net operating losses of approximately $24,938,000 and $10,923,000, respectively, which can be used to offset future income subject to taxes. The federal
tax loss carryforwards will expire beginning in the year 2012 through 2023. The California tax loss carryforwards will expire beginning in the year 2002 through 2013.  California has imposed a moratorium on the utilization of loss carryforwards for the years 2002 and 2003.  As of March 31, 2003, we have cumulative unused research and development tax
credits of approximately $3,011,000 and $1,707,000 which can be used to reduce future federal and California income taxes, respectively. We also have cumulative foreign tax credit of approximately $113,000. Federal credit carryforwards expire from
2009 through 2023; California credits will carryforward indefinitely.  As of March 31, 2003, we have federal minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately $88,000 which are available to reduce federal regular income taxes, if any, over an indefinite period.  Utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be
subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards
and tax credit carryforwards before utilization.

Amounts for the current year are based on estimates and assumptions as of the date of this report and
could vary from amounts shown on the tax returns as filed. Accordingly, the variances from the amounts previously reported for the fiscal year 2002 are primarily a result of adjustments to conform to tax returns as filed.  9COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  aLeases  We lease certain facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating

To date, no contributions have been made to this plan by us.  cInventory Purchase Commitments 
Under the terms of an agreement with an outside supplier, we have a
commitment which requires us to purchase finished goods inventory from them subject to certain terms. At March 31, 2003, the amount was not significant.  dOther  We from time to time are subject to routine claims and litigation incidental to our business. We believe that the results of these matters will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  10SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER INFORMATION AND SEGMENT REPORTING  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, requires
companies to report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments, including segment profit or loss, certain specific revenue and expense items and segment assets, as well as information about the revenues derived
from our products and services, the countries in which we earn revenue and hold assets, and major customers. The method for determining what information to report is based on the way that management organized the operating segments within our
company for making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. 
57 Table of Contents
Our chief operating decision maker is considered to be our Chief Executive Officer CEO. The
CEO reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis accompanied by desegregated information about revenue by product line and revenue by geographic region for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial
performance. The consolidated financial information reviewed by the CEO is identical to the information presented in the accompanying statements of operations. Therefore, we operate in, and measure our results in a single operating segment. As such,
we are required to disclose the following revenue by product line, revenue by geographic and significant customer information:  Revenues by Product Line:  Years Ended March 31 2001
