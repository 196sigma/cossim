and SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Southern Peru Copper Corporation and
Subsidiaries the Company include the accounts of significant subsidiaries in
which the Company has voting control, and are prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States U.S. GAAP.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Revenue recognition Substantially all of the Company copper is sold under annual contracts.
Revenue is recognized primarily in the month product is shipped to customers
based on prices as provided in sales contracts. When the price is not
determinable at the time of shipment to customers, revenue is recognized based
on prices prevailing at the time of shipment with final pricing generally
occurring within three months of shipment. Revenues with respect to these sales
are adjusted in the period of settlement to reflect final pricing and in periods
prior to settlement to reflect any decline in market prices, which may occur
between shipment and settlement. The Company sells copper in blister and refined
form at industry standard commercial terms. Net sales include the invoiced value
of copper, silver, molybdenum, acid, and gains from the sale or settlement of
copper put options.
Cash equivalents and marketable securities Cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less, when purchased. Marketable securities include short-term liquid
investments with a maturity of more than three months, when purchased, and are
carried at cost, which approximates market.
Inventories Metal inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market. Costs
incurred in the production of metal inventories exclude general and
administrative costs. Supplies inventories are carried at average cost less a
reserve for obsolescence.
Property Assets are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. In accordance
with SFAS No. 121,Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, the Company reviews long-lived assets and
certain identifiable intangibles related to those assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
assets may not be recoverable. Any impairment loss on such assets, as well as
long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of, is
measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the
fair value of the assets less disposal costs, if applicable.
The Company evaluates the carrying value of assets based on undiscounted future
cash flows considering expected metal prices based on historical metal prices
and price trends.                                       A28 Betterments, renewals, costs of bringing new mineral properties into production,
and the cost of major development programs at existing mines are capitalized as
mineral land. Maintenance, repairs, normal development costs at existing mines,
and gains or losses on assets retired or sold are reflected in earnings as
incurred. Buildings and equipment are depreciated on the straight-line method
over estimated lives from 5 to 40 years or the estimated life of the mine if
shorter. Depletion of mineral land is computed by the units-of-production method
using proven and probable ore reserves.
Exploration Tangible and intangible costs incurred in the search for mineral properties are
charged against earnings when incurred.
Hedging Activities Derivative instruments may be used to manage exposure to market risk from
changes in commodity prices, interest rates or the value of the Company assets
and liabilities. Derivative instruments, which are designated as hedges, must be
deemed effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged
and must be designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract.
The Company may purchase put options or create synthetic put options to reduce
or eliminate the risk of metal price declines below the option strike price on a
portion of its anticipated future production. The cost of options is amortized
on a straight-line basis during the period in which the options are exercisable.
Gains or losses from the sale or exercise of options, net of unamortized
acquisition costs, are recognized in the period in which the underlying hedged
production is sold.
Swap Agreements Fuel swap agreements limit the effect of changes in the price of fuel. The
differential to be paid or received as fuel prices change is recorded as a
component of cost of sales in the period the swap covers.
Stock-Based Compensation The Company applies the disclosure only provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Impact of New Accounting Standards In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities.
Initially, the statement was to be effective in fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 1999. In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137, which defers the
effective date of SFAS No133 one year until June 15, 2000.
In June 2000 the FASB issued SFAS No138 Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, which amends the accounting and
reporting standards of SFAS No. 133 for certain derivative instruments and
certain hedging activities.
The Company will adopt SFAS No133 and No138 effective January 1, 2001 and its
implementation will not materially affect its results of operation or financial
condition.

Approximately $38 million of the provision is included as a cost of sales
deduction on the Company statement of earnings, and a $18 million is included
in administrative expense as it relates to non-operating personnel. This accrual
was paid in full in 1999.
4. Administrative Reorganization
The Company 1999 results include a $84 million pre-tax charge $54 million
after-tax and workers' participations associated with the severance cost of
foreign contract employees early termination. The severance costs accrued are
for 55 terminated employees at the Company location in Peru. Approximately
$58 million for the provision is included as cost of sales deduction on the
Company statement of earnings and $26 million is included in administrative
expense as it relates to non-operating personnel. Payments in the amount of $46
and $29 million were made against this accrual in the years 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

Total net deferred tax liabilities                             $908       $758
The net deferred tax liabilities above reflect deferred tax assets of $557
million and $797 million, before valuation allowance, and deferred tax
liabilities of $1286 and $1136 million at December 31, 2000 and December 31,
1999, respectively.
The decrease in the valuation allowance of $240 million from 1999 to 2000 is
primarily attributable to both the utilization and expiration of foreign tax
credits in 2000.
At December 31, 2000, the foreign tax credit carryforward available to reduce
possible future U.S. income tax amounted to approximately $43 million expiring
as follows: $31 million in 2003 and $12 million in 2004. Foreign tax credit
carryforwards amounting to approximately $115 million expired in 2000. Foreign
tax credit carryforwards amounting to approximately $146 million were utilized
in 2000. Both of these amounts had previously been entirely offset by a
valuation allowance.
The Company has not recorded the benefit of foreign tax credit carryforwards
because of both the expiration dates and the rules governing the order in which
such credits are utilized. The Company also has not recorded a benefit for the
AMT credits, which are not available to reduce AMT. Because of limitations on
both percentage depletion and foreign tax credits under the AMT, the Company
expects an AMT liability for the foreseeable future. Thus, while such credits do
not expire, it is unlikely they will be utilized. Accordingly, a valuation
allowance has been established for the full amount of the foreign tax credit
carryforward and the AMT credit carryforward.                                       A31 On December 30, 2000, the transitory Peruvian government issued a decree that
included, among other things, a reduction in the statutory income tax rate for
reinvested earnings in 2001 and for all earnings after 2001, from 30% to 20%.
The Company may benefit from the reduction to the 2001 rate when the government
issues the necessary regulations to make this effective. To be effective for
years after 2001, the reduction to the Peruvian tax rate must be confirmed by
the government in late 2001. Accordingly, the Company has not reflected the
effect of such rate reductions on its recorded deferred tax liability.
The Company obtains income tax credits in Peru for value-added taxes paid in
connection with the purchase of capital equipment and other goods and services
employed in its operations and records these credits as a prepaid expense. Under
current Peruvian law, the Company is entitled to use the credits against its
Peruvian income tax liability or to receive a refund. The carrying value of
these Peruvian tax credits approximates their market value.
6. Net Sales Net sales by country were as follows:

At December 31, 2000, the Company had no copper sales recorded at provisional
prices.
Under the terms of a sales contract with Union Miniere as amended through
December 31, 1999, the Company is required to supply Union Miniere, through its
agent, S.A. Sogem N.V., with 16,300 tons of blister copper annually for a ten
year period from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2009. The price of the
copper, contained in blister, supplied under the contract is determined based on
the LME monthly average settlement price, less a refining allowance, which is
negotiated annually.
Under the terms of a sales contract with Mitsui & Co. Ltd. Mitsui, the Company
is required to supply Mitsui with 48,000 tons of copper cathodes annually for a
fifteen-year period through December 31, 2013. If the shipment destination is
Asia, the pricing of the cathodes is based upon the LME monthly average
settlement price, however, if destination of shipments is the United States, the
pricing of the cathodes is based upon the COMEX monthly average settlement plus
a producer premium, which is agreed upon annually based on world market terms.
Ninety thousand tons related to a prior contract period 1994-2000 will be
supplied as follows: 48,000 in 2014 and 42,000 in 2015.                                       A32 7. Financial Instruments
Hedging Activities: The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its
exposure to market risk from changes in commodity prices. Derivative instruments
which are designated as hedges must be deemed effective at reducing the risk
associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at
the inception of the contract.
Copper: Depending on the market fundamentals and other conditions, the Company
may purchase put options to reduce or eliminate the risk of price declines below
the option strike price on a portion of its anticipated future production. Put
options purchased by the Company establish a minimum sales price for the
production covered by such put options and permit the Company to participate in
price increases above the option price. The cost of options is amortized on a
straight-line basis during the period in which the options are exercisable.
Depending upon market conditions, the Company may either sell options it holds
or exercise the options at maturity. Gains or losses from the sale or exercise
of options, net of unamortized acquisition costs, are recognized in the period
in which the underlying production is sold and are reported as a component of
the underlying transaction.
Earnings include pre-tax gains from option sales and exercises of $72 million
in 1998. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company held no copper put options.
Fuel Swaps: The Company may enter into fuel swap agreements to limit the effect
of increases in fuel prices on its production costs. A fuel swap establishes a
fixed price for the quantity of fuel covered by the agreement. The difference
between the published price for fuel and the price established in the contract
for the month covered by the swap is recognized in production costs. As of
December 31, 2000, the company had no fuel swap agreements
In 2000 and 1999, the Company production cost would have been $188 million
and $107 million higher, respectively, if this exposure had not been hedged. In
1998 it would have been $33 million lower.
Foreign currency: The Company selectively uses foreign currency swaps to limit
the effects of exchange rate changes on future cash flow obligations denominated
in foreign currencies. A currency swap establishes a fixed dollar cost for a
fixed amount of foreign currency required at a future date. The Company has
entered into currency swap agreements on a portion of its capital cost
contracted in Euros.
As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company had the following currency swap
agreements 2000         US$      Euros          Forward

A33 The unrealized loss in the Company currency swap position at December 31, 2000
was $11 million. A hypothetical 10% decrease from December 31, 2000 rates,
would increase the unrealized loss of currency swaps by $05 million. The
difference between the exchange rate of the Euro published at the end of month
and the exchange rate established in the contract, is recognized as an exchange
gain or loss in the profit and loss statement.
In 2000 a $48 million loss on currency swaps was recorded in the Company
earnings results.
For certain of the Company financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivables and accounts payable
the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
Consequently, such financial instruments are not included in the following table
that provides information about the carrying amounts and estimated fair values

Long-term debt: Fair value is based on the quoted market prices for the same or
similar issues.
8. Workers' Participation
Provisions for workers' participation are calculated at 8% of pre-tax earnings
and are included in Cost of sales on the earnings statement. The current
portion of this participation, which is accrued during the year is based on
Branch taxable income and is distributed to workers following determination of
final results for the year.
9. Minority Interest of Investment Shares Previously known as Labor Shares
The minority interest of the Investment Shares is based on the earnings of the
Company Peruvian Branch.
The Company acquired 04 million, 08 million and 10 million investment shares
at a cost of $15 million, $34 million and $38 million in the years 2000, 1999
and 1998, respectively. The carrying value of the minority interest purchased
was reduced by $10 million, $21 million and $25 million in 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively, and the excess paid over the carrying value was assigned
primarily to proven and probable sulfide and leachable ore reserves and
mineralized material and is being amortized based on production. As a result of
these acquisitions, the remaining investment shareholders hold a 15% interest
in the Branch at December 31, 2000, and are entitled to a pro rata participation
in the cash distributions made by the Branch. The investment shares are recorded
as a minority interest in the Company financial statements.                                       A34 10. Inventories

In July 2000, the Company received authorization from the Comision Nacional
Supervisora de Empresas y Valores CONASEV to issue the equivalent of up to
$200 million in bonds in the Peruvian market The Program. Under this
program, on July 20, 2000, the Company issued $30 million at a nominal fixed
rate of 875%. On December 7, 2000 the Company issued an additional $20 million
at the same rate; in both cases, maturity is seven years.
In March 1999, the Company concluded a $100 million 15-year loan agreement with
Mitsui and Co., Ltd. The applicable interest for this loan is the LIBO rate plus
125%. This facility provides additional committed financing for SPCC
modernization and expansion program. A commitment fee of 05% per annum is
payable on the undrawn portion of this loan. As of December 31, 2000, the loan
was fully drawn.
In 1997, the Company privately placed $150 million SENS in the United States and
international markets. These notes, which have been registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, have an average maturity of seven years and
a final maturity in 2007 and were priced at par with a coupon rate of 79%. In
addition, in 1997, the Company sold $50 million of bonds, due June 2004 to
investors in Peru. The bonds have an effective fixed interest rate of 825%.
In 1997, the Company entered into a $600 million seven-year credit agreement
with a group of international financial institutions. The agreement consists of
a $400 million term loan facility and a $200 million revolving credit facility.
The interest rate for years four and five of the agreement on any loans
outstanding is LIBOR plus 200% per annum for term loans and LIBOR plus 225%
for revolving credit loans. A commitment fee of 05% per annum is payable on the
undrawn portion of the facility. No amounts have been drawn under this agreement
as of December 31, 2000.
Some financing agreements contain covenants, which limit the payment of
dividends to stockholders. Under the most restrictive covenant, the Company may
pay dividends to stockholders equal to 50% of its net income for any fiscal
quarter as long as such dividends are paid by June 30 of the following year. As
a result, net assets of the Company unavailable for the payment of dividends
totaled $12 billion at December 31, 2000. In accordance with the most
restrictive covenant of the Company loan agreements, additional indebtedness
of $8444 million would have been permitted at December 31, 2000.
The Mitsui and Co., Ltd. credit agreement is collateralized by pledges of
receivables of 24,000 tons of copper per year. The EXIM Bank credit agreement is
collateralized by pledges of receivables from sales of 7,000 tons of copper per
year. Starting June 1, 2001 once the EXIM Bank loan is fully paid, these 7,000
tons will be pledged to Mitsui and Co., Ltd. under the credit agreement. The CAF
loan is collateralized by liens on the SX/EW facility. The SENS and the
seven-year loan facility require that most of the collections of export copper
sales be deposited into a trust account in the United States. Twenty percent of
these collections are used as collateral for the outstanding SENS with the
balance of the                                       A36 collections remitted directly to the Company. The excess funds in the collateral
account are remitted to the Company, if all financial requirements are met. As
part of these agreements, the Company must maintain three-month and six month
collection ratios, as defined aggregate collections as a specified multiple of
debt service. Both facilities require escrow deposits of three months debt
service. In addition, certain of the agreements require the Company to maintain
a minimum stockholders' equity of $750 million, specified ratios of debt to
equity, current assets to current liabilities and an interest coverage test.
Reduction of ASARCO Incorporated ASARCO voting interest in the Company to
less than a majority would constitute an event of default under two of the
financing agreements. The Company was in compliance with the various loan
covenants at December 31, 2000. Included in other assets at December 31, 2000
and 1999 are $179 million and $107 million, respectively, held in escrow
accounts as required by the Company loan agreements. The funds will be
released from escrow as scheduled loan repayments are made.
14. Benefit Plans
The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering salaried
employees in the United States and certain employees in Peru. Benefits are based
on salary and years of service. The Company funding policy is to contribute
amounts to the plans sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements set
forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, plus such
additional amounts as the Company may determine to be appropriate. Plan assets
are invested in commingled stock and bond funds.
Effective October 31, 2000 the Board of Directors amended the pension plan to
suspend the accrual of benefits.
The components of net periodic benefit costs are as follows For the years ended December 31,                    2000        1999        1998

Company plan is available for all retired salaried employees who permanently
reside in the United States and who contribute amounts as defined by the plan.
The plan is unfunded.
Effective October 31,2000, the health care plan for retirees was terminated and
the Company informed retirees that they would be covered by the post-retirement
health care plan of ASARCO Incorporated, which offers substantially the same
benefits and requires the same contributions.

Weighted-Average Assumptions
Discount rate                 78%        78 The annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits
i.e., health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 5%. The health care cost
trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For
example, increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage
point would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation costs for
2000 by $01 million and the service and interest cost components of net
periodic postretirement benefit would have an insignificant change. Decreasing
the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year
would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for 2000 by
$01 million and the service and interest cost components of net periodic
postretirement benefit costs would have an insignificant change.                                       A39 Employee Savings Plan The Company maintains an employee savings plan for employees working in the
United States and expatriate employees in Peru, which permits employees to make
contributions by payroll deduction pursuant to section 401k of the Internal
Revenue Code. The plan provides for a Company matching contribution equal to 50%
of the first 6% of employee contributions. In connection with the required
match, the Company contributions charged against earnings were $002 million 01 million and $02 million in the years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Effective November 15, 2000 the savings plan was terminated and no further
contributions from employees or the Company are accepted after that date. The
plan is awaiting a final letter of determination from the Internal Revenue
Service to proceed with the distribution of assets to plan participants.

Stock Options The Company has two stockholder approved plans, a Stock Incentive Plan and a
Directors' Stock Award Plan. The Stock Incentive Plan provides for the granting
of nonqualified or incentive stock options, as defined under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as well as for the award of restricted stock
and bonuses payable in stock. The price at which options may be granted under
the Stock Incentive Plan shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of
the common stock on the date of grant in the case of incentive stock options, or
50% in the case of other options. In general, options are not exercisable for
six months and expire after 10 years from the date of grant.
Options granted may provide for Stock Appreciation Rights SAR. A SAR permits
an optionee, in lieu of exercising the option, to receive from the Company
payment of an amount equal to the difference between the market value of the
stock on the date of election of the SAR and the purchase price of the stock
under the terms of the option.
The authorized number of shares under the Stock Incentive Plan is 1,000,000 of
which 300,000 may be awarded as restricted stock. At December 31, 2000, 645,060
shares are available for future grants under this plan 645,060 shares at
December 31, 1999. The weighted average remaining contractual life of stock
option outstanding as of December 31, 2000 was 61 years.                                       A40 The Directors' Stock Award Plan provides that directors who are not compensated
as employees of the Company will be automatically awarded 200 shares of common
stock upon election and 200 additional shares following each annual meeting of
stockholders thereafter. Under the directors' plan, 100,000 shares have been
reserved for awards. At December 31, 2000, 16,800 have been awarded under this
plan.
The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Accordingly, no compensation cost has
been recognized for awards under the stock incentive plan. If compensation cost
for the Company Stock Incentive Plan had been determined based on the fair
value at the grant date for awards in 2000, 1999 and 1998, consistent with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company net earnings and earnings per share
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below in millions, except per share amounts                                       2000      1999      1998

Grupo Mexico, whose subsidiary, Southern Peru Holdings Corporation is a 542%
stockholder of the Company, provides advice and services encompassing legal
advice                                       A41 on corporate matters, including shareholder and board meetings, advice on
financing, refinancing and other financial matters, preparation of outside
finance reports, services in all matters related to Human Resources, services
for engineering and construction, services for purchasing, procurement and
logistics, advice for international sales and for development of new projects to
the Company. In 2000, the Company paid to Grupo Mexico $70 million for these
services. In 1999 and 1998 the Company paid to ASARCO, 542% stockholder at the
time, for tax, treasury and administrative support services provided to the
Company, $08 million and $10 million respectively.
Minera Mexico International, Inc., a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico and Asarco,
purchased copper products from SPCC during 2000 in the amount of $267 million.
Asarco had no purchases from SPCC in 1999 and $146 million in purchases of
copper products in 1998.
Phelps Dodge Refining Corporation, an affiliate of Phelps Dodge and Phelps Dodge
Corporation, affiliated companies of a shareholder of SPCC, purchased copper
products from the Company in the amount of $683 million in 2000. Phelps Dodge
had no purchases from SPCC in 1999 and $41 million in purchases of copper
products in 1998.
Cerro Wire & Cable Co. and other affiliated companies of The Marmon Group, Inc.,
an affiliated company of one of the shareholders of SPCC purchased copper
products from the Company during 2000 in the amount of $132 million. There were
no copper purchases in 1999 and in 1998.
The Company purchases ocean shipping services from companies indirectly
controlled by QUEMCHI S.A. Its Vice Chairman is also a director of SPCC. The
total cost of these services amounted to $78 million, $83 million and $115
million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
17. Concentration of Risk
The Company operates two copper mines, a smelter and two refineries in Peru and
substantially all of its assets are located there. There can be no assurances
that the Company operations and assets that are subject to the jurisdiction of
the Government of Peru may not be adversely affected by future actions of such
government. Substantially all of the Company products are exported from Peru
to customers principally in Europe, Asia, South America and the United States.
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to a concentration
of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities and trade accounts receivable.
The Company invests or maintains available cash with various high-quality banks,
principally in the U.S., Canada and Peru, or in commercial paper of highly rated
companies. As part of its cash management process, the Company regularly
monitors the relative credit standing of these institutions, and by policy,
limits the amount of credit exposure to any one institution. At December 31,
2000, the Company had invested 3363% of its cash equivalents and marketable
securities with Peruvian banks, out of which 4232% was invested with one
institution.
During the normal course of business, the Company provides credit to its
customers. Although the receivables resulting from these transactions are not
collateralized, the Company has not experienced significant problems with the
collection of receivables.
The largest ten trade receivable balances accounted for 706% of the trade
accounts receivable at December 31, 2000, of which one customer represented
189%.
18. Commitments and Contingencies
In September 1996, the Company announced a two-stage project which includes an
expansion of the Cuajone mine and an expansion and modernization of the copper
smelter at Ilo. At present, total capital cost for this project is estimated at
$870 million, budgeted to be spent through the year 2006.
The Cuajone mine expansion was completed in 1999. Additional equipment was
received during year 2000.
The second stage of the program, the expansion and modernization of the Ilo
smelter, is expected to be completed by the year 2006 at an estimated cost of
$672 million.
As a result of the expansion program, electric power requirements will increase
significantly, requiring the construction of substantial additional generating
capacity. In 1997, the Company sold its existing power plant to an independent
power company for $336 million. In connection with the sale, a power purchase                                       A42 agreement was also completed, under which the Company agreed to purchase its
power needs for the next twenty years.
Environmental Company activities are subject to Peruvian laws and regulations. SPCC submitted
in 1996 the Environmental Compliance and Management Plan known by its Spanish
acronym, PAMA to the Peruvian Government as part of such regulations. The PAMA
included all current operations that did not have an approved environmental
impact study at the time. SPCC PAMA was approved in January 1997 and it
contains 32 mitigation measures and projects necessary to bring the existing
operations to the established environmental standards. By the end of year 2000,
sixteen of such projects were already completed.
The Smelter Expansion and Modernization Project represents the largest and most
significant project in which the Company will embark itself in the next few
years. Both options under consideration comply with the Company requirements.
That is, to employ proven technology that will provide both a good economic
return and exceed the requirements of current environmental regulations. The
alternatives may provide an opportunity to increase the smelter capacity
beyond the 11 million metric tons originally proposed and improve SO2 capture
to more than the PAMA 92% requirement.
Starting in November of 1995, Southern Peru established and continues to operate
the Supplementary Control Program SCP, a voluntary effort, by which the
smelter production is curtailed during periods of adverse meteorological
conditions. For the year 2000, in conjunction with the operation of the
smelter sulfuric acid plant that produced over 326,000 metric tons, this
program has contributed to improve air quality in Ilo. In addition to the
environmental programs dealing with air quality issues, the Company continues to
have good results with the remediation programs in both Ite bay and the slag
removal program on the beaches to the north of the smelter.
At the end of the year, SPCC submitted to the government the Spill Response
Plans for the three operating areas. Both ocean and land response equipment has
been purchased, and personnel training will continue during 2001.
Environmental capital expenditures for the period 1996-2000 exceeded $120
million. The Company foresees significant environmental capital expenditures
starting in 2001, once the Smelter Expansion and Modernization Project begins.
Litigation In April 1996, the Company was served with a complaint filed in Peru by
approximately 800 former employees seeking the delivery of substantial number of
investment shares formerly called labor shares of its Peruvian Branch plus
dividends. In October 1997, the Superior Court of Lima nullified a decision of a
court of first instance, which had been adverse to the Company. The Superior
Court remanded the case for a new trial. Plaintiffs filed an extraordinary
appeal before the Peruvian Supreme Court. The Supreme Court may grant
discretionary review in limited cases. In March 1999, the Company received
official notification that the Superior Court had denied plaintiffs'
extraordinary appeal and affirmed the decision of the Supreme Court of Lima,
which remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings. In December
1999, the lower court decided against the Company, ordering the delivery of the
investment shares and dividends to the plaintiffs. The Company appealed this
decision in January 2000. On October, 10, 2000, the Superior Court of Lima
affirmed the lower court decision which had been adverse to the Company. The
Company has filed an extraordinary appeal before the Peruvian Supreme Court. The
Supreme Court may grant discretionary review in limited cases.
There is also pending against the Company a similar lawsuit filed by 127
additional former employees. In the third quarter of 1997, the court of first
instance dismissed their complaint. Upon appeal filed by the plaintiffs, the                                       A43 Superior Court of Lima, in the third quarter of 1998, nullified the lower
court decision on technical ground and remanded the case to the lower court
for further proceedings. In December 1999, the lower court dismissed the
complaint against the Company. Plaintiffs appealed this decision in January 2000
before the Superior Court. By the end of year 2000 the Superior Court rejected
the appeal. Plaintiffs have filed an extraordinary appeal before the Supreme
Court. The Supreme Court may grant discretionary review in limited cases.
On December 28, 2000, a lawsuit was filed against the Company in federal court
in New York City. The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive
damages for alleged personal injuries to eight persons resident in Peru arising
from alleged releases into the environment from the Company operations in
Peru. The lawsuit is similar to a suit filed in 1995 in Texas, which was
dismissed in 1996 by a U. S. district judge. That ruling was affirmed
unanimously by a three-judge federal appeals court. The court made it clear that
the claims of Peruvian residents should be tried in the courts of Peru, not in
the United States.
It is the opinion of management that the outcome of the legal proceedings
mentioned, as well as other miscellaneous litigation and proceedings now
pending, will not materially adversely affect the financial position of the
Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. However, it is possible that
litigation matters could have a material effect on quarterly or annual operating
results, when they are resolved in future periods.                                       A44             Report of Independent Accountants

financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for the opinion expressed above. We have not audited the consolidated financial
statements of the Company for any period subsequent to December 31, 1999. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

Assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that tax rates
are unchanged, that the number of shares outstanding is unchanged, and giving no
effect to hedging programs or changes in the costs of production, metal price
sensitivity factors would indicate the following estimated change in earnings
per share resulting from metal price changes in 2001. Estimates are based on
800 million shares outstanding.                        Copper       Silver       Molybdenum
