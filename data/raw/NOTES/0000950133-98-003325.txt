INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT The Board of Directors:
SPACEHAB, Incorporated and Subsidiary We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SPACEHAB,
Incorporated and subsidiary the Company as of June 30, 1997 and 1998, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity deficit, and
cash flows for the nine months ended June 30, 1996 and the years ended June 30,
1997 and 1998. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of SPACEHAB,
Incorporated and subsidiary as of June 30, 1997 and 1998, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for the nine months ended June 30, 1996
and the years ended June 30, 1997 and 1998, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.                            /s/ KPMG PEAT MARWICK LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                1 9 9 8 1 DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY
SPACEHAB, Incorporated the Company is the first company to
commercially develop, own and operate habitable modules that provide space-based
laboratory research facilities and cargo services aboard the U.S. Space Shuttle
system. The Company currently owns and operates three pressurized laboratory and
logistics supply modules which significantly enhance the capabilities of the
Space Shuttle fleet. The Company is currently constructing a new science module
with associated double module hardware. The Company modules are unique to the
Space Shuttle fleet.
To date, the Company has successfully completed eleven missions
aboard the Space Shuttle and substantially all of the Company revenue has been
generated under fixed price contracts with NASA. The Company contracts are
subject to termination for convenience and periodic funding allocations by
NASA. NASA funding is dependent on receiving annual appropriations from the
United States government.
On February 12, 1997, the Company acquired the assets and certain of
the liabilities of Astrotech Space Operations, L.P., a subsidiary of Northrop
Grumman, a provider of commercial satellite launch processing services and
payload processing facilities in the United States. These services are provided
at the Astrotech facilities in Cape Canaveral, Florida and Vandenberg Air Force
Base in California, and are provided to launch service providers on a
fixed-price basis. Additionally, Astrotech provides management and consulting
services to the Boeing Company for its Sea Launch program at the Boeing facility
in Long Beach, California. 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
SPACEHAB, Incorporated and its wholly owned subsidiary, Astrotech Space
Operations, Inc. Astrotech. All significant intercompany transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.
FISCAL YEAR
Effective October 1, 1995, the Company changed its fiscal year-end
from September 30 to June 30. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated
financial statements present the Company results of operations for the nine
months ended June 30, 1996 and the years ended June 30, 1997 and 1998.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
For purposes of its consolidated statements of cash flows, the
Company considers short-term investments with original maturities of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. All furniture, fixtures
and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the respective assets, which is generally five years. The
Company payload processing facilities are depreciated using the straight-line
method over their estimated useful lives ranging from sixteen to forty-three
years.
Through June 30, 1997, the Company flight modules were depreciated
over a ten-year period using the straight-line method. Effective July 1, 1997,
the Company extended the estimated useful lives of its space modules through
2012. This change in accounting estimate is treated prospectively and is based
on current available information from NASA, which has estimated the duration of
the Space Shuttle Program through at least 2012. As a result of this change in
estimate, the Company net income increased by $4,145,000 for fiscal year 1998.
During fiscal year 1997, SPACEHAB adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-lived Assets
and for Long-lived Assets to be Disposed Of Statement 121. Statement 121
requires that long-lived assets to be held and used, including goodwill, be
reviewed by the Company for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss
is recognized when the undiscounted net cash flows associated with the asset are
less than the asset carrying amount. Impairment losses, if any, are measured
as                    24
25
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair market
value. The adoption of Statement 121 did not have an impact on the Company
consolidated results of operations for the years ended June 30, 1997 or 1998.
GOODWILL
The excess of the cost over the fair value of Astrotech net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired has been assigned to
goodwill. Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over twenty
years.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
During fiscal year 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-based Compensation Statement 123, which encourages, but does not
require, the recognition of stock-based employee compensation at fair value. The
Company has elected to continue to account for stock-based employee compensation
using the intrinsic value method as prescribed in Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations. Accordingly, compensation cost for options to purchase common
stock granted to employees is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value
of common stock at the date of the grant over the exercise price an employee
must pay to acquire the common stock.
Warrants to purchase common stock granted to other than employees as
consideration for goods or services rendered are recognized at fair market
value.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue was recognized upon completion of each module flight for the
CMAM and Mir contracts note 10. Total contract price was allocated to each
flight based on the amount of services the Company provided on the flight
relative to the total services provided for all flights under contract.
Obligations associated with a specific mission, e.g., integration services, were
also recognized upon completion of the mission. Costs directly related to
specific CMAM and Mir missions were deferred until the respective missions were
completed. The CMAM contract was completed in October 1996 and the Mir contract
was completed in June 1998.
For all other contract awards for which the capability to
successfully complete the contract can be reasonably assured and costs at
completion can be reliably estimated at contract inception, revenue recognition
under the percentage-of-completion method is being used based on costs incurred
over the period of the contract. Revenue provided by Astrotech payload
processing services is recognized ratably over the occupancy period of the
satellite while in the Astrotech facilities. Contract losses are recognized when
they become known.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
INCOME TAXES
The Company recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability
method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.
NET INCOME PER SHARE
In December 1997, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share, Statement 128.
Statement 128 supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 15, Earnings
per Share APB 15 and its related interpretations, and promulgates new
accounting standards for the computation and manner of presentation of the
Company earnings per share. The Company has restated previously reported
annual earnings per share data in accordance with the provisions of Statement
128 note 14. The Company does not believe that the adoption of Statement 128
had a material impact on the computation or manner of presentation of its
earnings per share data as currently or previously presented under APB 15.
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.                    25
26
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
The computation of diluted earnings per share includes all common stock options
and warrants and other common stock, to the extent dilutive, that potentially
may be issued as a result of conversion privileges, including the convertible
subordinated notes payable note 8.
All computations of income per share include the effect of the 1 for
24 reverse split of common stock in December 1995 note 11.
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reported periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain fiscal year 1996 and 1997 amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the fiscal 1998 consolidated financial statement presentation. 3 STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS - SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

6 LOANS PAYABLE UNDER CREDIT AGREEMENT
Prior to an August 1996 amendment, the Company credit agreement
consisted of a $6,458,000 term loan bearing interest at 1 percent per month and
a $5,495,000 noninterest-bearing term loan with several insurance companies. In
addition, a revolving credit commitment with a subcontractor and former
shareholder, provided a maximum outstanding balance of $6,000,000 and bore
interest at a rate of 1 percent per month.
In August 1996, the Company credit agreement was amended. Under the
amendment, the revolving credit commitment with a subcontractor and former
shareholder was canceled. In exchange for the full satisfaction of the Company
term loans with the various insurance companies, the Company paid the insurance
companies $2,500,000 and agreed to pay an additional $2,000,000 under a new
noninterest-bearing term loan. The new term loan is due in installments of
$500,000 on each of August 1, 1997 and 1998, and $334,000 on each of August 1,
1999, 2000 and 2001. As a result of this amended and restated agreement, the
Company recognized an extraordinary gain of $3,274,000, net of income taxes and
other related expenses of $819,000 and $110,000, respectively, during the year
ended June 30, 1997.
Aggregate interest cost incurred on the debts due under the various
credit agreements was approximately $561,000 and $64,000 for the nine months
ended June 30, 1996 and the year ended June 30, 1997. There was no interest
incurred under these agreements during the year ended June 30, 1998. 7 NOTES PAYABLE TO SHAREHOLDER
The Company issued subordinated notes for a portion of the amount due
to Alenia Spazio S.p.A. Alenia, a shareholder, under a previously completed
construction contract for the Company flight modules. Such notes had aggregate
outstanding balances of $11,225,000 and $11,895,000 at June 30, 1997 and 1998,
respectively. The notes bear interest at an annual rate of 12 percent. No amount
of principal or accrued interest on the notes is due until all amounts under the
amended and restated credit agreement due to the various insurance companies
note 6 are repaid. As such, all principal payments are due under these notes
on August 1, 2001. However, during fiscal 1998, the Company began paying
interest quarterly. The Company paid $357,000 of interest during the year ended
June 30, 1998 and will continue to pay interest quarterly. Additionally, the
Company has accrued interest of $357,000 as of June 30, 1998 included in
accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Interest cost converted on the notes to Alenia was approximately
$846,000, $1,300,000, and $670,000 for the nine months ended June 30, 1996 and
the years ended June 30, 1997 and 1998, respectively. 8 LONG-TERM DEBT CONVERTIBLE NOTE PAYABLE
On August 12, 1992, the Company issued a subordinated promissory note
to an investment bank in the amount of $900,000, carrying interest at LIBOR plus
3 percent, and maturing six months after the payment of all other indebtedness
due under the amended and restated credit agreement and the subordinated notes
to Alenia. Through June 30, 1996, the Company had elected to defer the payment
of interest under the note, which accrued and was converted to additional
outstanding principal. The note was convertible at the option of the holder into
75,000 shares of the Company common stock at any time prior to maturity. On
October 25, 1996, the investment bank exercised its option to convert the note
into the Company common stock. In accordance with the terms of the agreement,
interest that accrued during fiscal year 1997 of approximately $25,000 through
the date of conversion was waived.
Interest cost incurred on this note was approximately $58,000 for the
nine months ended June 30, 1996.                    27

8 LONG-TERM DEBT CONTINUED
CREDIT FACILITIES
On June 16, 1997, the Company entered into a $10,000,000 line of

rate. This loan is collateralized by the Company intangible assets, accounts
receivable, and other property in which a lien is granted to the lender. The
term of the agreement is through October 1998. Through June 30, 1998, the

their fair market value because of the relatively short duration of these
instruments. 10 NASA CONTRACTS
COMMERCIAL MIDDECK AUGMENTATION MODULE CONTRACT
On November 30, 1990, NASA and the Company entered into the
Commercial Middeck Augmentation Module contract CMAM to lease to NASA a
portion of the middeck augmentation modules and related integration services at
an aggregate firm fixed price of $184,236,000 over six missions. During the year
ended September 30, 1994, the terms of the CMAM contract were amended to reduce
the number of missions from six to five, although the total locker space leased
by NASA and the contract value remained the same.
During the nine months ended June 30, 1996, and the years ended June
30, 1997 and 1998, the Company recognized approximately $45,634,000, $7,963,000,

stock purchase plan that permits eligible employees to purchase shares of common
stock of the Company at prices no less than 85 percent of the current market
price. Eligible employees may elect to participate in the plan by authorizing
payroll deductions from one percent to ten percent of gross compensation for
each payroll period. On the last day of each quarter, each participant
contribution account is used to purchase the maximum number of whole and
fractional shares of common stock determined by dividing the contribution
account balance by the lesser of 85 percent of the price of a share of common
stock on the first day of the quarter or the last day of a quarter. The maximum
number of shares of common stock that may be purchased under the plan is
1,500,000. Through June 30, 1998, 13,199 shares have been issued under the plan.

The Company applies APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for its plans. Accordingly, as all options have been granted at
exercise prices equal to the fair market value as of the date of grant, no
compensation cost has been recognized under these plans in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements. Had compensation cost been determined
consistent with Statement 123, the Company net income and earnings per common
share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below in
thousands, except per share data                Nine months       Years ended

The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions used for grants in fiscal years 1996, 1997 and 1998: 00
percent dividend growth; expected volatility ranging from 35 percent to 40
percent; risk-free interest rates ranging from 568 percent to 671 percent; and
expected lives ranging from three to seven years.
The effects of compensation cost as determined under Statement 123 on
net income in fiscal year 1996, 1997 and 1998 may not be representative of the
effects on pro forma net income in future periods.
WARRANTS
The Company also has 53,000 currently exercisable warrants
outstanding to purchase the Company common stock at $900 per share, with
various expiration dates through June 2002. The fair market value of these

As of June 30, 1998, current deferred tax assets of $151,000 are
included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying
balance sheet.
The net changes in the total valuation allowance for the nine months
ended June 30, 1996 and the years ended June 30, 1997 and 1998 were decreases of
$10,144,000, $4,655,000, and $2,058,000, respectively.
At June 30, 1998, the Company had accumulated net operating losses of
$7,850,000 available to offset future regular taxable income. These operating
loss carryforwards expire between the years 2006 and 2009. Utilization of these
net operating losses may be subject to limitations in the event of significant
changes in stock ownership of the Company.
Additionally, the Company has approximately $2,189,000 and $4,905,000
of research and experimentation and alternative minimum tax credit
carryforwards, respectively, available to offset future regular tax liabilities.
The research and experimentation credits expire between the years 2001 and 2007;
the alternative minimum tax credits carryforward indefinitely.
In assessing the realizably of deferred tax assets, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets are realizable. Management considers the scheduled reversal
of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning
strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of projected future
regular taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are
deductible, management believes that the Company will realize the benefits of
these deductions. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable,
however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future regular
taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced.                    32

Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, which
established new guidelines for the calculations of earnings per share. Earnings
per share for all prior periods have been restated to reflect the provisions of
this Statement.
