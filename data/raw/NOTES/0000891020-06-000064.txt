Item8 for the pro forma net income loss and net income
loss per share amounts, for the years ended December31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, as if we had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS123 to measure compensation
expense for employee stock incentive awards. Upon adoption
during the quarter ending March31, 2006, we will recognize
stock-based compensation using the modified prospective method
and expects that the implementation will have a material impact
on our consolidated financial statements in 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was
$4608million and $70million in 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was
$88million in 2003. Net cash provided by operating
activities in 2005 resulted primarily from net income of
$3123million, net changes in certain assets and
liabilities of $512million, due primarily to the timing
of cash receipts or payments at the beginning and end of the
year, a change in net deferred tax assets of
$1072million, depreciation and amortization of
$164million, and a gain on sale of certain of our equity
investments of $193million, which were partially offset
by a decrease in the accrued loss on excess office facilities of
$62million and the loss on content agreement of
$29million. Net cash provided by operating activities in
2004 resulted primarily from net changes in certain assets and
liabilities of $107million, due primarily to the timing
of cash receipts or payments at the beginning and end of the
year, depreciation and amortization of $153million,
equity in the net loss of MusicNet of $44million and the
loss on content agreement of $29million, which were
offset by a net loss of $230million and a decrease in the
accrued loss on excess office facilities of $48million.
Net cash used in operating activities in 2003 was the result of
a net loss of $215million as 48 Table of Contents well as net changes in certain assets and liabilities of
$81million, due primarily to the timing of cash receipts
or payments at the beginning and end of the year and the
recognition of deferred revenue, offset by depreciation and
amortization of $124million, equity in net loss of
MusicNet of $54million and a net increase in the accrued
loss on excess office facilities of $30million. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2005 and 2004 was
$70million and $60million, respectively. Net cash
used in investing activities was $224million in 2003. Net
cash provided by investing activities in 2005 was primarily due
to net sales and purchases of short-term investments and
proceeds from the sale of certain equity investments, which was
offset by purchases of equipment and intangible assets and cash
used for acquisitions. Net cash provided by investing activities
in 2004 was primarily due to net sales and purchases of
short-term investments, which was offset by purchases of
equipment and intangible assets and cash used for acquisitions.
Net cash used in investing activities in 2003 was primarily due
to the payment of acquisition costs and purchases of long-term
investments and equipment and leasehold improvements, offset by
net sales and purchases of short-term investments. Net cash used in financing activities was $346million in
2005. Net cash provided by financing activities was
$85million in 2004 and $1071million in 2003. Net
cash used in financing activities in 2005 was due primarily to
the repurchase of common stock, which was partially offset by
the net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock
sold related to our employee stock purchase plan. Net cash
provided by financing activities in 2004 was due to the net
proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock sold
related to our employee stock purchase plan. Net cash provided
by financing activities in 2003 was related to the proceeds from
our convertible debt offering in June 2003 see Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements Convertible
Debt Note9 for a description of this offering,
exercise of stock options and warrants and stock sold related to
our employee stock purchase plan. In September 2001, we announced a share repurchase program to
repurchase of up to an aggregate of $50million of our
outstanding common stock. We repurchased approximately
91million shares of our common stock at an average cost
of $464per share for an aggregate value of
$424million from the inception of the September 2001
program through August 2005. There were no repurchases during
2005 or 2004 related to the September 2001 repurchase program.
In August 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a new share
repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of
$75million of our outstanding common stock, which replaced
the September 2001 program. In November 2005, our Board of
Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the
repurchase of up to an aggregate of $100million of our
outstanding common stock, which replaced the August 2005
repurchase program and included $440million that remained
unpurchased under the August 2005 program. During 2005, under
the August 2005 program we repurchased approximately
58million shares at an average cost of $536 for an
aggregate value of approximately $310million and under
the November 2005 repurchase program, we repurchased
approximately 28million shares at an average cost of
$816per share for an aggregate value of approximately
$233million. We currently intend to continue our stock
repurchase program, of which there was approximately
$766million remaining as of December31, 2005,
depending on market conditions and other factors until we reach
the $100million limit authorized by our Board of
Directors, which will be a further use of cash. We currently have no planned significant capital expenditures
for 2006 other than those in the ordinary course of business. In
the future, we may seek to raise additional funds through public
or private equity financing, or through other sources such as
credit facilities. The sale of additional equity securities
could result in dilution to our shareholders. In addition, in
the future, we may enter into cash or stock acquisition
transactions or other strategic transactions that could reduce
cash available to fund our operations or result in dilution to
shareholders. In May 2005, we entered into a purchase agreement with a third
party vendor to acquire certain products and services. We were
to be invoiced for the products and services at the time of
receipt by the vendor. During the quarter ended
December31, 2005, we decided to cancel the purchase
agreement. As a result, we recorded a loss of approximately
$85million during the quarter ended December31,
2005 in 49 Table of Contents order to reflect the products and services that have been
delivered, or to which we had committed, at their net realizable
value. In October 2005, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft to
settle all antitrust disputes worldwide between the two
companies. Upon settlement of the legal disputes, we entered
into two commercial agreements with Microsoft that provide for
collaboration in digital music and games. The combined
contractual payments related to the settlement agreement and the
two commercial agreements to be made by Microsoft to us over the
terms of the agreements are approximately $7610million.
In October 2005, we received $4780million of the
scheduled contractual payments. At December31, 2005, we had $7986million in cash,
cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash
equivalents. Our principal commitments include office leases and
contractual payments due to content and other service providers.
We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our
anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital
expenditures for at least the next 12months. We do not hold derivative financial instruments or equity
securities in our short-term investment portfolio. Our cash
equivalents and short-term investments consist of high quality
securities, as specified in our investment policy guidelines.
The policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one
non-U.S.Government
or non-U.S.Agency
issue or issuer to a maximum of 5% of the total portfolio. These
securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease
in value if interest rates increase. Because we have
historically had the ability to hold our fixed income
investments until maturity, we would not expect our operating
results or cash flows to be significantly affected by a sudden
change in market interest rates in our securities portfolio. We conduct our operations in ten primary functional currencies:
the United States dollar, the Japanese yen, the British pound,
the Euro, the Mexican peso, the Brazilian real, the Australian
dollar, the Hong Kong dollar, the Singapore dollar and the
Korean won. Historically, neither fluctuations in foreign
exchange rates nor changes in foreign economic conditions have
had a significant impact on our financial condition or results
of operations. We currently do not hedge the majority of our
foreign currency exposures and are therefore subject to the risk
of exchange rate fluctuations. We invoice our international
customers primarily in U.S.dollars, except in Japan,
Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Australia, where we
invoice our customers primarily in yen, euros for Germany and
France, pounds and Australian dollars, respectively. We are
exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial
results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into
U.S.dollars in consolidation. Our exposure to foreign
exchange rate fluctuations also arises from intercompany
payables and receivables to and from our foreign subsidiaries.
Foreign exchange rate fluctuations did not have a material
impact on our financial results in 2005, 2004 and 2003. At December31, 2005, we had commitments to make the
following payments

Item7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk The following discussion about our market risk involves
forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ
materially from those projected in the forward-looking
statements. Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to interest rate risk
from changes in market interest rates relates primarily to our
short-term investment portfolio. We do not hold derivative
financial instruments or equity investments in our short-term
investment portfolio. Our short-term investments consist of high
quality debt securities as specified in our investment policy
guidelines. Investments in both fixed and floating rate
instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value
of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise
in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce
less income than expected if interest rates fall. Additionally,
a falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as
securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate,
generating less interest income. Due in part to these factors,
our future interest income may be adversely impacted due to
changes in interest rates. In addition, we may incur losses in
principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined
in market value due to changes in interest rates. Because we
have historically had the ability to hold our short-term
investments until maturity and the substantial majority of our
short-term investments mature within one year of purchase, we
would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be
significantly impacted by a sudden change in market interest
rates. There have been no material changes in our investment
methodology regarding our cash equivalents and short-term
investments during the year ended December31, 2005. The table below presents the amounts related to weighted average
interest rates and contractual maturities of our short-term
investment portfolio at December31, 2005 dollars in

Investment Risk. As of December31, 2005, we had
investments in voting capital stock of both publicly- and
privately-held technology companies for business and strategic
purposes. Some of these securities do not have a quoted market
price. Our investments in publicly traded companies are carried
at current market value and are classified as long-term as they
are strategic in nature. We periodically evaluate whether any
declines in fair value of our investments are
other-than-temporary. This evaluation consists of a review of
qualitative and quantitative factors. Based upon an evaluation
of the facts and circumstances during 2005, we determined that
an other-than-temporary impairment had occurred on one
investment, resulting in an impairment charge of
$03million, in order to reflect the investment at its
fair value. Based upon an evaluation of the facts and
circumstances during 2004, an other-than-temporary impairment
had occurred on one investment. Impairment charges of
$05million were recorded to reflect the investment at
fair value in 2004. Equity price fluctuations of plus or minus
10% of prices at December31, 2005 would have had an
approximate $43million impact on the value of our
investments in publicly traded companies at December31,
2005, related primarily to our investment in J-Stream, a
publicly traded Japanese company. 51 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Risk. We conduct business
internationally in several currencies. As such, we are exposed
to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arise in part
from: 1translation of the financial results of foreign
subsidiaries into U.S.dollars in consolidation;
2the re-measurement of non-functional currency assets,
liabilities and intercompany balances into U.S.dollars for
financial reporting purposes; and
3non-U.S.dollar
denominated sales to foreign customers. A portion of these risks is managed through the use of financial
derivatives, but fluctuations could impact our results of
operations and financial position. Generally, our practice is to manage foreign currency risk for
the majority of material short-term intercompany balances
through the use of foreign currency forward contracts. These
contracts require us to exchange currencies at rates agreed upon
at the contracts inception. Because the impact of
movements in currency exchange rates on forward contracts
offsets the related impact on the short-term intercompany
balances, these financial instruments help alleviate the risk
that might otherwise result from certain changes in currency
exchange rates. We do not designate our foreign exchange forward
contracts related to short-term intercompany accounts as hedges
and, accordingly, we adjust these instruments to fair value
through results of operations. However, we may periodically
hedge a portion of our foreign exchange exposures associated
with material firmly committed transactions, long-term
investments, highly predictable anticipated exposures and net
investments in foreign subsidiaries. Our foreign currency risk management program reduces, but does
not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate
movements. Historically, neither fluctuations in foreign exchange rates nor
changes in foreign economic conditions have had a significant
impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
Foreign exchange rate fluctuations did not have a material
impact on our financial results for the years ended
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. At December31, 2005, we had the following foreign currency

Note1.
Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies A.Description of Business. RealNetworks, Inc. and
subsidiaries RealNetworks or Company is a leading global
provider of network-delivered digital media products and
services. The Company also develops and markets software
products and services that enable the creation, distribution and
consumption of digital media, including audio and video. Inherent in the Companys business are various risks and
uncertainties, including its limited history of certain of its
product and service offerings and its limited history of
offering premium subscription services on the Internet. The
Companys success will depend on the acceptance of the
Companys technology, products and services and the ability
to generate related revenue. B.Basis of Presentation. The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain
prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation. C.Cash, Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments and
Marketable Equity Securities. The Company considers all
short-term investments with a remaining contractual maturity at
date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company has classified as available-for-sale all marketable
debt and equity securities for which there is a determinable
fair market value and there are no restrictions on the
Companys ability to sell within the next 12months.
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with
unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of
shareholders equity, net of applicable income taxes.
Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be
other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are
included in other income expense. The cost basis for
determining realized gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities is determined using the specific identification
method. D.Other Investments. The cost method is used to
account for equity investments in companies in which the Company
holds less than a 20percent voting interest, does not
exercise significant influence and the related securities do not
have a quoted market price. The Companys investment in MusicNet, Inc. MusicNet was
accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under the
equity method of accounting, the Companys share of
MusicNets earnings or net loss was included in the
Companys consolidated operating results. Because the
Company had loaned MusicNet funds and based on the nature of the
loans, the Company concluded the loans represent in-substance
common stock. Therefore, the Company recorded more than its
relative ownership share of MusicNets net losses. E.Fair Value of Financial Instruments. At
December31, 2005, the Company had the following financial
instruments: cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and
convertible debt. The carrying value of cash and cash
equivalents, investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and accrued liabilities approximates their fair value based on
the liquidity of these financial instruments or based on their
short-term nature. The fair value of convertible debt, which has
a carrying value of $100million, was approximately
$972million and $991million at December31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. F.Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes
revenue in connection with its software products pursuant to the
requirements of Statement of Position No97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition
SOP97-2, as
amended by Statement of Position No98-9, Software
Revenue Recognition with Respect to Certain Arrangements.
Some of the Companys software arrangements include
consulting implementation services sold separately under
consulting engagement contracts. Consulting revenue from 57 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued these arrangements is generally accounted for separately from
new software license revenue because the arrangements qualify as
service transactions as defined in
SOP97-2. Revenue
for consulting services is generally recognized as the services
are performed. If the Company provides consulting services that are considered
essential to the functionality of the software products, both
the software product revenue and services revenue are recognized
under contract accounting in accordance with the provisions of
SOP81-1, Accounting for Performance of
Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts.
Revenue from these arrangements is recognized under the
percentage of completion method based on the ratio of direct
labor hours
incurred-to-date to
total projected labor hours. For transactions not falling under the scope of
SOP97-2, the
Companys revenue recognition policies are in accordance
with Securities and Exchange Commission SECStaff
Accounting Bulletin SAB104, Revenue
Recognition, and the FASBs Emerging Issues Task
Force Issue
No00-21.
SAB104 was issued on December17, 2003 and supercedes
SAB101, Revenue Recognition. The adoption of
SAB104 did not materially affect the Companys
revenue recognition policies, its results of operations,
financial position or cash flows. Revenue attributable to an element in a customer arrangement is
recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and
delivery has occurred, provided the fee is fixed or
determinable, collectibility is probable and the arrangement
does not require significant customization of the software. If
at the outset of the customer arrangement, the Company
determines that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable
or that collectibility is not probable, the Company defers the
revenue and recognizes the revenue when the arrangement fee
becomes due and payable or as cash is received when
collectibility concerns exist. For multiple element arrangements when Company-specific
objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the
undelivered elements of the arrangement, but does not exist for
one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement, the
Company recognizes revenue under the residual method. Under the
residual method, at the outset of the arrangement with a
customer, the Company defers revenue for the fair value of its
undelivered elements such as consulting services and product
support and upgrades, and recognizes the revenue for the
remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements
initially delivered, such as software licenses, when the
criteria in
SOP97-2 have been
met. If specific objective evidence does not exist for an
undelivered element in a software arrangement, which may include
distribution or other term-based arrangements in which the
license fee includes support during the arrangement term,
revenue is recognized over the term of the support period
commencing upon delivery of the Companys technology to the
customer. For software license fees in single element
arrangements such as consumer software sales and music copying
or burning, revenue recognition typically occurs
when the product is made available to the customer for download
or when products are shipped to the customer, or in the case of
music burns, when the burn occurs. Revenue from software license agreements with original equipment
manufacturers OEMis recognized when the OEM delivers its
product incorporating the Companys software to the end
user. In the case of prepayments received from an OEM, the
Company generally recognizes revenue based on the actual
products sold by the OEM. If the Company provides ongoing
support to the OEM in the form of future upgrades, enhancements
or other services over the term of the contract, revenue is
generally recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Service revenue includes payments under support and upgrade
contracts, media subscription services, and fees from consulting
services and streaming media content hosting. Support and
upgrade revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the
contract, which typically is twelve months. Media subscription 58 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued service revenue is recognized ratably over the period that
services are provided, which is generally one to twelve months.
Other service revenues are recognized when the services are
performed. Fees generated from advertising appearing on the Companys
websites, and from advertising included in the Companys
products, are recognized as revenue over the terms of the
contracts. The Company may guarantee a minimum number of
advertising impressions, click-throughs or other criteria on the
Companys websites or products for a specified period. The
Company recognizes the corresponding revenue as the delivery of
the advertising occurs. G.Research and Development. Costs incurred in
research and development are expensed as incurred. Software
development costs are required to be capitalized when a
products technological feasibility has been established
through the date the product is available for general release to
customers. The Company has not capitalized any software
development costs, as technological feasibility is generally not
established until a working model is completed, at which time
substantially all development is complete. H.Stock-Based Compensation. The Company has elected
to apply the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFASNo123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS123. Accordingly, the Company accounts for
stock-based compensation transactions with employees using the
intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Options Issued
to Employees, APB25and related
interpretations. Compensation cost for employee stock options is
measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the
Companys common stock at the date of grant over the stock
option exercise price. Compensation cost for awards to
non-employees is based on the fair value of the awards in
accordance with SFAS123 and related interpretations. The Company recognizes compensation cost related to fixed
employee awards on an accelerated basis over the applicable
vesting period using the methodology described in Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASBInterpretation
No28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and
Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans. At December31, 2005, the Company had six stock-based
employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in
Note10. The Company accounts for those plans under the
recognition and measurement principles of APB25 and
related interpretations. The following table illustrates the
effect on net income loss and net income loss per share if
the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS123 to stock-based employee compensation.

STATEMENTSContinued I.Advertising Expenses. The Company expenses the
cost of advertising and promoting its products as incurred. Such
costs are included in sales and marketing expense and totaled
$400million in 2005, $130million in 2004 and
$62million in 2003. J.Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and
amortization of equipment, software and leasehold improvements
are computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of
the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three years,
or the lease term. Depreciation is recognized using the
straight-line method over the following approximate useful lives   
Useful Life   
Computer equipment and software
3years
Office furniture and equipment
3years
Leasehold improvements
2 to 10 years
Depreciation expense for the years ended December31, 2005,
2004 and 2003 was $103million, $98million and
$104million, respectively. K.Income Taxes. The Company computes income taxes
using the asset and liability method, under which deferred
income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between
the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the
Companys assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected
to be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities and
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences and operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards are expected to be recovered or
settled. L.Trade Accounts Receivable. Trade accounts
receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear
interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the
Companys best estimate of the amount of probable credit
losses in the Companys existing accounts receivable. The
Company determines the allowance based on analysis of historical
bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness
and current economic trends. The Company reviews its allowance
for doubtful accounts quarterly. Past due balances over
90days and specified other balances are reviewed
individually for collectibility. All other balances are reviewed
on an aggregate basis. Account balances are written off against
the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted
and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company
does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to
its customers. As of December31, 2005, no one customer
accounted for more than 10% of total trade accounts receivable.
As of December31, 2004 and 2003, one international
customer accounted for approximately 12% and 20%, respectively,
of the total trade accounts receivable. M.Derivative Financial Instruments. The Company
conducts business internationally in several currencies. As
such, it is exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency
exchange rates. A portion of these risks are managed through the
use of financial derivatives, but fluctuations could impact the
Companys results of operations and financial position. The
Companys foreign currency risk management program reduces,
but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange
rate movements. Generally, the Companys practice is to manage foreign
currency risk for the majority of material short-term
intercompany balances through the use of foreign currency
forward contracts. These contracts require the Company to
exchange currencies at rates agreed upon at the contracts
inception. Because the impact of movements in currency exchange
rates on forward contracts offsets the related impact on the
short-term intercompany balances, these financial instruments
help alleviate the risk that might otherwise result from certain
changes in currency exchange rates. The Company does not
designate its foreign exchange forward contracts related to
short-term intercompany accounts as hedges and, accordingly, the 60 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Company adjusts these instruments to fair value through results
of operations. However, the Company may periodically hedge a
portion of its foreign exchange exposures associated with
material firmly committed transactions and long-term investments. All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or
not, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the
derivative is designated a hedge, then depending on the nature
of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be recorded
immediately in results of operations, or be recognized in other
comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in
results of operations. The following foreign currency contracts were outstanding and
recorded at fair value in thousands

No derivative instruments which were designated as hedges for
accounting purposes were outstanding at December31, 2005
and 2004. N.Net Income Loss Per Share. Basic net income
loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted net income loss per share is computed by
dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of
common and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during
the period. As the Company had a net loss in 2004 and 2003,
basic and diluted net loss per share are the same for those
periods. Potentially dilutive securities outstanding were not
included in the computation of diluted net loss per common share 61 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued because to do so would have been anti-dilutive. The share count

common shares with a weighted average exercise price of
$713per share and approximately 108million
contingently issuable common shares related to convertible debt
described in Note10. Potentially dilutive securities for
the year ended December31, 2003 included options to
purchase approximately 366million common shares with a
weighted average exercise price of $705per share and
approximately 108million contingently issuable common
shares related to convertible debt. O.Comprehensive Income Loss. The Companys
comprehensive income loss for 2005, 2004 and 2003 consisted of
net income loss, unrealized gains losses on marketable
securities and the gross amount of foreign currency translation
gains losses. The tax effect of the foreign currency
translation gains losses and unrealized gains losses on
investments has been taken into account, if applicable. The components of accumulated other comprehensive income are as

P.Foreign Currency. The Company considers the
functional currency of its foreign subsidiaries to be the local
currency of the country in which the subsidiary operates. Assets
and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into
U.S.dollars using rates of exchange in effect at the end
of the reporting period. Income and expense accounts are
translated into U.S.dollars using average rates of
exchange. The net gain or loss resulting from translation is
shown as translation adjustment and included in accumulated
other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity.
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included
in the consolidated statements of operations. There were no
significant gains or losses on foreign currency transactions in
2005, 2004 and 2003. Q.Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and 62 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. R.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS144
provides a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be
disposed of. SFAS144 also changes the criteria for
classifying an asset as held for sale, and broadens the scope of
businesses to be disposed of that qualify for reporting as
discontinued operations and changes the timing of recognizing
losses on such operations. In accordance with SFAS144, the Company reviews its
long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets held and used is
measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to
estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their
fair value. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented on
the balance sheet and reported at the lower of their carrying
amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer
depreciated. S.Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value
of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in business combinations accounted for under
the purchase method. Goodwill and intangible assets not subject
to amortization are tested annually for impairment, and are
tested for impairment more frequently if events and
circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Factors
the Company considers important which could trigger an
impairment review include the following   
poor economic performance relative to historical or projected
future operating results     
significant negative industry, economic or company specific
trends     
changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the plans for
our business;and     
loss of key personnel. In accordance with SFAS142, we review our goodwill for
impairment annually, or more frequently, if facts and
circumstances warrant a review. The provisions of SFAS142
require a two-step test be performed to assess goodwill for
impairment. First, the fair value of each reporting unit is
compared to its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the
carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing
is performed. The second step is performed if the carrying value
exceeds the fair value. The implied fair value of the reporting
units goodwill must be determined and compared to the
carrying value of the goodwill. If the carrying value of a
reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value,
an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded. In
the fourth quarters of 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company
performed a similar test to that described above in connection
with its annual impairment test required under SFAS142. In
each period tested, the implied fair value of the reporting
units exceeded their respective carrying amounts, which
supported that goodwill was not impaired and no further testing
was required. T.Reclassifications. Certain reclassifications have
been made to the 2004 and 2003 consolidated financial statements
to conform to the 2005 presentation. U.New Accounting Pronouncements. In December 2004,
the FASB issued SFASNo123 revised 2004,
Share-Based Payment SFAS123R, which requires
the measurement of all share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, using a
fair-value-based method and the recording of such expense in an
entitys statement of income. The Company adopted the
provisions of SFAS123R on January1, 2006. The pro
forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS123 no
longer will be an alternative to financial statement
recognition. See Stock-Based Compensation
Note1 H for the pro forma net income loss and net
income loss per share amounts, for the years ended 63 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, as if the Company had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS123
to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive

2006, the Company will recognize stock-based compensation using
the modified prospective method and expects the adoption to have
a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial
statements.

Business Combinations: Goodwill Intangible
Assets   
A. Business Combination in 2005. On May6, 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
securities of Mr.Goodliving Ltd. Mr.Goodliving, in
exchange for approximately $156million in cash payments.
Included in the purchase price is $05million in estimated
acquisition-related expenditures consisting primarily of
professional fees. In addition, the Company may be obligated to
pay up to $16million over a four-year period to certain
Mr.Goodliving employees in the form of a management
incentive plan if certain performance criteria are achieved.
Such amounts are not included in the aggregate purchase price
and, to the extent earned, will be recorded as compensation
expense over the related employment periods. The accrued
compensation cost related to this plan was approximately
$03million for the year ended December31, 2005 and
is included in the consolidated balance sheet in accrued and
other liabilities. Mr.Goodliving is a developer and publisher of mobile games
located in Helsinki, Finland. The Company believes that
combining Mr.Goodlivings assets and distribution
network with the Companys downloadable, PC-based games
assets and distribution platform will enhance the Companys
entry into the mobile games market. The results of
Mr.Goodlivings operations are included in the
Companys consolidated financial statements starting from

B. Business Combination in 2004. In January 2004, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
securities of GameHouse, Inc. GameHouse in exchange for
approximately $91million in cash payments, including an
estimated future payment of $01million to cover certain
tax obligations of the selling shareholders, and
30million shares and options to acquire 03million
shares of RealNetworks common stock valued at approximately
$209million. The value assigned to the stock portion of
the purchase price was $640per share based on the average
closing price of RealNetworks common stock for the five
days beginning two days prior to and ending two days after
January26, 2004 the date of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger. Options issued were valued based on the Black-Scholes
options pricing model. Included in the purchase price is
$04million in acquisition-related expenditures consisting
primarily of professional fees. Certain former GameHouse
shareholders are eligible to receive up to $55million
over a four-year period, payable in cash or, at the
Companys discretion, in RealNetworks common stock valued
in that amount provided they remain employed by RealNetworks
during such period. In addition, the Company may be obligated to
pay up to $10million over a four-year period to certain
GameHouse employees in the form of a management incentive plan.
Such amounts are not included in the aggregate purchase price
and, to the extent earned, are being recorded as compensation
expense over the related employment periods. GameHouse is a developer, publisher and distributor of
downloadable PC and mobile games. The Company believes that
combining GameHouses assets with RealNetworks
subscription games service and downloadable games distribution
platform will strengthen the Companys position in the PC
games market. The results of GameHouses operations are

C. Business Combination in 2003. In August 2003, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
securities of Listen in exchange for approximately
$188million in cash payments, including a
$15million payment made in January 2004 based on the
achievement of a specified milestone, and 38million
shares and 04million options to acquire shares of
RealNetworks common stock valued at $194million. The
value assigned to the stock portion of the purchase price was
$472per share based on the average closing price of
RealNetworks common stock for the five days beginning two
days prior to and ending two days after April21, 2003 the
date of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization.
Options issued were valued based on the Black-Scholes options
pricing model. Included in the purchase price is
$07million in acquisition-related expenditures consisting
primarily of professional fees. In addition, as of the
acquisition date, RealNetworks had invested $73million in
Listen in the form of convertible promissory notes that became a
part of the purchase consideration. The cash balance at Listen
on the acquisition date was $49million. As part of the
acquisition, a management incentive plan was established whereby
certain employees of Listen could be entitled over a two-year
period to receive payments in cash or stock having a value of up
to $30million. Listen operated an on-demand and premium, commercial-free music
subscription service for which it charged monthly subscription
fees. It also provided its subscribers with the ability to copy
or burn music to compact discs for which it charged
a per-track fee. The Company believed that combining the
services of Listen with the Companys digital music assets
and distribution network would enable the Company to create a
compelling digital music experience. The results of
Listens operations are included in the Companys
consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. 68 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Note5.
Equity Investments RealNetworks has made minority equity investments for business
and strategic purposes through the purchase of voting capital
stock of companies. The Companys investments in publicly
traded companies are available for sale, carried at current
market value and are classified as long-term. The Company
periodically evaluates whether declines in fair value, if any,
of its investments are other-than-temporary. This evaluation
consists of a review of qualitative and quantitative factors.
For investments with publicly quoted market prices, these
factors include the time period and extent by which its
accounting basis exceeds its quoted market price. The Company
also considers other factors to determine whether declines in
fair value are other-than-temporary, such as the investees
financial condition, results of operations and operating trends.
The evaluation also considers publicly available information
regarding the investee companies. For investments in private
companies with no quoted market price, the Company considers
similar qualitative and quantitative factors and also considers
the implied value from any recent rounds of financing completed
by the investee. Based upon an evaluation of the facts and
circumstances during 2005, the Company determined that an
other-than-temporary decline in fair value had occurred in one
of its privately-held investments, resulting in an impairment
charge of $03million to reflect changes in the fair value
of the investment in the results of operations. Based upon an
evaluation of the facts and circumstances during 2004, the
Company determined that other-than-temporary declines in fair
value had occurred in one of its privately-held investments
resulting in an impairment charge of $05million to
reflect changes in the fair value of this investment in the
results of operations. Based upon an evaluation of the facts and
circumstances during 2003, the Company determined that
other-than-temporary declines in fair value had occurred in two
of its publicly traded investments resulting in impairment
charges of $04million to reflect changes in the fair
value of these investments in the results of operations. The effects of these impairments on cost and carrying value are
incorporated into the values below. A summary of the investments
is as follows in thousands

Privately held investments include investments accounted for
using the cost and equity methods. As of December31, 2005, the Company owned marketable
equity securities of J-Stream Inc., a Japanese media services
company, representing approximately 106% of J-Streams
outstanding shares. These securities are accounted for by the
Company as available-for-sale securities. The market value of
these shares has increased from the Companys original cost
of approximately $09million, resulting in a carrying
value of $434million and $331million at
December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase over
the Companys cost basis, net of tax effects is
$289million and $152million at December31,
2005 and December31, 2004, respectively, and is reflected
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The
Company recently disposed of a portion of its investment in
J-Stream, through open market trades, which resulted in net
proceeds of approximately $119million, for which the 70 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Company recognized a gain, net of tax, of approximately
$84million during the year ended December31, 2005.
The disposition resulted in a tax expense and a related offset
to accumulated other comprehensive income of $33million
during the year ended December31, 2005. There were no
similar gains or losses in 2004 or 2003. The disposition reduced
the Companys ownership interest from approximately 135%
to 106%. The market for J-Streams shares is relatively
limited and the share price is volatile. Although the carrying
value of the Companys investment in J-Stream was
approximately $434million at December31, 2005,
there can be no assurance that a gain of this magnitude, or any
gain, can be realized through the disposition of these shares.   
Note6.
Investment in MusicNet The Companys investment in MusicNet, a joint venture with
several media companies to create a platform for online music
subscription services, was accounted for under the equity method
of accounting. On April12, 2005, the Company disposed of
all of its preferred shares and convertible notes in MusicNet to
a private equity firm, Baker Capital, in connection with the
sale of all of the capital stock of MusicNet. The Company
received approximately $72million of cash proceeds in
connection with the closing of the transaction and received an
additional $04million in connection with the expiration
of an escrow arrangement in August 2005. The Company also has
the right to receive up to an additional $23million in
cash upon the expiration of an indemnity escrow arrangement
which expires on the one-year anniversary of the transaction
date. The Company recorded in its statement of operations its equity
share of MusicNets net loss through the date of
disposition, which was $11million, $44million and
$54million for the years ended December31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively. For purposes of calculating the
Companys equity in net loss of MusicNet, the convertible
notes were treated on an as if converted basis due
to the nature and terms of the convertible notes. As a result,
the losses recorded by the Company represented approximately
361% of MusicNets net losses through the date of
disposition in 2005 and 361% and 369% for the years ended
December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As of
December31, 2005, the Company no longer held an ownership
interest in MusicNet. As of December31, 2004, the
Companys ownership interest in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of MusicNet was approximately 249%. The Company
recognized approximately $09million, $07million
and $11million of revenue in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, related to license and services agreements with
MusicNet.

Loss on Excess Office Facilities and Content Agreement In October 2000, the Company entered into a
10-year lease agreement
for additional office space located near its corporate
headquarters in Seattle, Washington. During 2001, the Company
re-evaluated its 71 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued facilities requirements and, as a result, decided to permanently
sublet all of this office space. The market for office space in
Seattle has significantly declined from the date the Company
entered into this lease. As a result, the Company recorded
losses of $222million during the year ended
December31, 2001. For the year ended December31,
2001, these losses represented approximately $152million
of rent and operating expenses over the remaining life of the
lease, net of expected sublease income of $381million,
and approximately $70million for the write-down of
leasehold improvements to their estimated fair value. The
Companys estimates were based upon many factors including
projections of sublease rates and the time period required to
locate tenants. During the year ended December31, 2002,
the Seattle real estate market continued to display significant
weakness, which was reflected in both increasing vacancy rates
and declining rental rates. Based on discussions with
prospective tenants, the Company concluded that the excess
office facilities were not likely to be sublet at rates used in
the original loss estimates. As a result, the Company recorded
additional losses of $172million during the year ended
December31, 2002. During 2003, the Company secured an
additional tenant at a sublease rate lower than the rate used in
previous loss estimates. As a result, the Company adjusted its
estimates to reflect the lower lease rate and recorded an
additional loss of $71million. The loss estimate as of
December31, 2005 includes $125million of expected
future sublease income, which is committed under current
sublease contracts. The Company did not identify any factors
which caused it to revise its estimates during the years ended
December31, 2005 and 2004. The Company also recorded an
accrual for estimated future losses on excess office facilities
in its allocation of the Listen purchase price. The Company
regularly evaluates the market for office space. If the market
for such space declines further in future periods or if the
Company is unable to sublease the space based on its current
estimates, the Company may have to revise its estimates, which
may result in additional losses on excess office facilities.
Although the Company believes its estimates are reasonable,
additional losses may result if actual experience differs from
projections. During the quarter ended September30, 2004, the Company
renegotiated its existing lease for the Companys
headquarters building. In addition, the Company ceased use of
approximately 16,000square feet of office space, which was
returned to the landlord in May 2005 in accordance with the
amended lease agreement. The Company recorded a loss on excess
office facilities of approximately $09million related to
the expensing of net leasehold improvements and rent for the
period between October1, 2004 and April30, 2005 in
connection with the excess space the Company vacated as of
September30, 2004. During the quarter ended March31, 2004, the Company
cancelled a content licensing agreement with one of its content
partners. Under the terms of the cancellation agreement, the
Company gave up rights to use the content and ceased using the
content in any of its products or services as of March31,
2004. The resulting expense of $49million represents the
estimated fair value of payments to be made in accordance with
the terms of the cancellation agreement. 72 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Convertible Debt During 2003, the Company issued $100million aggregate
principal amount of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes
due July1, 2010, pursuant to Rule144A under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes are subordinated
to any Company senior debt, and are also effectively
subordinated in right of payment to all indebtedness and other
liabilities of its subsidiaries. The notes are convertible into
shares of the Companys common stock based on an initial
effective conversion price of approximately $930 if
1the closing sale price of the Companys common
stock exceeds $1023, subject to certain restrictions,
2the notes are called for redemption, 3the
Company makes a significant distribution to its shareholders or
becomes a party to a transaction that would result in a change
in control, or 4the trading price of the notes falls
below 95% of the value of common stock that the notes are
convertible into, subject to certain restrictions; one of which
allows the Company, at its discretion, to issue cash or common
stock or a combination thereof upon conversion. On or after
July1, 2008, the Company has the option to redeem all or a
portion of the notes that have not been previously purchased,
repurchased or converted, in exchange for cash at 100% of the
principal amount of the notes. The purchaser may require the
Company to purchase all or a portion of its notes in cash on
July1, 2008 at 100% of the principal amount of the notes.
As a result of this issuance, the Company received proceeds of

are included in other assets and are being amortized over a
5-year period. Interest
expense from the amortization of offering costs in the amount of
$06million, $06million and $03million is
recorded in interest income, net for the years ended
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Shareholders Equity A.Preferred Stock. Each share of SeriesA
preferred stock entitles the holder to one thousand votes and
dividends equal to one thousand times the aggregate per share
amount of dividends declared on the common stock. There are no
shares of SeriesA preferred stock outstanding. 73 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Undesignated preferred stock will have rights and preferences
that are determinable by the Board of Directors when
determination of a new series of preferred stock has been
established. B.Shareholder Rights Plan. On October16,
1998, the Companys board of directors declared a dividend
of one preferred share purchase right Right in connection with

common stock issued after the Record Date will be issued with an
attached Right. The Rights will not immediately be exercisable
and detachable from the common stock. The Rights will become

person or a group of 15percent or more of the outstanding
common stock or ten days following the announcement of a tender
or exchange offer for 15percent or more of the outstanding
common stock Distribution Date. After the Distribution Date,
each Right will entitle the holder to purchase for $3750
Exercise Price, a fraction of a share of the Companys
SeriesA preferred stock with economic terms similar to
that of one share of the Companys common stock. Upon a
person or a group acquiring 15percent or more of the
outstanding common stock, each Right will allow the holder
other than the acquirer to purchase common stock or securities
of the Company having a then current market value of two times
the Exercise Price of the Right. In the event that following the
acquisition of 15percent of the common stock by an
acquirer, the Company is acquired in a merger or other business
combination or 50percent or more of the Companys
assets or earning power are sold, each Right will entitle the
holder to purchase for the Exercise Price, common stock or
securities of the acquirer having a then current market value of
two times the Exercise Price. In certain circumstances, the
Rights may be redeemed by the Company at a redemption price of
$00025per Right. If not earlier exchanged or redeemed,
the Rights will expire on December4, 2008. C.Equity Compensation Plans. The Company has six
equity compensation plans Plans to compensate employees and
Directors for past and future services and has reserved
approximately 891million shares of common stock for
option grants under the Plans. Generally, options vest based on
continuous employment, over a four or five-year period. The
options expire in either seven, ten or twenty years from the
date of grant and are exercisable at the fair market value of
the common stock at the grant date. 74 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

E.Repurchase of Common Stock. In September 2001,
the Company announced a share repurchase program to repurchase
of up to an aggregate of $50million of its outstanding

aggregate of $100million of the Companys outstanding
common stock, which replaced the August 2005 repurchase 76 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued program. The repurchases may be made from time to time,
depending on market conditions, share price and other factors.
Repurchases may be made in the open market or through private
transactions, in accordance with Securities and Exchange
Commission requirements. The Company entered into a
Rule10b5-1 plan designed to facilitate the repurchase of
the authorized repurchase amount. In addition, the repurchase
program does not require RealNetworks to acquire a specific
number of shares and may be terminated under certain conditions.
During 2005, under the August 2005 repurchase program the
Company repurchased approximately 58million shares at an
average cost of $536 for an aggregate value of approximately

Income taxes currently payable at December31, 2005 were
approximately $95million. The Company records a valuation
allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the
ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate
character in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions. Based on an
evaluation of expected future taxable income in 2006 and 2007
related primarily to the Companys settlement with
Microsoft Corporation outlined in Note13C, the Company
determined it is 78 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will be
realized and therefore reversed the related valuation allowance
on these assets in the fourth quarter of 2005. The Company has
continued to provide a valuation allowance on the deferred tax
assets that the Company has determined will more likely than not
remain unutilized. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets increased
decreasedby $2204million, $104million
and $229million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
During 2005, $75million of the reduction was recorded to
goodwill due to the release of valuation allowance on net
operating losses from acquired subsidiaries. In addition, a
credit of $1702million was recorded to additional
paid-in-capital during
2005 to reflect the use of net operating losses derived from the
benefit of stock option exercises for tax purposes. Of the
remaining release of valuation allowance in 2005, approximately
$420million was reflected in the Companys
consolidated statement of operations. The Companys net operating loss carryforwards totaled
$1882million and $5910million at December31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. These net operating loss
carryforwards begin to expire between 2010 and 2024. In
addition, utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards
may be subject to certain limitations under Section382 of
the Internal Revenue Code. Of the total net operating losses,
approximately $481million relate to net operating loss
carryforwards from acquired subsidiaries that are limited under
Internal Revenue Code Section382. In the event that the
Company generates taxable income to utilize these net operating
loss carryforwards, goodwill will be reduced by approximately
$89million. The Company has $71million of research
and development credit carryforwards which will expire between
2010 and 2023. The Company has not provided for U.S.deferred income taxes
or withholding taxes on
non-U.S.subsidiaries
undistributed earnings. These earnings are intended to be
permanently reinvested in operations outside of the United
States. If these amounts were distributed to the United States,
in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be
subject to additional U.S.income taxes. The determination
of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax income tax
liabilities on these earnings is not practicable.   
Note12.

settle all antitrust disputes worldwide with Microsoft,
including the United States litigation. Upon settlement of the

by Friskit, Inc. Friskit, alleging that certain features of
the Companys and Listens products and services
willfully infringe certain patents relating to allowing users
to search for streaming media files, to create custom
playlists, and to listen to the streaming media file
sequentially and continuously. Friskit seeks to enjoin the
Company from the alleged infringing activity and to recover
treble damages from the alleged infringement. The Company has
filed its answer and a counterclaim against Friskit challenging
the validity of the patents at issue. The trial court has also
granted the Companys motion to transfer the action to the
Northern District of California. The Company disputes
Friskits allegations in this action and intends to
vigorously defend itself. In July 2002, a lawsuit was filed against the Company in federal
court in Boston, Massachusetts by Ethos Technologies, Inc.
Ethos, alleging that the Company willfully infringes certain
patents relating to the downloading of data from a server
computer to a client computer. Ethos seeks to enjoin the
Company from the alleged infringing activity and to recover
treble damages from the alleged infringement. The Company has
filed counterclaims against Ethos seeking a declaratory judgment
that the patents at issue are invalid and unenforceable due to
Ethos inequitable conduct, as well as its recovery of
damages for Ethos infringement of a Company patent, and
reasonable attorneys fees and costs. The Company disputes
Ethos allegations in this action and intends to vigorously
defend itself. The case has been scheduled for trial beginning
in March 2006. In August 2005, a lawsuit was filed against the Company in the
U.S.District Court for the District of Maryland by Ho
Keung Tse, an individual residing in Hong Kong. The suit alleges
that certain of the Companys products and services
infringe the plaintiffs patent relating to the
distribution of digital files, including sound tracks, music,
video and executable software in a manner which restricts
unauthorized use. The plaintiff seeks to enjoin the
Company from the allegedly infringing activity and to recover
treble damages for the alleged infringement. The Company has not
yet been served with process in the suit. In October 2005, the
Companys co-defendant moved to transfer the lawsuit from
the District of Maryland to the Northern District of California.
The Company disputes the plaintiffs allegations in the
action and intends to vigorously defend itself. From time to time the Company is, and expects to continue to be,
subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course
of its business, including employment claims, contract-related
claims and claims of alleged infringement of third-party
patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights.
These claims, including those described above, even if not
meritorious, could force the Company to spend significant
financial and managerial resources. The Company is not aware of
any legal proceedings or claims that the Company believes will
have, individually or taken together, a material adverse effect
on the Companys business, prospects, financial condition
or results of operations. However, the Company may incur
substantial expenses in defending against third party claims and
certain pending claims are moving closer to trial. The Company
expects that its potential costs of defending these claims may
increase as the disputes move into the trial phase of the
proceedings. In the event of a determination adverse to the
Company, the Company may incur substantial monetary liability,
and/or be required to change its business 84 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued practices. Either of these could have a material adverse effect
on the Companys financial position and results of
operations.

Companys customer license and service agreements are
generally consistent with those prevalent in the Companys
industry. The duration of the Companys product warranties
generally does not exceed 90days following delivery of the
Companys products. The Company has not incurred
significant obligations under customer indemnification or
warranty provisions historically and does not expect to incur
significant obligations in the future. Accordingly, the Company
does not maintain accruals for potential customer
indemnification or warranty-related obligations.

RealNetworks, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2005
and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive income loss, shareholders equity and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2005. In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
financial statement schedule listed in the index at 
a2. These consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of RealNetworks, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2005, in conformity
with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. Also in
our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of RealNetworks, Inc.s internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated
March10, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of, and the effective operation of,
internal control over financial reporting.   
/s/ KPMG LLP Seattle, Washington March10, 2006 87 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders RealNetworks, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting, appearing under Item9A, that
RealNetworks, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that RealNetworks,
Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
Also, in our opinion, RealNetworks, Inc. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of RealNetworks, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
income loss, shareholders equity and cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December31,
2005, and our report dated March10, 2006 expressed an
unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
