AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Business BroadVision,Inc. collectively with its subsidiaries, BroadVision or we was incorporated in the state of Delaware on May13, 1993 and has been a publicly traded corporation since 1996. We develop, market, and support enterprise portal applications that enable companies to unify their e-business infrastructure and conduct both interactions and transactions with employees, partners, and customers through a personalized self-service model that increases revenues, reduces costs, and improves productivity. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include our and our subsidiaries accounts. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain assumptions and estimates that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the reasonableness of our estimates, including those related to receivable reserves, stock-based compensation, investments, income taxes and restructuring, as well as contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates using different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Overview Our revenue consists of fees for licenses of our software products, maintenance, consulting services and training. Our revenue recognition policies comply with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 985-605, Software: Revenue Recognition, and Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB 104, Revenue Recognition. In October 2009, the FASB amended the accounting standards in Accounting Standards Update ASU 2009-13 an update to ASC 605-25 ASU 2009-13 for certain multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to: 1 provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated, and how the consideration should be allocated; 2 require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using best estimated selling price BESP of deliverables if a vendor does not have VSOE of selling price or third-party evidence TPE of selling price; and 3 eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method. We adopted ASU 2009-13 at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The application of these new accounting standards did not have a material impact on total net revenues for fiscal year 2011. We recognize revenue when all four of the following revenue recognition criteria have been met:  Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  We have delivered the product or performed the service  The fee is fixed or determinable; and  Collection is probable. We qualify the second of the above listed criteria differently for different types of revenues, as follows. Software License Revenue, Non-Subscription and Non-Hosted Products Delivery of non-subscription and non-hosted software products is considered to have occurred when title to the physical media and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier. In case of electronic delivery, delivery occurs when the customer is given access to the licensed programs. For products that cannot be used without a licensing key, the delivery requirement is met when the licensing key is made available to the  24 customer.We do not grant a right of return for non-subscription or non-hosted software products.We recognize revenue upon delivery of our software. Software License Revenue, Subscription Products or Hosted Products Although we made the software available to the customer at a particular point in time, the delivery of subscription software products such as QuickSilver and hosted software products such as Clearvale and Clear is considered to have occurred ratably over the duration of the contract.We recognize revenue ratably. Services Revenues Consulting services revenues and training revenues are recognized as such services are performed.These services are not essential to the functionality of the software. We record reimbursement from our customers for out-of-pocket expenses as an increase to services revenues. Maintenance revenue, which includes revenue that is derived from software license agreements that entitle the customers to technical support and future unspecified enhancements to our products, is recognized ratably over the related agreement period, which time period is generally twelve months. Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Short-term Investments We consider all debt with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Short-term investments consist of debt that has a remaining maturity of less than one year as of the date of the balance sheet. Management determines the appropriate classification of short-term investments at the time of purchase and evaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. All short-term investments to date have been classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair market value,on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our held-to-maturity securities did not have any gross unrealized gains and losses as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Our short-term investments contractual maturities occurbefore December 2014.Total interest income during fiscal years 2013 and 2012 was $135,000 and $392,000, respectively. Research and Development and Software Development Costs ASC 985-20, Cost of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Marketed ASC 985-20, requires capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility. Based on our product development process, technological feasibility is established upon the completion of a working model. To date, costs incurred by us from the completion of the working model to the point at which the product is ready for general release have been insignificant. Accordingly, we have charged all such costs to research and development expenses in the period incurred. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense, which is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss, amounted to $28,000 and $75,000 in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Receivable Reserves Occasionally, our customers experience financial difficulty after we recognize the revenue but before payment has been received. We maintain receivable reserves for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Our normal payment terms are generally 30 to 90days from the invoice date. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make the contractual payments, additional reserves may be required. Losses from customer receivables in the two-year period ended December 31, 2013, have not been significant. If all efforts to collect a receivable fail, and the receivable is considered uncollectible, such receivable would be written off against the receivable reserve. Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments with high-quality institutions. Our management performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and requires certain of these customers to provide security deposits or letters of credit. Cash deposits and cash equivalents in foreign countries of approximately $64 million on December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, are subject to local banking laws and may bear higher or lower risk than cash deposited in the United States. As part of our  25 cash and investment management processes, we perform periodic evaluations of the credit standing of the financial institutions and we have not sustained any credit losses from instruments held at these financial institutions. From time to time, our financial instruments maintained in our foreign subsidiaries may be subject to political risks or instability that may arise in foreign countries where we operate. No customers accounted for 10% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. Restructuring Through June 30, 2012, we approved certain restructuring plans to, among other things, reduce our workforce and consolidate facilities. Restructuring and asset impairment charges were recorded where we aligned our cost structure with changing market conditions and to create a more efficient organization. Our restructuring charges are comprised primarily of: 1lease termination costs and/or costs associated with permanently vacating and sub-leasing our facilities; and 2other incremental costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring plan. We account for each of these costs in accordance with ASC 420-10, Exit or Disposal of Cost Obligations ASC 420-10. We record the costs associated with lease termination and/or abandonment when the leased property has no substantive future use or benefit to us. We record the liability associated with lease termination and/or abandonment as the sum of the total remaining lease costs and related exit costs, less probable sublease income. Under ASC 420-10, we record a liability for lease termination and/or abandonment cost initially at fair value on the cease-use date of that facility. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives generally two years for software, three years for computer equipment and four years for furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the remaining life of the lease term or their estimated useful lives. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations in the period realized. Fair Value of Financial Instruments We adopted the provisions of ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement ASC 820-10.ASC 820-10 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements by establishing a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level1 measurements and lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level3 measurements. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below  Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. We measurethe following financial assets at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of these financial assets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 in thousandswereas follows Fair Value atReporting Date Using Quoted Prices in Active Markets Significant for Other Significant Identical Observable Unobservable December 31 Assets Inputs Inputs  26 2013 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Cash and cash equivalents Cash 36,814 36,814   Money market funds 51 51   Total cash and cash equivalents 36,865 36,865   Fixed income securities Corporate bonds - financial 7,227  7,227  International bonds - financial 2,308  2,308  Total fixed income securities 9,535  9,535  Fair Value atReporting Date Using Quoted Prices in Active Markets Significant for Other Significant Identical Observable Unobservable December 31 Assets Inputs Inputs 2012 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Cash and cash equivalents Cash 23,010 23,010   Money market funds 779 779   Total cash and cash equivalents 23,789 23,789   Fixed income securities Certificates of deposits 22,191  22,191  Corporate bonds - financial 4,303  4,303  Corporate bonds - industrial 1,998  1,998  Total fixed income securities 28,492  28,492  Level 2 securities are priced using quoted market prices for similar instruments, nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data, or discounted cash flow techniques. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable for all periods presented approximates their respective carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these balances. Employee Benefit Plans Amended and Restated 2006 Equity Incentive Plan: At our 2006 annual meeting held on August 8, 2006, our stockholders approved the adoption of our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan the Equity Plan. At that time, our 1996 Equity Incentive Plan the Prior Equity Plan was terminated and replaced by the Equity Plan. On January 21, 2009, our Board of Directors adopted the Amended and Restated BroadVision, Inc. 2006 Equity Incentive Plan the Amended and Restated Plan, which was subsequently approved by our stockholders on April 30, 2009.The Amended and Restated Plan includes an evergreen provision that provides for automatic annual increases in the number of shares authorized for issuance.As of December 31, 2013, we had 889,064 shares of our Common Stock reserved for issuance under the plan.In addition, the number of shares of our Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan will  27 automatically increase on January 1st of each year for a period of ten years, commencing on January 1, 2010 and ending on and including January 1, 2019. Further, our Board of Directors may grant incentive or nonqualified stock options at prices not less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock, as determined by the Board of Directors, at the date of grant. The vesting of individual options may vary but in each case at least 20% of the total number of shares subject to vesting will become exercisable per year. These options generally expire ten years after the grant date. 2000 Non-Officer Plan: In February 2000, we adopted our 2000 Non-Officer Plan under which 106,666 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance to selected employees, consultants, and our affiliates who are not Officers or Directors. As of December 31, 2013, we had 66,225 shares available for issuance under the 2000 Non-Officer Plan. Under the 2000 Non-Officer Plan, we may grant non-statutory stock options at prices not less than 85% of the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant. Options granted under the 2000 Non-Officer Plan generally vest over two years and are exercisable for not more than ten years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan: We also have a compensatory Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan that enables employees to purchase, through payroll deductions, shares of our common stock at a discount from the market price of the stock at the time of purchase. The Board of Directors has authorized sequential one-year offerings beginning on July 1 of each year and extending until June 30 of the following year.Commencing on the first day of the fiscal year that begins on January 1, 2004 and ending on and including the first day of the fiscal year that begins on January 1, 2014 each such day, a Calculation Date, our Purchase Plan reserved shares can be increased by a number equal to the lesser of i one and one-half percent 15% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on each such Calculation Date rounded down to the nearest whole share; or ii thirty two thousand 32,000 shares of Common Stock. As of December 31, 2013, we had 199,394 shares available for issuance under the Purchase Plan. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock with a value equivalent to a percentage of the employee earnings, not to exceed the lesser of 15% of the employee earnings or $25,000, at a price equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the offering or the date of purchase. In accordance with ASC 718-10, Compensation Stock Compensation ASC 718-10, we record stock-based compensation expense related to the fair value of the employee purchase rights in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. During 2013 and 2012, we received a total of $382,000 and $395,000, respectively, primarily from the purchase of shares under the Purchase Plan. Stock-Based Compensation Under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718-10, share-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated pre-vesting forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period of the award. In addition, the adoption of ASC 718-10 requires additional accounting related to the income tax effects and disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from share-based payment arrangements. Calculating share-based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the share-based awards, stock price volatility, dividend yield, risk free interest rates, and pre-vesting forfeitures. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected pre-vesting forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our share-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period. The total amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 is as follows in thousands Years Ended December 31 2013 2012 Cost of services 91 94 Research and development 155 160 Sales and marketing 334 236 General and administrative 117 122 697 612 We adopted the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation pursuant to ASC 718-10. The alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool APIC pool related to the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of ASC 718-10.  28 The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model based on assumptions noted in the following table below. The expected term of our options represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding based on the simplified method provided for in SAB 107, as amended by SAB No110, Share-Based Payment.Because we do not have sufficient historical exercise data,we used the simplified method for estimating the stock option expected term.The risk-free interest rate for periods related to the expected life of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected volatility is based on historical volatilities of our stock over the expected life of the option. The expected dividend yield is zero, as we do not anticipate paying dividends in the near future. The following assumptions were used to determine stock-based compensation during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 Years Ended December 31 2013 2012 Expected volatility 69 75 Expected dividends 0 0 Expected term in years 625 year 625 year Risk free interest rate 2 1 The following assumptions were used to determine the expense related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan Years Ended December 31 2013 2012 Expected volatility 38 89 Weighted average volatility 38 92 Risk-free interest rate 0 0 Expected term in years 1 year 1 year Expected dividend yield 0 0 The weighted-average fair value of the purchase rights granted in the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012, were $22 and $450, respectively. Earnings Per Share Information Basic loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and, when dilutive, common equivalent shares from outstanding stock options using the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the basic and diluted net loss per share computational data for the periods presented in thousands, except per share amounts Years Ended December 31 2013 2012 Net Loss 5,422 5,052 Weighted-average common shares outstanding used to compute basic and diluted loss per share 4,713 4,638 Basic and diluted loss per share 115 109 Foreign Currency Transactions The functional currencies of all foreign subsidiaries are the local currencies of the respective countries. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency assets and liabilities are  29 included as other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, translation loss income was $2,000 and $160,000, respectively, and is included in other comprehensive loss incomeaccount in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholder Equity. Comprehensive Loss Comprehensive loss includes net loss and other comprehensive loss income, which consist of cumulative translation adjustments. Total accumulated other comprehensive loss is displayed as a separate component of Consolidated Statement of Stockholder Equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accumulated balance of other comprehensive loss, only consisting of foreign currency translation, net of taxes is as follows in thousands Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Balance, December 31, 2012 854 Net Change during period 2 Balance, December 31, 2013 856 Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets Income taxes are computed using an asset and liability approach in accordance with ASC 740-10,Income Taxes ASC 740-10, which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of the enacted tax law; the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, is not expected to be realized. We analyze our deferred tax assets with regard to potential realization. We have established a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets to the extent that management has determined that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized based upon the uncertainty of their realization. Weconsider the effects of estimated future taxable income, current economic conditions and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance. Segment and Geographic Information We operate in one segment, electronic commerce business solutions. Our CEO is our chief operating decision maker. The CEO reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic region and by product for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standard Board FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income - Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, The amendments do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements. These amendments require an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. For other amounts that are not required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional details about those amounts. For public entities, the amendments are effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2012. The adoption of this amendment has not resulted in any material changes to our Consolidated Financial Statements disclosure. In March 2013, the FASB issued guidance on a parents accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity. This new guidance requires that the parent release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2014. We do not anticipate material impacts on our Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption.  30 Note2 Property and Equipment Property and equipment consisted of the following in thousands December 31 2013 2012 Furniture and fixtures 187 161 Computer and software 3,088 3,329 Leasehold improvements 205 209 Total property and equipment 3,480 3,699 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization 3,238 3,393 Property and equipment, net 242 306 Depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012 was $134,000 and $117,000, respectively.

The total valuation allowance increased $836,000 from December31, 2012 to December31, 2013. As of December31, 2013, we had federal and state net operating loss NOL carryforwards of approximately $557,934,000 and $88,224,000, subject to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code IRC limitations respectively, available to offset future regular and alternative minimum taxable income. The NOLs include deductions for stock based compensation for which a benefit would be recorded in additional paid-in capital when realized of $2,643,000 and $1,906,000 respectively.Our federal net operating loss carryforwards expire in various years from 2018 through 2033, if not used. The state net operating loss carryforwards expire in variousyears from 2014 to 2033, if not used. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was enacted on January 2, 2012.The Act reinstated the research and development credit retroactively to January 1, 2012.As the date of enactment was in 2013, we did not claim any federal tax benefit for the 2012 federal research and development credit until 2013.Due to the projected loss for the year with a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets, there is no tax impact for 2013. As of December 31, 2013, we had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $6,078,000 and $5,323,000, respectively, available to offset future tax liabilities.The federal tax credit carryforwards expire in the tax years from 2018 through 2033, if not utilized. The state research and development credits can be carried forward indefinitely. Federal and state tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss NOL and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for tax purposes, as defined in IRC Section 382. Based on a high-level ownership change analysis performed each year, management concluded that there were no ownership changes through December 2013. We follow the provision of ASC 740-10-25, Income Taxes: Recognition ASC 740-10-25. Our total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $2,777,000 and $2,273,000, respectively. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate were $160,000 and $163,000 as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December31, 2013 is as follows in thousands Balance at January 1, 2013 2,273 Additions based on tax provisions related to the current year 133 Additions fortax provisions of prior year 377 Settlements  Lapse of the statute of limitation 6 Balance at December 31, 2013 2,777 We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes. During the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012, we recognized approximately none and $7,000, respectively, for interest and penalties. We are subject to taxation in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our tax years 1998and forward remain open in several jurisdictions due to the NOL carryover from those tax years.  33 It is possible that the amount of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months.However, an estimate of the range of possible changes cannot be made at this time. Note 6 - Commitments and Contingencies Warranties and Indemnification We provide a warranty to our perpetual license customers that our software will perform substantially in accordance with the documentation we provide with the software, typically for a period of 90 days following receipt of the software. Historically, costs related to these warranties have been immaterial. Accordingly, we have not recorded any warranty liabilities as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our perpetual software license agreements typically provide for indemnification of customers for intellectual property infringement claims caused by use of a current release of our software consistent with the terms of the license agreement. The term of these indemnification clauses is generally perpetual. The potential future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification clauses is generally limited to the amount the customer paid for the software. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have been immaterial. We also maintain liability insurance that limits our exposure. As a result, we believe the potential liability of these indemnification clauses is minimal. We rarely have litigation initiated against us by customers.However, during the year ended 2010, we entered into a litigation settlement agreement with one customer that resulted in a non-cash credit redeemable for our products worth $300,000.We recorded this credit as an operating expense and liability during year 2010. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, any remaining unused credits shall expire after the second anniversary of the agreement. During year 2012, the credit expired, completely unused.Consequently, we reversed the $300,000 operating expense and extinguished the liability from our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2012. We entered into agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer is, or was, serving in such capacity. The term of the indemnification period is for so long as such officer or director is subject to an indemnifiable event by reason of the fact that such person was serving in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements may be unlimited; however, we have a director and officer insurance policy that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of our insurance policy coverage, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is insignificant. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. We assess the need for an indemnification reserve on a quarterly basis and there can be no guarantee that an indemnification reserve will not become necessary in the future. Leases We lease our headquarters facility and our other facilities under noncancelable operating lease agreements expiring through the year 2016. Under the terms of the agreements, we are required to pay property taxes, insurance and normal maintenance costs. A summary of total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating lease agreements is as follows in thousands Operating Leases Years ending December 31 2014 900 2015 376 2016 43 2017  2018 and thereafter  Total minimum lease payments 1,319 As of December 31, 2013 we do not have any estimated future facilities costs as a restructuring accrual. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2013, and 2012 was $1,304,000 and $1,246,000, respectively.  34 Legal Proceedings We are subject from time to time to various legal actions and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not presently a party to any material legal proceedings. Note7 Restructuring The facilities/excess assets accrual for each period includes future minimum lease payments, fees and expenses, net of estimated sublease income and planned Company occupancy, and related leasehold improvement amounts payable subsequent to the balance sheet date for which the provisions of ASC 420-10, as applicable, were satisfied. In determining estimated future sublease income, the following factors were considered, among others: current market conditions and rental rates, an assessment of the time period over which reasonable estimates could be made, the status of negotiations with potential subtenants, and the location of the respective facilities. As of December31, 2013, we no longer have any restructuring accruals or any future payments related to restructuring accrual.The net restructuring charge of $12,000 during year 2012 pertained to operating expenses paid in the period in excess of the initial estimated accrual for our vacant office space in Redwood City. The following table summarizes the activity related to the restructuring plans and accounted for in accordance with ASC 420-10 in thousands Amounts Accrued Charged to Accrued Restructuring Restructuring Amounts Restructuring Costs Costs and Paid or Costs Beginning Other Written Off Ending Year Ended December 31, 2012 Lease cancellations and commitments 450 12 462  Note8 Stockholders' Equity Convertible Preferred Stock As of December31, 2013, there were no outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock.Our Board of Directors and our stockholders have authorized 1,000,000 shares of convertible preferred stock that are available for issuance.

We granted 6,809 shares of restricted stock to the non-employee members of our Board of Directors in June 2013, and recorded a stock-based compensation expense of $65,000.We granted 5,798 shares of restricted stock to the non-employee members of our Board of Directors in 2012, and recorded a stock-based compensation expense of $50,000.The restricted stock will vest over a one-year period measured from the date of the annual meeting of stockholders with one quarter of the shares included in such Director Grant vesting on each of the dates that are three months, six months, nine months and twelve months from the annual meeting, so long as each board member continues to serve as a member of our board of directors on such vesting date. As of December 31, 2013, total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options was $2,394,000, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting periods of 164years. During the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we have received cash of $484,000 and $2,167,000, respectively from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases.

Note10 Related Party Transactions On November 14, 2008, BroadVision Delaware LLC, a Delaware limited liability company BVD, which was then our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with CHRM LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, that is controlled by Dr. Pehong Chen, our CEO and largest stockholder.We and CHRM LLC then entered into an Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of BroadVision Delaware LLC dated as of November 14, 2008 the BVD Operating Agreement. Under these agreements, CHRM LLC received, in exchange for the assignment of certain intellectual property rights, 20 Class B Shares of BVD, representing the right to receive 20% of any net profit from a capital transaction as such terms are defined in the BVD Operating Agreement of BroadVision Barbados Limited BVB, an entity wholly owned by BVD.A capital transaction under that agreement is any merger or sale of substantially all of the assets of BVB as a result of which the members of BVB will no longer have an interest in BVB or the assets of BVB will be distributed to its members. BVB is the sole owner of BroadVision On Demand, a Chinese entity BVOD.We have invested approximately $86million in BVOD directly and through BVD and BVB to date. In 2013, we executed a renewal contract with a third party of which Dr. Pehong Chen, our CEO and largest stockholder, is a board member.The total renewal license value associated with that contract is $156,000. In 2012, we executed a renewal contract with the same customer with an associated value of $152,000.

Note 12--Proceeds from Sale of Cost Method Investment In August 2010, a third party acquired a company in which we held an equity stake and distributed $13 million to us in connection with the closing of the acquisition.We had fully written off the investment to other expenses in 2002 due to an other-than-temporary decline in the fair market value at that time. Additional saleproceeds wereplaced in an escrow account for up to two years, subject to certain contingencies. In August 2012, we received an additional $08 million distribution from the escrow account, as a final distribution relating to this sale. We recorded these proceeds from this written off cost method investment as other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. Item 1. Business 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors 5 Item 2.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15f. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO 1992. Based on our evaluation, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013.  37 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation as of December 31, 2013 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2013 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act during the year ended December 31, 2013 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls As a result of being a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding our internal control over financial reporting. We have elected to not include such an attestation report in this annual report, which election was approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Item 1. Business 1 Item 1A.
