36  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tupperware Brands Corporation and all of its subsidiaries Tupperware, the Company. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. The results of operations of International Beauty are included from the date of acquisition on December5, 2005. The Companys fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of December. As a result, the 2005 fiscal year
contains 53 weeks as compared with 52 weeks for fiscal years 2004 and 2003. In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB, the Board issued FASB interpretation No. FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 was issued to provide guidance in determining if consolidation is required under existing standards or whether the variable
interest model under FIN 46 should be used to account for existing and new entities. A revised version, FIN 46R, was issued in December 2003. The revised standard is applicable to all special purpose entities SPEs created prior to
February1, 2003 at the end of the first interim or annual period after December15, 2003. It is applicable to all non-SPEs created prior to February1, 2003 at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending
after March15, 2004. The Company has adopted all components of this standard without material impact. Use of Estimates. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
In May 2005, the FASB issued FAS 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. This statement replaces APB No20,
Accounting Changes and FAS 3 Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. The statement requires retrospective application to
prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. This statement is effective for all accounting changes
and corrections of errors in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. The Company does not expect this statement to have an impact on its future financial results. Cash and Cash Equivalents. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents. As of December31, 2005 and December25, 2004, $790 million and $320 million, respectively, of the cash and cash equivalents included on the consolidated balance sheets were held in the form of time deposits, certificates of
deposit, high grade commercial paper, or similar instruments. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The Company maintains current and
long-term receivable amounts with most of its independent distributors and sales force in certain markets. The Company regularly monitors and assesses its risk of not collecting amounts owed to it by customers. This evaluation is based upon an
analysis of amounts currently and past due along with relevant history and facts particular to the customer. It is also based upon estimates of distributor business prospects, particularly related to the evaluation of the recoverability of long-term
amounts due. This evaluation is performed market by market and account by account based upon historical experience, market penetration levels, access to alternative channels and similar factors. It also considers collateral of the customer that
could be recovered to satisfy debts. The Company records its allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the results of this analysis. The analysis requires the Company to make significant estimates and as such, changes in facts and circumstances
could result in material changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Inventories. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
or market. Inventory cost includes cost of raw material, labor and overhead. Domestically produced Tupperware inventories, approximately 3 percent and 14 percent of consolidated inventories at December31, 2005 and December25, 2004,
respectively, are valued on 
37  Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
the last-in, first-out LIFO cost method. The first-in, first-out FIFO cost method is used for the remaining inventories. If inventories valued on the
LIFO method had been valued using the FIFO method, they would have been $49 million and $140 million higher at the end of 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company writes down its inventory for obsolescence or unmarketable items equal to the
difference between the cost of the inventory and estimated market value based upon expected future demand. The demand is estimated based upon the historical success of product lines as well as the projected success of promotional programs, new
product introductions and new markets or distribution channels. The Company prepares projections of demand on an item by item basis for all of its products. If inventory on hand exceeds projected demand, the excess inventory is written down to its
net realizable value. However, if actual demand is less than projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. In November
2004, the FASB issued FAS 151, Inventory Costsan amendment of ARB no. 43, Chapter 4. This statement amends the guidance in ARB No43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material spoilage. It was effective for fiscal years beginning after June15, 2004 and did not have a material impact on the Company. Internal Use Software Development Costs. The Company capitalizes internal use software development costs as they are incurred and amortizes such
costs over their estimated useful lives of three to five years beginning when the software is placed in service. In December 2005, the Company capitalized $13 million of software development costs as part of the assets recorded resulting from the
acquisition of International Beauty. This amount represents the fair market value of internal use software development costs at the acquisition date as determined by an internal analysis performed by the Company. The Company recorded these and all
other previously capitalized internal use software development costs in property, plant and equipment. Net unamortized costs included in property, plant and equipment were $161 million and $154 million at December31, 2005 and
December25, 2004, respectively. Amortization cost related to internal use software development costs totaled $50 million, $47 million and $42 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Property, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment is initially stated at cost. The Company recorded property, plant and equipment
arising from the acquisition of International Beauty at its fair market value as determined by the review of an independent third party with expertise in such valuation judgments. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis over the
following estimated useful lives of the assets:  Building and improvements

Molds
4 years
Production equipment
1020years
Distribution equipment
3 5 years
Computer/telecom equipment
3 5 years
Capitalized software
3 5 years
Depreciation expense was $441 million, $461 million and $484 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The Company considers the need for an impairment review when events occur that indicate that the book value of a long-lived asset may exceed its recoverable value. Impairments are discussed further in Note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements. Upon the sale or retirement of property, plant and equipment, a gain or loss is recognized equal to the difference between sales price and net book value. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense.
In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assetsan amendment of APB Opinion No29. The
amendments eliminate the exception to fair value accounting for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. Under APB 29,
accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar 
38  Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset is to be based upon the recorded amount of the asset relinquished
carryover basis with no gain or loss recognition.The transaction will now be accounted for based upon the fair value of the assets exchanged. The Statement is effective for exchanges occurring in fiscal years beginning after June15,
2005 and is to be applied prospectively.This statement has not had a material impact on the Company. Goodwill. Goodwill
represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. The Companys recorded goodwill was predominantly generated by its acquisitions of International Beauty in December 2005 and BeautiControl in October 2000. The Company
uses discounted future cash flow estimates to determine the fair market value of its acquired BeautiControl operations both in North America and overseas. The annual impairment review for BeautiControl was completed in the second quarter of 2005,
2004 and 2003 and no impairment charges were necessary. The goodwill recorded on the Companys balance sheet at December31, 2005 which is primarily included in the International Beauty and BeautiControl North America segments, was $2537
million and $390 million, respectively, with smaller amounts included in the Latin America and Asia Pacific segments. The valuation of Goodwill associated with the acquisition of International Beauty is subject to finalization of post-closing
adjustments in accordance with the Securities and Asset Purchase Agreement See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Other
Intangible Assets. Other intangible assets are recorded at their fair market values in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 141 Business Combinations and amortized over their estimated useful lives in accordance with SFAS 142
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The other intangible assets included in the Companys consolidated financial statements at December31, 2005 are primarily related to the Companys acquisition of International Beauty and
are recorded at their respective fair market values. The value of other intangible assets acquired with International Beauty and their weighted average estimated useful lives are as follows:  December31, 2005

of the five succeeding years is $241 million, $129 million, $88 million, $55 million and $40 million, respectively. Promotional
and Other Accruals. The Company frequently makes promotional offers to members of its independent sales force to encourage them to fulfill specific goals or targets for sales levels, party attendance, recruiting of new sales force members or
other business-critical functions. The awards offered are in the form of cash, product awards, special prizes or trips. A program is
generally designed to recognize sales force members for achieving a primary objective.An example is to reward the independent sales force for recruiting new sales force members.In this situation, the Company offers a prize to sales force
members that achieve a targeted number of recruits over a specified period.The period runs from a couple of weeks to several months.The prizes are generally graded in that meeting one level may result in receiving a piece of jewelry with
higher achievement resulting in more valuable prizes such as televisions and trips. Similar programs are designed to reward current sales force members who reach certain goals by promoting them to a higher level in the organization where their
earning opportunity would be expanded and they would take on additional responsibilities for recruiting new sales force members and 
39  Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
providing training and motivation to new and existing sales force members.Other business drivers such as the scheduling of new direct selling
demonstrations, increasing the number of sales force members holding parties or increasing end consumer attendance at parties may also be the focus of a program. The Company also offers cash awards for achieving targeted sales levels.These types of awards are generally based upon the sales achievement of at least a mid-level member of the sales force and their downline
members.The downline consists of those sales force members that have been recruited directly by a given sales force member, as well as those recruited by their recruits.In this manner, sales force members can build an extensive
organization over time if they are committed to recruiting and developing their units.In addition to the bonus, the positive performance of a unit may also entitle its leader to the use of a company-provided vehicle and in some cases, the
permanent awarding of a vehicle. Similar to the prize program noted earlier, car programs generally offer varying levels of vehicles that are dependent upon performance. The Company accrues for the costs of these awards during the period over which the sales force qualifies for the award and reports these costs primarily as delivery, sales and administrative expense. These accruals
require estimates as to the cost of the awards based upon estimates of achievement and actual cost to be incurred. During the qualification period, actual results are monitored and changes to the original estimates that are necessary are made when
known. Total promotional expenses included in delivery, sales and administrative expense were $2152 million, $1966 and $1961 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Like promotional accruals, other accruals are recorded at the time when the liability is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. Adjustments to
amounts previously accrued are made when changes in the facts and circumstances that generated the accrual occur. Revenue
Recognition. Revenue is recognized when goods are shipped to customers and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer who, in most cases, is one of the Companys independent distributors or a member of its independent
sales force. When revenue is recorded, estimates of returns are made and recorded as a reduction of revenue. Discounts earned based on promotional programs in place, volume of purchases or other factors are also estimated at the time of revenue
recognition and recorded as a reduction of that revenue. On December17, 2003, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission
SEC or the Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No104 SAB 104, Revenue Recognition, which superseded SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 104s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance in
SAB 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements, superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables which, was effective for revenue arrangements entered into in
fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2003. The Company has adopted the provisions of SAB 104 without impact. Shipping and
Handling Costs. The cost of products sold line item includes costs related to the purchase and manufacture of goods sold by the Company. Among these costs are inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, internal
transfer costs, and warehousing costs of raw material, work in process and packing materials. The warehousing and distribution costs of finished goods are included in the delivery, sales and administrative expense line item. Distribution costs are
comprised of outbound freight and associated labor costs. Fees billed to customers associated with the distribution of its products are classified as revenue. The shipping and handling costs included in delivery, sales and administrative expense in
2005, 2004 and 2003 were $615 million, $608 million and $659 million, respectively. Advertising and Research and Development
Costs. Advertising and research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Advertising expense totaled $89 million, $75 million and $55 million in 2005, 
40  Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
2004 and 2003, respectively. Research and development costs totaled $139 million, $130 million and $136 million, in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Research and development expenses primarily include salaries, contractor costs and facility costs. Both advertising and research and development costs are included in delivery, selling and administrative expenses. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. The Company has several stock-based employee and director compensation plans, which are described more
fully in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Through 2002, the Company accounted for those plans under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. Effective with fiscal 2003, the Company began accounting for those plans using the fair-value-based method of accounting for stock options under the provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, prospectively to all employee awards granted, modified, or settled after December28, 2002 as permitted under the transition guidance of SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and
Disclosurean amendment of FAS 123. Awards under the Companys plans vest over periods up to seven years. Compensation cost for options that vest on a graduated schedule is recorded over that time period. Therefore, the cost related to
the stock-based employee compensation included in the determination of net income for 2005, 2004 and 2003 is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair-value-based method had been applied to all awards since the original effective
date of SFAS 123. Compensation expense associated with restricted stock grants is equal to the market value of the shares on the date of grant and is recorded pro rata over the required holding period. Compensation expense associated with restricted
stock grants was $14 million, $06 million and $01 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123 had been
applied to stock-based compensation since its effective date.  In millions except per share amounts

model with the following assumptions: dividend yield of 42 percent for 2005, 51 percent for 2004 and 59 percent for 2003 grants; expected volatility of 31 percent for 2005 and 40 percent for 2004 and 2003; risk-free interest rates of 44 percent
for 2005, 39 percent for 2004 and 38 percent for 2003; and expected lives of 6 years for 2005 and 8 years for 2004 and 2003. On
December15, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued a revision of SFAS 123 entitled SFAS No123R, Share Based Payment. Under the revised standard the Company will be required to recognize compensation
expense on any unvested portion of grants not previously accounted for under the fair-value-based method. On March29, 2005, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No107 SAB 107,
Share-Based Payment. SAB 107 was issued to provide guidance on SFAS 123R and its interaction with certain SEC rules and regulations and to provide the SEC staff views 
41  Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
regarding valuation of share-based payment arrangements. On April14, 2005, the SEC adopted a new rule through release number 33-8568, Amendment to
Rule 4-01a of Regulation S-X regarding the Compliance Date for Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123 Revised 2004, Share-based Payment, to amend the effective date of SFAS 123R for registrants to fiscal years beginning
after December15, 2005. As such, the standard will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2006. Upon adoption of the final standard, the Company expects to incur approximately $10 million of incremental expense in each of 2006 and
2007 related to the unvested portion of stock options accounted for under APB 25 if all options vest based on the passage of time. However, certain of the outstanding options contain a provision that accelerates vesting upon achievement of stock
price appreciation targets. Achievement of these targets impact the timing and amount of incremental expense to be recognized. In 2005,
the SEC Staff offered its views on how companies should address non-substantive vesting conditions, such as retirement eligibility provisions, of share-based payment awards under FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and APB
25, Accounting for Stock Issue to Employees. Under FAS 123 and APB 25, it specifies that awards are vested when the employees retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service. The SEC clarified this
provision to specify that this would be the case for awards issued to employees who are or become retirement eligible during the vesting period when the award provides for accelerated vesting upon retirement. However, the prevalent accounting for
this situation has been to recognize the compensation cost over the nominal vesting period the vesting terms of the award. Companies that have been using this method were advised to continue doing so until adopting the provisions under FAS 123R.
Upon adoption of 123R, any new grants going forward are to be recognized as compensation immediately if issued to individuals who are already retirement eligible, or vest over the period of time the individuals will become retirement eligible if
it is prior to the nominal vesting period of the grant. The Company estimates the impact of using this vesting approach for its 2006 grants will be to accelerate recognition of approximately $15 million compensation expense in the initial year of
adoption. On August31, 2005, the FASB issued FSP 123R-1, Classification and Measurement of Freestanding Financial Instruments
Originally Issued in Exchange for Employee Services under FASB Statement No123R. The guidance defers the requirements of FAS 123R that a freestanding financial instrument originally subject to Statement 123R becomes subject to the
recognition and measurement requirements of other applicable accounting standards when the rights conveyed by the instrument to the holder are no longer dependent upon the holder being an employee of the Company. A freestanding financial instrument
originally issued as employee compensation would be subject to the recognition and measurement provisions of FAS 123R throughout the life of the instrument, unless its terms are modified after the time the rights conveyed by the instrument are no
longer dependent on the holder being an employee. This FSP supersedes guidance in FSP EITF 00-19-1, Application of EITF Issue No. 00-19 to Freestanding Financial Instruments Originally Issued as Employee Compensation which was issued on
May31, 2005. The FSP is effective in conjunction with FAS 123R which is the first quarter of 2006. There will be no impact to the Company upon implementation of the guidance in FSP 123R-1. On October18, 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 123R-2, Practical Accommodation to the Application of Grant Date as Defined in FASB Statement
No123R. Under FAS 123R, there is a requirement that a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of a share-based payment award has been communicated before a grant can be deemed to have been made. This FSP clarifies that a
mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of the award can be presumed on the date the award is approved if 1the award is a unilateral grant and the recipient does not have the ability to negotiate key terms and conditions of the
award and 2if the key terms and conditions are communicated to the individual recipients within a relatively short time period from the date of approval. The Company had no impact from the adoption of this standard. Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities. In fiscal 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No146, Accounting for Exit or Disposal
Activities, which addresses significant issues regarding the recognition, measurement and 
42  Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal costs under EITF 94-3, Accounting for Restructuring Charges. This standard impacts the
timing of recognition of any re-engineering or similar types of cost related to actions begun after adoption of this standard. Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. In March 2005 the FASB issued FIN 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which was issued to clarify the term conditional asset retirement
obligation as used in FASB No143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations issued in June 2001. FAS 143 refers to a companys legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of
settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity.The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of
settlement.Thus, the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event.Accordingly, a company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value
of the liability can be reasonably estimated.The fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred-generally upon acquisition, construction, or development and or through the normal
operation of the asset.Uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. In the fourth quarter
of 2005, the Company recognized a liability for the fair market value of conditional future obligations associated with environmental issues at its manufacturing facilities in Belgium and the United States that the Company will be required to remedy
at some future date should these assets be retired. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recognized $08 million of expense, net of $04 million of tax benefit, representing the cumulative effect of these conditional future obligations. The
Company will perform an annual evaluation of its obligations regarding this matter and will be required to record depreciation and costs associated with accretion of the obligation. This is not expected to be material. Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets also are recognized for credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted rates applicable to
taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and the credits are expected to be used. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. An assessment is made as to whether or not a valuation allowance is required to offset deferred tax assets. This assessment requires estimates as to future operating results as well as an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the Companys tax planning strategies. These estimates are made based upon the Companys business plans and growth strategies in each market. This assessment is made on an ongoing basis, and consequently, future material changes in the
valuation allowance are possible. Interest and penalties related to tax contingency or settlement items are recorded as a component of the
provision for income taxes on the Companys statement of income. The Company records accruals for tax contingencies as a component of accrued liabilities on its balance sheet.

Net Income Per Common Share. Basic per share information is calculated by dividing net income
by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted per share information is calculated by also considering the impact of potential common stock on both net income and the weighted average number of shares outstanding. The Companys
potential common stock consists of employee and director stock options and restricted stock. Restricted stock is excluded from the basic per share calculation and is included in the diluted per share calculation when doing so would not be
anti-dilutive. The common stock elements of the earnings per share computations are as follows in millions:  In millions

98 Derivative Financial Instruments. The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as
either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measures those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a
derivative accounted for as a hedge depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation of the hedge exposure. Depending on how the hedge is used and the designation, the gain or loss due to changes in fair value is reported
either in earnings or in other comprehensive income. Gains or losses that are reported in other comprehensive income eventually are recognized in earnings; with the timing of this recognition governed by SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 149, and SFAS 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities. The Company will on occasion enter into derivative agreements that it believes provide an economic benefit but do not qualify for hedge accounting under the preceding guidance. These derivatives are classified as speculative and all
fair value changes are immediately recorded as a component of net income. The Company uses derivative financial instruments, principally
over-the-counter forward exchange contracts and local currency options with major international financial institutions, to offset the effects of exchange rate changes on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, forecasted purchase
commitments and certain intercompany loan transactions. Gains and losses on instruments designated as hedges of net investments in a foreign subsidiary or intercompany transactions that are permanent in nature are accrued as exchange rates change,
and are recognized in shareholders equity, as foreign currency translation adjustments. Forward points and option costs associated with these net investment hedges are included in interest expense and other expense, respectively. Gains and
losses on contracts designated as hedges of intercompany transactions that are not permanent in nature are accrued as exchange rates change and are recognized in income. Gains and losses on contracts designated as hedges of identifiable foreign
currency firm commitments are deferred and included in the measurement of the related foreign currency transaction. Contracts hedging non-permanent intercompany transactions and identifiable foreign currency firm commitments are held to maturity.
The Company has also previously utilized interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of its fixed-rate U.S. dollar long-term debt to floating rate U.S. dollar debt. Changes in the fair value of the swaps resulting from changes in market
interest rates were recorded as a component of net income which offset the changes in the related long-term debt. As part of its financing of its acquisition discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has entered into
a floating rate term loan agreement and utilizes interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of this debt from floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt. These agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges of the forecasted interest
payments. Changes in the fair value of these swap agreements will be recorded as a 
44  Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
component of interest expense in connection with the interest payments under the term loan and are expected to be highly effective. See Note 7 to the
consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currency Translation. Results of operations of foreign subsidiaries are translated into
U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates during the year. The assets and liabilities of those subsidiaries, other than those of operations in highly inflationary countries, are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates at the balance
sheet date. The related translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses, as well as remeasurement of financial statements of subsidiaries in highly inflationary countries,
are included in income. Product Warranty. Tupperware brand products are guaranteed against chipping, cracking, breaking or peeling under normal non-commercial use of the
product. The cost of replacing defective products is not material. Reclassifications. Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified in the consolidated financial statements to conform to current year presentation. Note 2: Business Combination On December5, 2005, Tupperware acquired 100 percent of the net assets of the direct selling businesses of Sara Lee Corporation collectively
referred to as International Beauty. International Beauty sells a wide variety of consumable products, primary color cosmetics, skin care, fragrances and toiletries in about 20 countries in Latin America and Asia Pacific, Southern Africa and Europe
under the brand names House of Fuller, Nutrimetics, NaturCare, Avroy Schlain, Nuvo Cosmeticos and Swissgarde through a sales force of approximately 900,000 independent consultants. This acquisition was made to advance the strategy, begun with the
acquisition of BeautiControl in 2000, of adding consumable items to the product category mix by of expanding into beauty and personal care products. The results of operations for International Beauty are included in the Companys Consolidated
Statement of Income as of the date of acquisition. The acquisition cost was $556 million in cash subject to finalization of certain
adjustments in accordance with the Securities and Asset Purchase Agreement dated August10, 2005. The acquisition and the retirement of the Companys then existing $250 million in long term notes, was funded through cash on hand and a new
$775 million secured 7-year term loan which carries an interest rate of LIBOR plus 150 basis points. The total cost of the acquisition has been allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values in
accordance with SFAS 141, Business Combinations. Goodwill, none of which is deductible for tax purposes, and other intangibles recorded in connection with the acquisition totaled $2537 and $2630, respectively and are reported within the
International Beauty segment. The goodwill amounts recognized in the acquisition result primarily from the acquisition of the assembled workforce, including a management team with a proven track record of success in direct selling as well as, field
representatives in several significant markets. Of the $2630 of acquired intangible assets, $1974 million was assigned to registered trademarks, which were determined to have indefinite useful lives. Of the remaining balance of intangible assets
acquired, $620 million was assigned to sales force relationships and $36 million was assigned to product formulations which are being amortized over weighted average useful lives of 9 years and 3 year, respectively. Aggregate amortization expense
associated with the above intangibles recorded in 2005 subsequent to the acquisition date was $18 million and the estimated annual amortization expense for each of the five succeeding years is $241 million, $129 million, $88 million, $55
million and $40 million, respectively. 
45  Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
The Company is finalizing certain closing date adjustments with the seller as well as, the allocation
of income tax adjustments. Therefore the allocation of the purchase price and the valuation of the assets and liabilities are subject to refinement. The Company also anticipates an adjustment to the goodwill balance recorded at December31,
2005 as it executes re-engineering plans related to the elimination of duplicate functions. These adjustments are not expected to be material. The estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date are as
follows.  In millions

operations. In total, approximately 350 positions were eliminated primarily in the United States. The shift of manufacturing capacity from the Companys
facility in South Carolina which accounts for inventory using the LIFO basis of valuation to other manufacturing facilities which use the FIFO method of valuation resulted in a net reduction in the Companys LIFO reserve requirements of $56
million which is included as part of cost of products sold See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. The asset impairment costs of $65 million are primarily associated with write downs at the Companys United States facilities
including the write down of certain warehousing and distribution facilities and equipment at the Companys South Carolina facility and its former manufacturing facility in Halls, Tennessee. The current values are based on the assets fair
market value as determined by market appraisals performed at year end. In 2004 and 2003 the Company incurred severance costs related to
the reduction in headcount of approximately 220 and 170, respectively associated with actions to reduce the sales and marketing function in the U.S. business due to a change in the Companys sales force compensation plan, the rationalization of
manufacturing operations in the Philippines and Japan, and downsizing of operations in North America, Brazil, Korea, New Zealand and Mexico. Asset impairment costs incurred were primarily the result of write-downs of the book value of certain
machinery in the United States and Philippines manufacturing operations, the Companys former manufacturing facility in Halls, Tennessee and the net investment in the Companys operations in Argentina. Total impairment write-downs are
based on the excess of book value over the estimated fair market values of the assets impaired. Fair values were determined based on quoted market prices and discounted cash flows. Pretax costs incurred in connection with the re-engineering program included above and in other income statement captions by category were as follows:

In 2003, bad debt expense of $01 million related to re-engineering was included in delivery, sales and administrative expense. The balances, included in accrued liabilities, related to re-engineering and impairment charges as of December31, 2005,December25, 2004 and December27, 2003 were as follows:  In millions

The accrual adjustment in 2005 relates to the resolution of a litigation claim. The remaining accrual
at December 2005 relates primarily to costs of eliminating positions as a result of re-engineering actions taken in 2005 and is expected to be largely paid out by the end of the second quarter of 2006. In 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded adjustments to its beginning accrual balances of $08 million and $21 million, respectively, due primarily to
lower severance costs than originally estimated in the prior years. Note 4: Inventories  In millions

The average borrowings and weighted average interest rates were determined using month-end
borrowings and the interest rates applicable to them. The mortgage note is a 10-year note amortized over a 22-year period with monthly
payments of principal and interest of $47,988. The note is collateralized by certain real estate having a net book value of $67 million at December31, 2005. A principal payment of $44 million is due to be paid June1, 2009. 
The Company entered into a credit agreement on December5, 2005, in conjunction with closing its acquisition of International Beauty. The credit
agreement provided for $775 million of term loans and a $200 million revolving credit facility that expires December5, 2010 and replaced the Companys then existing revolving credit facility of the same amount. Proceeds from the term
loans were used, largely, to fund the acquisition of International Beauty, retire existing long-term notes and pay various acquisition fees and expenses. The Term Loan Facility is a floating rate debt instrument. Quarterly principal payments of $19
million each begin April2, 2006; however, the agreement permits the Company to omit these payments if certain prepayments have been made during the previous four quarters. The Company made such a principal prepayment in December 2005, in the
amount of $30 million and thus the first quarterly payment is now not due until April1, 2007. A final principal payment of $7004 million is due to be paid on December5, 2012. The debt is secured by substantially all of the
Companys domestic assets and capital stock of its domestic subsidiaries plus a 65 percent stock pledge of its significant foreign subsidiaries. 
49  Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
At December 31, 2005, the Company had $3100 million of unused lines of credit, including $192
million under the committed, secured $200 million revolving line of credit and $118 million available under various uncommitted lines around the world. The Company satisfies most of its short term financing needs utilizing its committed, secured
revolving line of credit. Interest paid on total debt in 2005, 2004, and 2003 was $489 million, $150 million and $158 million, respectively. The interest paid in 2005 includes make whole payments of $219 million relating to the early
prepayment of the 791% Notes due 2011. It also includes the pre-funding of $60 million of interest due under the terms of the 725% Notes that had been due in 2006. Both the 2011 and 2006 Notes were retired in connection with the acquisition of
International Beauty in December 2005. The new debt agreement contains covenants of a similar nature to those under the previous
agreement. While the new covenants are more restrictive than the previous covenants and could inhibit the Companys ability to pay dividends or buy back stock, the Company believes it will be able to continue paying its current $022 per share
quarterly dividend under the covenant requirements. The Company will provide detailed covenant calculations in its first quarter 2006 10-Q when the initial calculation is required under its credit agreement. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Due to their
short maturities or their insignificance, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and short-term borrowings approximated their fair values at December31, 2005 and
December25, 2004. The approximate fair value of the Companys term loan debt was $7450 million at December31, 2005 since the entire issue consists of floating rate debt. The approximate fair value of the $1000 million 725% notes
maturing in 2006, determined through reference to market yields, was $1047 million at December25, 2004. This debt was discharged in December 2005. The approximate fair value of the $1500 million 791% notes maturing in 2011, determined
through reference to market yields, was $1710 million at December25, 2004. This debt was retired in December 2005. Included in long-term debt at December25, 2004 was the $152 million fair value adjustment for changes in the fair value
of the $1500 million notes subsequent to the effective date of the interest rate swap agreements described below. The fair value of the remaining long-term debt approximated its book value at the end of 2005 and 2004.

currency exchange rates on the earnings, cash flows and financial position of its international operations. Although this currency risk is partially mitigated by the natural hedge arising from the Companys local manufacturing in many markets,
a strengthening U.S. dollar generally has a negative impact on the Company. In response to this fact, the Company uses financial instruments to hedge certain of its exposures and to manage the foreign exchange impact to its financial statements. At
its inception, a derivative financial instrument used for hedging is designated as either a fair value, cash flow or net equity hedge. Fair value hedges are entered into with financial instruments such as forward contracts with the objective of controlling exposure to certain foreign exchange risks primarily associated with accounts receivable, accounts 
51  Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
payable and non-permanent intercompany transactions. In assessing hedge effectiveness, the Company excludes forward points. In December 2005 and January
2006, the Company effectively converted $3750 million of its floating rate borrowings to fixed rate debt through interest rate swaps. The agreements call for the Company to receive a floating rate equal to the 3 month U.S. dollar LIBOR rate and pay
a weighted average fixed rate of 481%. The swap agreements expire in 2009 through 2012. These agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges with interest payments designed to match the interest payments due on the term loans due 2012. The
impact of these agreements will be recorded in interest expense. On July1, 2003, the Company entered into two swap agreements
effective September29, 2003 as a hedge of the fair value of its $150 million 791 percent debt due July 2011. Each swap agreement converted a portion of the borrowing from fixed to floating rate interest. The Company received premiums of
approximately $08 million for both agreements. Changes in the fair value of the swaps resulting from changes in market interest rates were recorded as a component of net income along with the offsetting changes in the fair value of the related debt
instrument to the extent that the hedge was effective. Ineffectiveness was insignificant in 2005, 2004 and 2003. The swap agreements both had original maturity dates of July15, 2011 and notional amounts of $75 million each. Under the terms of
the swaps, the Company received semi-annual interest payments coinciding with the interest payments on the underlying debt of 791% and paid a variable rate based on the 6 month LIBOR rate plus a spread of about 37 percentage points. The Company
entered two similar agreements during the second quarter of 2003 which the counterparties cancelled prior to becoming effective, and the $06 million premiums received by the Company were deemed to be ineffective and were recognized as other income
in that quarter. As part of its International Beauty acquisition, the Company terminated these swaps and generated a loss of $31 million which was originally deferred. Upon closing the acquisition and retirement of the debt, these deferred losses,
along with the remaining previously deferred gains totaling $08 million were recorded as a component of interest expense. Effective
July30, 2002, the Company terminated two interest rate swap agreements having notional amounts of $50 million and $75 million and generating gains of approximately $17 million and $33 million, respectively. These gains were capitalized as a
component of debt and were being recognized as a reduction of net interest expense. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company terminated a swap agreement having a notional amount of $75 million and generating a net gain of $54
million. This gain was capitalized as a component of debt and was being recognized as a reduction of net interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. This debt was retired in connection with the acquisition of International Beauty in
December 2005 and the deferred gains on the previously terminated swaps were recognized as a component of interest expense in 2005. The
fair value hedging relationships the Company has entered into have been highly effective and the ineffectiveness recognized in other expense for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003 was immaterial. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 67 billion Japanese yen that
matures on January24, 2007. The Company pays a fixed rate payment of 063 percent semi annually and receives a Japanese yen floating rate based on the LIBOR rate. This agreement converts the variable interest rate implicit in the
Companys rolling net equity hedges in Japan to a fixed rate. While the Company believes that this agreement provides a valuable economic hedge against rising interest rates in Japan, it does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under
SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Accordingly, changes in the market value of the swap are recorded as a component of interest expense as incurred. Over the life of the swap, any cumulative gains
or losses since the inception of the agreement will be reduced to zero. As of December31, 2005, the cumulative loss was approximately $04 million. A net gain loss of $04 million, $01 million and $03 million was recorded in net interest
expense for the years ended December31, 2005,December25, 2004 and December27, 2003, respectively. The Company also
uses derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures resulting from firm purchase commitments or anticipated transactions, and classifies these as cash flow hedges. The Company 
52  Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
generally enters into cash flow hedge contracts for periods ranging from three to twelve months. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging
instrument is recorded in other comprehensive loss, and is reclassified into earnings as the transactions being hedged are recorded. As such, the balance at the end of the year in other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings within
the next twelve months. The associated asset or liability on the open hedge is recorded in other current assets or accrued liabilities as applicable. Most of the balance at the end of 2003 was recorded as a component of cost of sales in 2004. In
2003, $158 million was recorded in foreign exchange loss as a component of other expense. As of December31, 2005,December25, 2004 and December27, 2003, the balance in other comprehensive loss was a $08 million, $05 million
and $07 million loss net of tax, respectively. The change in the balance in other comprehensive loss was a net loss gain of $03 million, $02 million and $42 million during the years ended December31, 2005,December25, 2004
and December27, 2003, respectively. The ineffective portion in other expense was immaterial. The Company had intended to refinance
its $100 million notes that were due in 2006. To protect itself from the risk of higher interest rates, in 2005, the Company entered into an agreement to lock in a fixed treasury rate of approximately 470 percent, as compared with a current market
rate of approximately 435 percent that was to provide the base interest for the debt originally expected to be issued in the refinancing. This derivative had been designated as a cash flow hedge and was recorded at its fair value on a quarterly
basis. Pending the expected issuance of the new debt, any gains or losses, to the extent they represented an effective hedge, were recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. In the third quarter 2005, in anticipation of its International
Beauty acquisition, when it was no longer probable that the refinancing of this debt would occur, the Company terminated these agreements and recorded a loss of $31 million as a component of interest expense. In addition to fair value and cash flow hedges, the Company uses financial instruments such as forward contracts and options to hedge a portion of its
net equity investment in international operations, and classifies these as net equity hedges. For the years 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded pretax net gains/losses associated with these hedges of $264 million, $236 million and
$110 million, respectively, in other comprehensive loss. Due to the permanent nature of the investments, the Company does not anticipate reclassifying any portion of this amount to the income statement in the next 12 months. The Companys derivative financial instruments at December31, 2005 and December25, 2004 consisted solely of the financial instruments
summarized above. All of the contracts, with the exception of the interest rate swaps, mature within 18 months. Related to the forward contracts, the buy amounts represent the U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to purchase foreign
currencies and the sell amounts represent the U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to sell foreign currencies, all translated at the year-end market exchange rates for the U.S. dollar. All forward contracts are hedging net investments
in certain foreign subsidiaries, cross-currency intercompany loans that are not permanent in nature as well as cross currency external payables and receivables, or forecast purchase commitments. The Companys theoretical credit risk for each derivative instrument is its replacement cost, but management believes that the risk of incurring
credit losses is remote and such losses, if any, would not be material. The Company also is exposed to market risk on its derivative instruments due to potential changes in foreign exchange rates; however, such market risk would be substantially
offset by changes in the valuation of the underlying items being hedged. For all outstanding derivative instruments, the net accrued loss was $02 million, $06 million and $44 at December31, 2005,December25, 2004 and
December27, 2003, respectively, and was recorded either in accrued liabilities or other assets depending upon the net position of the individual contracts. While certain of the Companys fair value hedges of non-permanent intercompany
loans mitigate its exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses, they result in an impact to operating cash flows as the hedges are settled. However, the cash flow impact of certain of these exposures is in turn offset by hedges of net equity and
other forward contracts. The notional amounts listed in the table above change based upon the Companys outstanding exposure to fair value fluctuations. 
53  Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
In January 2005, in order to hedge against the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar, the Company
entered into ten euro option agreements. Eight of the options were to hedge a portion of its net equity investments denominated in euros, and the other two were deemed speculative because they did not meet the requirements for hedge accounting. The
options strike prices were approximately 1256 U.S. dollars to the euro as compared with a market rate of 1326 U.S. dollars to the euro when the options were purchased. The effect of these options was to protect the value of the
Companys euro net equity and cash flows with a floor of 1256 U.S. dollars to the euro by giving the Company the option to sell euros at that value. The hedge options had an original combined notional value of 494million euro and
expiration dates at various points during 2005. The speculative options had an original combined notional value of 205million euro, with one of the options with a notional value of 63million euro having an expiration date of September
2005 and the other with a notional value of 142million euro having an expiration date of October 2005. When the exchange rate was above the strike price of the option immediately prior to their expiration, the Company allowed the option to
expire unexercised. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar was at a rate below 1256 U.S. dollars to the euro immediately prior to the expiration of the option contracts, they were exercised. At the end of each quarter, the Company revalued the open
options and recorded any change in fair value as a component of other comprehensive income for equity hedge options and as a component of other income or expense for the speculative options. For the year ended December31, 2005, the Company
exercised 6 options with an aggregate notional amount of 455million euros and allowed 4 with an aggregate notional amount of 244million euros to expire unexercised. The Company recorded a net pretax gain of $10 million associated with
the settlement of these options and had a pretax gain of $17 million associated with exercised hedge options that was recorded in equity. The Company entered into similar option agreements in 2004, all of which were accounted for as hedges, and all
of which expired unexercised during the year. The Company recorded a net pretax loss of $11 million and $17 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively for the cost of the options. Note 8: Investments In 2002, the Company began a program to hedge, for the following twelve months,
certain foreign cash flows generated in euro, Japanese yen, Korean won and Mexican peso. In this program, the Company utilized forward contracts coupled with high-grade U.S. dollar denominated securities. The securities purchased were classified as
available-for-sale with gains or losses on these securities recorded as a component of other comprehensive loss until maturity or sale, at which time any accumulated gains or losses were recorded as a component of net income. The forward contracts
were considered cash flow hedges as discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements and gains or losses were recorded as a component of other comprehensive income until the securities were sold. These investment securities had
maturities of less than three months and were recorded as a cash equivalent. At December31, 2005,December25, 2004 and December27, 2003, the Company had no such investments outstanding. During 2003, the Company sold
available-for-sale securities and generated $1055 million of proceeds and recorded in other expense realized losses of $161 million based upon specific identification. No such amounts were incurred in 2005 or 2004. As the cost of the program
increased, the Company determined that its cost exceeded its benefit and no new contracts for the other currencies were entered with maturities subsequent to December27, 2003. On September30, 2004, the FASB issued FSP 03-1-1 that delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance included in paragraphs
10 - 20 of Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue 03-1, Meaning of Other-than-temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments Disclosures required by paragraphs 21 and 22 of 03-1 are not deferred. The EITF is applicable
for debt and equity securities that are within the scope of FAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities and FAS 124 Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not-for-profit Organizations. It is
also applicable to equity securities that are not accounted for under FAS 115 and not accounted for under the equity method. The EITF provides a methodology for evaluating whether an impairment is other than temporary and would therefore require a
write down of the investment to clarify existing guidance. The Company does not maintain any investments to which 
54  Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
either the EITF or the FSP apply and as such neither has any immediate impact. Should the Company acquire such securities at a future date; the guidance
would be applicable and be considered in making impairment determinations. Note 9: Subscriptions Receivable In October 2000, a subsidiary of the Company adopted a Management Stock Purchase Plan the MSPP, which provided for eligible executives to purchase
Company stock using full recourse loans provided by the subsidiary. Under the MSPP, the Company loaned approximately $136 million to 33 senior executives to purchase 847,000 common shares from treasury stock. In 2001 and 2002, an additional nine
senior executives purchased 74,500 shares of common stock from treasury stock utilizing loans totaling $17 million. The loans have annual interest rates of 521 percent to 596 percent, and all dividends, while the loans are outstanding, are
applied toward interest due. Each of the loans has scheduled repayment dates of 25 percent on the fifth and sixth anniversaries of the loan issuance, with the balance due on the eighth anniversary. During 2005, eighteen participants surrendered
254,441 shares at current market prices to satisfy loans totaling $56 million. In addition, four participants made cash payments to satisfy loan payment obligations totaling $06 million. During 2004, two participants left the Company and sold, at
the current market price, 36,882 shares to the Company to satisfy loans totaling $07 million. Also during 2004, a participant left the Company and made a $07 million cash payment to satisfy the loan obligation and another participant elected to
make a voluntary advance loan payment of $06 million. During 2003, one participant left the Company and surrendered, at current market price, 30,100 shares to the Company to satisfy loans totaling $06 million with the balance of approximately $01
million satisfied with a cash payment from the participant. Under the terms of the MSPP, if the Companys stock price per share is below the market issue price at the scheduled principal repayment dates, the Company will make cash bonus
payments equal to the amount the value of the stock is below its purchase price, up to 25 percent of the outstanding principal on the loan then due. For each share purchased, an option on two shares was granted under the 2000 Incentive Plan. See
Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. The loans have been recorded as subscriptions receivable and are secured by the shares purchased. Principal amounts are due as follows: $13 million in 2006; $02 million in 2007; $34 million in
2008 and $04 million in 2009. No further loans or sales of stock are being made under this Plan. In 2005, the Company returned to income
$08 million of a provision recorded since the adoption of the MSPP for the potential cash bonus payments described above associated with principal amounts due in 2005. The potential bonus amount was forfeited based upon settlement of loan amounts
on dates other than scheduled repayment dates. The Company will continue to accrue for the cost of potential cash bonus payments due under to the terms of the MSPP for subsequent periods. On November30, 1998, the Company made a non-recourse, non-interest bearing loan of $77 million the loan to its chairman and chief executive
officer chairman, the proceeds of which were used by the chairman to buy in the open market 400,000 shares of the Companys common stock the shares at an average price of $1912 per share. The shares are pledged to secure the repayment of
the loan. The loan has been recorded as a subscription receivable and is due November12, 2006, with voluntary prepayments permitted commencing November12, 2002. Ten percent of any annual incentive plan cash bonus award to the chairman is
being applied against the balance of the loan. As the loan is reduced by voluntary payments after November12, 2002, the lien against the shares will be reduced. The subscription receivable is reduced as payments are received. In late 2000, the
loan and related agreements were assigned to a subsidiary of the Company. The outstanding loan balance was $73 and $74 million at December31, 2005 and December25, 2004, respectively.

These benefits were added directly to paid-in capital, and were not reflected in the provision for income taxes. Net deferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on the Companys balance sheet. Deferred tax liabilities assets are

at various dates from 2006 to 2025, while the remainder have unlimited lives. During 2005, the Company realized net cash benefits of $68 million related to foreign net operating loss carry forwards. At December31, 2005, the Company had
estimated foreign tax credit carry forwards of $366 million, most of which expire in 2013 and 2014 if not utilized. At December31, 2005 and December25, 2004, the Company had valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets
totaling $398 and $231 million, respectively. These valuation allowances relate to tax assets in jurisdictions where it is managements best estimate that there is not a greater than 50 percent probability that the benefit of the assets will
be realized in the associated tax returns. The likelihood of realizing the benefit of deferred tax assets is assessed on an ongoing basis. Consequently, future 
57  Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
material changes in the valuation allowance are possible. The Company received tax refunds paid income taxes, net, in 2005, 2004 and 2003 of $347, $458
million and $357 million, respectively. Included in the 2005 amount is a fourth quarter collection of $46 million related to a settlement of pre-June 1996 income taxes with the Companys former parent company, as well as a $10 million refund
from the United States Internal Revenue Service in settlement of audits for the period 1996 to 2001. The Company has foreign subsidiaries which receive tax holidays that will expire in 2007 if not renewed or extended. There are various factors which
may impact the amount of the annual benefit derived from the tax holiday. The net benefit of the tax holidays in 2005 was approximately $40 million. On December21, 2004, the FASB issued two FSPs which address issues related to recently enacted tax legislation. FSP 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, for the Tax
Deduction Provided to U.S.-Based Manufacturers by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, clarifies that the tax deduction for domestic manufacturers under the American Jobs Creation Act should be accounted for as a special deduction as opposed
to a rate reduction. The benefit of this provision is insignificant. FSP 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign
Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the special one-time dividends received deduction allowed by the act on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings
to a U.S. taxpayer. The Company elected not avail itself of this deduction. The Company has $3602 million of undistributed earnings of
international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes on these undistributed earnings because of its intention to permanently reinvest these earnings. Note 12: Retirement Benefit Plans Pension Plans. The Company has various defined benefit
pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees, except those employed by BeautiControl, and certain employees in other countries. In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides certain postretirement healthcare and life
insurance benefits for selected U.S. and Canadian employees. Most employees and retirees outside the United States are covered by government healthcare programs. Employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach normal retirement age
while working for the Company and satisfy certain years of service requirements. The medical plans are contributory for post-1994 retirees, with retiree contributions adjusted annually, and contain other cost-sharing features, such as deductibles
and coinsurance. The medical plans include an allowance for Medicare for post-65 retirees. In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act was signed into law. The Act provides new prescription
drug benefits under Medicare as well as providing for a federal subsidy to be paid to plans that are at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare in their prescription drug plans. In accordance with the provisions of FASB Staff Position FSP No. FAS
106-1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, the Company elected to defer including the impact of the act in its accumulated benefit obligation or net
periodic postretirement benefit cost during 2003. In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. This FSP provides
guidance on accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 by employers whose prescription drug benefits are actuarially equivalent to the drug benefit under Medicare Part D. It also contains
basic guidance on related income tax accounting and rules for transition allowing prospective or retroactive adoption and was effective for the third quarter of 2004. The Company has elected prospective adoption of the FSP guidance and has
remeasured the accumulated benefit obligation of its United States postretirement benefit plan as of July1, 2004. As part of the remeasurement, the assumptions were reviewed and the discount rate was changed from 60% to 625% in calculating
the obligation. The impact of the subsidy reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $77 million to $572 million at the remeasurement date. The effect of the subsidy on the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2004 was to
reduce the interest cost by $02 million and the amortization of the actuarial loss by $02 million. 
58  Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
On December23, 2003, the Board released a revised SFAS 132R, Employers Disclosure
about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. The additional disclosure required by the revised standard is included below. Disclosure related to estimated future benefit payments and disclosure of information about foreign plans was
effective for fiscal years ending after June15, 2004 and has also been included below. Effective June30, 2005, the Company
froze the benefits to participants under its U.S. defined benefit pension plans. This action necessitated a remeasurement of its accumulated benefit obligation under the plans and resulted in a pretax decrease of $51 million $33 million after
tax. As part of its remeasurement, the Company decreased its discount rate assumptions from 575 percent to 50 percent. Other assumptions remained consistent with those previously used. The Company also recorded an immaterial curtailment loss in
the second quarter of 2005 related to this action. In conjunction with the benefit freeze, the Company increased its basic contribution related to one of its domestic defined contribution plans from 30 percent of eligible employee compensation up
to the Social Security Wage Base to 50 percent. The Company uses a December measurement date for the majority of its plans. The plans of
International Beauty are included below as of December31, 2005. The funded status of all of the Companys plans was as follows:  U.S. plans Foreign plans Pension benefits Pension benefits Postretirementbenefits In millions

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans at December31, 2005
and December25, 2004 was $1279 million and $1067 million, respectively. At December31, 2005 and December25, 2004, the accumulated benefit obligations of certain pension plans exceeded those plans assets. For those plans,
the accumulated benefit obligations were $1073 million and $930 million, and the fair value of their assets were $425 million and $382 million as of December31, 2005 and December25, 2004, respectively. The accrued benefit cost for
the pension plans is reported in other liabilities. The costs associated with the International Beauty plans included below are as of the
acquisition date. The costs associated with all of the Companys plans were as follows:  Pension benefits Postretirement benefits In millions

The overall long-term rates of return on assets for the U.S. pension plans were chosen from the
range of likely results of compound average annual returns over a 20-year time horizon. The range was calculated by modeling a probable rate-of-return based on historical data for the period 1926-2002 for stocks, bonds and cash and was applied to
the Companys current target asset mix for the plan. The long-term rate-of-return for foreign pension plans was also selected from probable returns based on historical data as calculated by the actuaries as well as comparisons to trends in
other companies. The Company utilizes a published rating index of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments as a
benchmark for the discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations of its plans. For the U.S. plans, the discount rate was based on the rate of return for a portfolio of Moodys AA rated high quality bonds with maturities that are
consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plans. The weighted average discount rate for the U.S. and Foreign plans for fiscal 2005 were 55% and 50%, respectively and 58% and 45%, respectively for fiscal 2004.
The assumed healthcare cost trend rate for 2005 was 100 percent for both post-65 participants and pre-65 participants, decreasing to 50
percent in 2010. The healthcare cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. A one percentage point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects:  In millions

100 100 100 100 The Companys specific return objective on its U.S. pension plan is to achieve each year a
return greater than or equal to the return that would have been earned by a portfolio invested approximately 60 percent in equity securities and 40 percent in fixed income securities. The Company has adopted the following asset class allocations for
its U.S. pension plan: 62 percent in equity securities 32 percent large U.S. stocks, 20 percent small U.S. stocks, and 10 percent international stocks and 38 percent fixed income securities 37 percent bonds and 1 percent U.S. cash equivalents.
At each quarter end, the asset classes may be rebalanced to obtain the target asset mix if the percentages fall outside of acceptable range variances. The investment policy is reviewed from time to time to ensure consistency with the long-term
objective of funding at least 90 percent of the plans current liability. Options, derivatives, forwards, futures contracts, short positions, or margined positions may be held in reasonable amounts as deemed prudent. Transactions that would
jeopardize the tax-exempt status of the plan are not allowed. Lending of securities may be permitted in cases in which an appropriate gain can be realized. The Company does not invest in any of its own stock; however, this restriction does not
prevent investment in insurance company accounts, other commingled or mutual funds, or any index funds which may hold securities of the Company. Additional guidelines for investment managers selected by the Company to manage equity securities
prohibit the securities of one company or affiliated group, other than U.S. government securities, to exceed 10 percent of the portfolio and that no more than 20 percent of a separately managed portfolio be invested in any one industry, unless that
industry represents greater than 20 percent of the benchmark market index. International equity investments shall be diversified by country and by industry and primarily includes securities listed on significant exchanges. Equity portfolios may
include a small portion of convertible bonds and preferred stock but these securities do not substitute as bonds within the portfolios. Investment managers selected by the Company to manage the fixed income investments are also prohibited from
holding more than 10 percent in any one company or affiliated group of companies, other than U.S. government securities, and from holding more than 20 percent of investments in any one industry. In addition, no more than 20 percent of the fixed
income portfolio may be invested in foreign securities and no more than 20 percent of the portfolio may be invested in below investment grade securities. The Companys return objective for its foreign plans is to achieve a return generally in line with that which would be earned by a portfolio invested in the mix indicated in the table above. To achieve this
return, the foreign plans weighted average target allocations for its investments are 60 percent equity securities, 22 percent fixed income securities and 18 percent cash and money market investments. The Company expects to contribute $53 million to its U.S. and foreign pension plans and $47 million to its other U.S. postretirement benefit plan in
2006. The Company also has several savings, thrift and profit-sharing plans. Its contributions to these plans are in part based upon
various levels of employee participation. The total cost of these plans was $41 million in 2005, $23 million in 2004 and $46 million in 2003.

Incentive Plans the Incentive Plans. Annual performance awards and awards of options to purchase Tupperware shares and of restricted stock are made under the Incentive Plans. For the 2002 Incentive Plan, the total number of shares authorized for
grant was 2,850,000 of which 200,000 shares may be used for restricted stock awards. For the 2000 Incentive Plan, the total number of shares authorized for grant was 4,000,000 of which 200,000 shares may be used for restricted stock awards. For the
1996 Incentive Plan, the total number of shares authorized for grant was 7,600,000 of which 300,000 shares may be used for restricted stock awards. As of December31, 2005, shares available for grant under the Incentive Plans totaled 1,765,414,
of which 22,844 could be granted in the form of restricted stock. Other than the 157,118 options exchanged for certain BeautiControl
options in connection with the 2000 acquisition, all options exercise prices are equal to the underlying shares grant-date market values. Outstanding options granted in 2005, 2004 and 2003 vest in one-third increments on the anniversary
of the grant date in each of the following three years. Options granted under the MSPP vest seven years after the date of grant; however, vesting may be accelerated beginning three years after the grant date if certain stock appreciation goals are
attained. At December31, 2005, there are options to acquire 1,843,000 shares of the Companys common stock outstanding that were granted under the MSPP of which 535,718 are vested. The remainder of the options will vest on or before
November 2008. Outstanding restricted shares have initial vesting periods ranging from 1 to 3 years. All outstanding options have exercise periods that are 10 years from the date of grant. Outstanding restricted shares have initial vesting periods
ranging from 1 to 3 years. In September 2005, under the terms of the 2002 Incentive Plan, the Company issued a restricted stock grant for
100,000 shares of the Companys common stock to its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in connection with a retention program. The shares will vest on January1, 2011. The Company will recognize the fair market value of the grant as
compensation expense over its vesting period. The compensation expense associated with the grant was $01 million in 2005. Director
Plan. Under the Tupperware Brands Corporation Director Stock Plan Director Plan, non-employee directors are obligated to receive one-half of their annual retainers in the form of stock and may elect to receive the balance of their annual
retainers in the form of stock or cash. In addition, beginning in fiscal 2002 each non-employee director on the date of the Companys annual meeting of shareholders receives an automatic annual grant of a stock option. This option entitles the
director to purchase four thousand shares of the 
62  Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
Companys common stock at a price equal to the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of the grant in order to compensate the
directors at a competitive level with directors of comparable companies. This option may be exercised immediately and for a ten-year period from the date of grant. The number of shares authorized for grant under the Director Plan and the number of
shares available for grant as of December31, 2005, were 600,000 and 309,110, respectively. Earned cash performance awards of $93
million, $122 million and $76 million were included in the consolidated statement of income for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Stock

6,770,383 2010 Beginning with options granted in 2003, the Company has used the fair-value-based method of
accounting for stock-based compensation. The estimated weighted average fair value of 2005 grants was $544 per share under option. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for pro forma presentation had fair value estimates been used to
record compensation expense in the consolidated statements of income for the earlier years grants. Compensation expense associated with restricted stock grants is equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant and is
recognized ratably over the required holding period. Compensation expense associated with restricted stock grants was $14 million, $06 million and $01 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Note 14: Segment Information The Company
manufactures and distributes the following products primarily through independent direct sales consultants: 1food storage, preparation and serving containers, kitchen gadgets, microwave cookware and educational toys marketed under the
Tupperware brand worldwide, and organized into four geographic segments, 2premium cosmetics and skin care products marketed under the BeautiControl brand in North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific, and 3beauty and personal care
products mainly in Latin America and Asia Pacific under the brand names House of Fuller, Nutrimetics, NaturCare, Avroy Schlain and Nuvo Cosmeticos. Certain international operating segments have been aggregated based upon consistency of economic
substance, products, production process, class of customers and distribution method. International BeautiControl operations are reported in the applicable geographic segment. Worldwide sales of BeautiControl brand products totaled $1613 million 1289 million and $999 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. International Beauty operations are included from the date of acquisition.

65  Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued  a.
In 2002, the Company began to sell land held for development near its Orlando, Florida headquarters. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, pretax gains from these sales were $40 million 116 million and $37 million, respectively, and were recorded in other income in the table above. Internal costs for management incentives directly related to these sales were $01 million, $03 million and $02 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, and
were recorded in unallocated expenses. b.
The re-engineering and impairment charges line provides for severance and other exit costs. Total after-tax impact of these costs was $105 million, $43 million and $31 million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. c.
During 2004, the Company recorded a pretax gain of $15 million as a result of an insurance recovery from hurricane damage suffered at the Companys headquarters location in
Orlando, Florida. This gain is included in other income in the table above. Sales and segment profit in the preceding table
are from transactions with customers. Inter-segment transfers of inventory are accounted for at cost. Sales generated by product line are not captured in the financial statements and disclosure of the information is impractical. Sales to a single
customer did not exceed 10 percent of total sales in any segment. Export sales were insignificant. Sales to customers in Germany were $2310 million, $2526 million and $2337 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. There was no other foreign
country in which sales were material to the Companys total sales. Sales of Tupperware and BeautiControl products to customers in the United States were $2876 million, $2966 million and $3067 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Unallocated expenses are corporate expenses and other items not directly related to the operations of any particular segment. Corporate
assets consist of cash, buildings and assets maintained for general corporate purposes. As of the end of 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, long-lived assets in the United States were $1063, $981 million and $1068 million. As of December31, 2005 and December25, 2004 the Companys net investment in international operations was $8522 million and $835
million, respectively. The Company is subject to the usual economic risks associated with international operations; however, these risks are partially mitigated by the broad geographic dispersion of the Companys operations. Note 15: Commitments and Contingencies The Company
and certain subsidiaries are involved in litigation and various legal matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business. Included among these matters are environmental issues. The Company does not include estimated
future legal costs in any necessary accruals. The Company believes that it is remote that the Companys contingencies will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Kraft Foods, Inc., which was formerly affiliated with Premark International, Inc., the Companys former parent and Tupperware, has assumed any
liabilities arising out of certain divested or discontinued businesses. The liabilities assumed include matters alleging product liability, environmental liability and infringement of patents. As part of the International Beauty acquisition, Sara Lee Corporation indemnified the Company for any liabilities arising out of existing litigation at
the time of the acquisition and for certain legal matters arising out of circumstances which might relate to periods before or after the date of the acquisition. Operating leases. Rental expense for operating leases totaled $275 million in 2005, $289 million in 2004 and $321 million in 2003. Approximate minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases
in effect at December31, 2005, were: 2006$262 million; 2007$150 million; 2008$76 million; 2009$47million, 2010$34million and after 2010$29 million. Leases included in the minimum rental
commitments for 2005 and 2006 primarily relate to lease agreements for automobiles which generally have a 
66  Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
lease term of 2-3 years. It is common for lease agreements to contain various provisions for items such as step rent or other escalation clauses and lease
concessions which may offer a period of no rent payment. These types of items are considered by the Company and are recorded into expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease terms. The Company has a lease agreement on a warehouse located
in Europe which offers a purchase option of about $35 million, which is expected to approximate fair market value, at the end of the lease term in 2010. There were no material lease agreements containing renewal options. Certain leases require the
Company to pay property taxes, insurance and routine maintenance. Note 16: Quarterly Financial Summary Unaudited Following is a summary of the unaudited interim results of operations for each quarter in the years ended December31, 2005 and December25,

quarters, respectively of 2004. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Note 17: Rights Agreement In 1996, the Company adopted a shareholders rights plan with a duration of 10 years, under which shareholders received a right to purchase one
one-hundredth of a share of preferred stock for each right owned. The preferred shares are cumulative and are superior to common shares with regard to dividends. Each share is entitled to 100 votes on all matters submitted to the shareholders for a
vote. The rights are exercisable if 15 percent of the Companys common stock is acquired or threatened to be acquired, and the rights are redeemable by the Company if exercise rights have not been triggered. Under certain circumstances, if 50
percent or more of the Companys consolidated assets or earning power are sold, a right entitles the holder to buy shares of the Company equal in value to twice the exercise price of each right. Upon acquisition of the Company by a third party,
a holder could receive the right to purchase stock in the acquirer. The foregoing percentage thresholds may be reduced to not less than 10 percent. 
68  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Tupperware Brands Corporation: We have completed an integrated audit of Tupperware Brands Corporations 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits,
are presented below. Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index under a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Tupperware Brands Corporation at December31, 2005 and December25, 2004, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index under a2, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when
read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing in Item9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
69  
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As described in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, the direct
selling businesses of Sara Lee Corporation International Beauty because they were acquired in a purchase business combination during fiscal 2005. We have also excluded International Beauty from our audit of internal control over financial
reporting. International Beauty is a wholly-owned segment whose total assets, excluding goodwill and identifiable intangibles recognized as part of the acquisition, net sales and net income each represent less than 1 percent, approximately 3 percent
and less than 1 percent of the related consolidated financial statement amounts, respectively, as of and for the year ended December31, 2005. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Orlando, Florida March
15, 2006 
70  Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comment. None. Item 2. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Companys reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognized that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. As of the end of the period covered by this report, management, under the supervision of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of
the disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Companys management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Exchange Act Rule 13a-15f. As of the end of the period covered by this report, management, under the supervision of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. The Companys assessment of the internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2005, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. The Company has excluded the direct selling businesses of Sara Lee Corporation International Beauty from its assessment of internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 because they were acquired in a purchase business combination in December 2005. International Beauty is a wholly-owned segment whose total assets, excluding goodwill and identifiable intangibles
recognized as part of the acquisition, net sales and net income each represent approximately less than 1 percent, 3 percent and less than 1 percent of the related consolidated financial statement amounts, respectively as of and for the year ended
December31, 2005. Changes in Internal Controls There have been no significant changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the Companys fourth quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
affect its internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comment. None. Item 2. Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant The information as to the Directors of the Registrant set
forth under the sub-caption Board of Directors appearing under the caption Election of Directors in the Proxy Statement relating to the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May17, 2006, as well as the
information under the caption Corporate Governance in such proxy statement, and the information set forth under the caption Section 16A Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance in such proxy statement, is incorporated by
reference into this Report. The information as to the Executive Officers of the Registrant is included in Part I hereof under the caption Executive Officers of the Registrant in reliance upon General Instruction G to Form 10-K and
Instruction 3 to Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comment. None. Item 2. Executive Compensation The information set forth under the caption Compensation of Directors of the Proxy Statement relating to the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to
be held on May17, 2006, and the information in such Proxy Statement relating to executive officers compensation is incorporated by reference into this Report.
