The Board of Directors of Procom Technology, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Procom
Technology, Inc. and subsidiaries as of July 31, 2000 and 2001, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended July 31, 2001. In connection
with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited
the consolidated financial statement schedule as of and for each of the years in
the three-year period ended July 31, 2001. These consolidated financial
statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Procom Technology,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of July 31, 2000 and 2001, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended July 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
ORGANIZATION
Procom Technology, Inc. the Company was incorporated in California in
1987. The Company designs, manufactures and markets enterprise-wide data storage
and information access solutions that are compatible with all major hardware
platforms, network protocols and operating systems.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Procom
Technology, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The functional currencies of
the European subsidiaries are those of their respective countries. The Company
incurred foreign currency losses of approximately $29,000, $213,000 and $54,000
for the years ended July 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The Company did
not engage in hedging activities for any of these periods. The Company follows
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS 52 when
translating assets and liabilities and results of operations for each period
presented.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - CASH AND SHORT-TERM MARKETABLE DEBT
SECURITIES, HELD TO MATURITY
For statement of cash flow purposes, short term marketable securities with
original maturities less than 90 days are considered cash equivalents. The
carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value for all
periods presented due to the short-term maturities less than 90 days of these
financial instruments. At July 31, 2000, approximately $11,900,000 of the
short-term marketable securities were pledged as collateral for a repayment of a
loan which was repaid in fiscal 2001.
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, which defines derivatives,
requires that all derivatives be carried at fair value, and provides for hedge
accounting when certain conditions are met. This statement is effective for the
first fiscal quarter of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. Adoption of
this statement did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
The allowance for doubtful accounts represents management estimate of the
amount expected to be lost on specific accounts and on other as yet unidentified
accounts included in accounts receivable. In estimating the potential losses on
specific accounts, management relies on analyses prepared in-house and review of
other available information. The allowance for sales returns represents
management estimates of anticipated sales returns relating to each reporting
period. In estimating the allowance for sales returns, management relies on
historical experience. Although the Company believes it has the continued
ability to reasonably estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales
returns, the amounts the Company will ultimately incur could differ materially
in the near term from the amounts assumed in arriving at the allowance for
doubtful accounts and sales returns in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost on a first-in, first-out FIFO
basis or market. Allowances for obsolete inventory are based on management
estimate of the amount considered obsolete based on specific reviews of
inventory items. In estimating the                    41 allowance, management relies on its knowledge of the industry including
technological and design changes as well as its current inventory levels. The
amounts the Company will ultimately realize could differ materially in the near
term from amounts estimated by management.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using
the straight-line method over the respective estimated useful lives of the
assets, which range from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the lease term or
the estimated useful life of the assets.
Expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized, while minor
replacements, maintenance and repairs that do not extend the assets' lives are
charged to operations as incurred. Upon sale or disposition, the cost and
related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Company accounts and any
gain or loss is included in the statement of operations. Interest of
approximately $208,000, $489,000 and $142,000 has been capitalized during fiscal
years 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively, and included in the cost of the
Company headquarters.
Long-lived assets, goodwill and certain identifiable intangibles are
reviewed for impairment in value based upon undiscounted future operating cash
flows, and appropriate losses are recognized and reflected in current earnings,
to the extent the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value
determined by the use of appraisals, discounted cash flow analyses or comparable
fair values of similar assets.
INCOME TAXES
The Company reports certain expenses differently for financial and tax
reporting purposes and, accordingly, provides for the related deferred income
taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in
accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company generally records sales upon product shipment. In the case of
sales to most of the distributors with whom the Company has contracts, the
Company records sales when the distributor receives the products. The Company
recognizes product service and support revenues over the terms of their
respective contractual periods. The Company agreements with many of its VARs,
system integrators and distributors allow limited product returns, including
stock balancing, and price protection privileges. The Company maintains
reserves, which are adjusted at each financial reporting date, to state fairly
the anticipated returns, including stock balancing and price protection claims
relating to each reporting period. The Company calculates the reserves based on
historical rates of sales and returns, including price protection and stock
balancing claims, past experiences with its customers, the terms of its
agreements with its customers, and current information as to the level of
inventory held by the customer. The amounts the Company will ultimately realize
could differ materially in the near term from the amounts estimated. In
addition, under a product evaluation program established by the Company, its
indirect channel partners and end-users generally are able to purchase
appliances on a trial basis and return the appliances within a specified period,
generally 30-60 days, if they are not satisfied. The period may be extended if
the customer needs additional time to evaluate the product within the customer
particular operating environment. The value of the evaluation units are included
in inventory as finished goods. At July 31, 2000 and 2001, inventory related to
evaluation units was approximately $15 million and $22 million, respectively.
The Company does not record evaluation units as sales until notification of
acceptance for these units is received from the customer.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, as
amended, SAB 101 which was effective for us in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2001. Adoption of SAB101 did not have a material effect on the Company
consolidated financial position or results of operations.
DEFERRED SERVICE REVENUE
The Company markets and sells service contracts for certain of its
appliances that require the Company to service previously sold appliances for a
specified period of time, usually one to three years. Revenue from these
contracts is billed to customers at the time of sale, but earned ratably over
the life of the service agreement. A corresponding liability reflecting the
unearned revenue is recorded as a current liability, since unearned revenue
relating to service after 12 months is not material.                    42   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Costs and expenses that can be clearly identified as research and
development are charged to research and development expenses as incurred.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Three customers accounted for approximately 45% and 54% of the Company
total accounts receivable on July 31, 2000 and 2001, respectively, and one
customer accounted for approximately 9% and 7% of the Company net sales in
fiscal 1999 and 2000, respectively, while another customer accounted for 12% of
the Company net sales in fiscal 2001. The loss of any one of the Company
significant customers could have an adverse effect on the Company business.
NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE   Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net loss by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding during the period increased to include the
number of additional shares that would be outstanding if the dilutive potential
common shares had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and
warrants is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the
treasury-stock method.
Due to the net losses in fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001, no effect is given to
the potential dilution of outstanding stock options. Approximately 367,000,
1,184,000 and 922,000 shares would have been included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share if a net loss had not been incurred in fiscal 1999,
2000 and 2001.
Weighted average number of shares for basic and diluted net loss per share
are calculated as follows                              YEAR ENDED JULY 31,
1999      2000      2001

STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
The Company measures stock based compensation for option grants to employees
and members of the board of directors using a method which assumes that options
granted at market price at the date of grant have no intrinsic value. Proforma
net loss and net loss per share are presented in Note 10 as if the fair value
method had been applied.
Stock options issued to non-employees are recorded at the fair value of the
stock options at the performance commitment date.
IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and
SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS 141 requires that the
purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001 as well as all purchase method business combinations
completed after June 30, 2001. SFAS 141 also specifies criteria intangible
assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be
recognized and reported apart from goodwill, noting that any purchase price
allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately. SFAS
142 will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives no longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least
annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142. SFAS 142 will also
require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over
their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and
reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.
The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 141 immediately,
except with regard to business combinations initiated prior to July 1, 2001,
which it expects to account for using the pooling-of-interests method, and SFAS
142 is effective August 1, 2002.                    43 Furthermore, any goodwill and any intangible asset determined to have an
indefinite useful life that are acquired in a purchase business combination
completed after June 30, 2001 will not be amortized, but will continue to be
evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre-SFAS 142
accounting literature. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business
combinations completed before July 1, 2001 will continue to be amortized prior
to the adoption of SFAS 142.
SFAS 141 will require upon adoption of SFAS 142, that the Company evaluate
its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior
purchase business combination, and to make any necessary reclassifications in
order to conform with the new criteria in SFAS 141 for recognition apart from
goodwill. Upon adoption of SFAS 142, the Company will be required to reassess
the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in
purchase business combinations, and make any necessary amortization period
adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption. In addition,
to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful
life, the Company will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment
in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142 within the first interim period.
Any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized
as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first
interim period.
In connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation, SFAS 142
will require the Company to perform an assessment of whether there is an
indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption. To accomplish
this, the Company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying
value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including
the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units as of the
date of adoption. The Company will then have up to six months from the date of
adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to
the reporting unit carrying amount. To the extent a reporting unit carrying
amount exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit
goodwill may be impaired and the Company must perform the second step of the
transitional impairment test. In the second step, the Company must compare the
implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill, determined by allocating
the reporting unit fair value to all of it assets recognized and
unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation
in accordance with SFAS 141, to its carrying amount, both of which would be
measured as of the date of adoption. This second step is required to be
completed as soon as possible, but no later than the end of the year of
adoption. Any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle in the Company statement of
earnings.
And finally, any unamortized negative goodwill existing at the date SFAS 142
is adopted must be written off as the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle.
As of the date of adoption, the Company expects to have unamortized goodwill
in the amount of $1,140,000, and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in
the amount of $630,000, all of which will be subject to the transition
provisions of SFAS 141 and 142. Amortization expense related to goodwill was
$142,000, $167,000 and $340,000 for the years ended July 31, 1999, 2000 and
2001, respectively. Because of the extensive effort needed to comply with
adopting SFAS 141 and 142, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the
impact of adopting these statements on the Company financial statements at the
date of this report, including whether any transitional impairment losses will
be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle.
In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of, and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or
disposal of long-lived assets. This statement is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001. Adoption of this statement will not have a
material impact on the Company consolidated financial position or results of
operations.                    44 2. INVENTORIES

has recorded a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax assets as it is
more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of the
existing net deferred tax asset at July 31, 2000. The Company claimed no benefit
in the current provision for some $3,518,000 in operating losses at its foreign
subsidiaries. If those subsidiaries generate taxable income in future periods,
the Company may realize a tax benefit for these operating losses.
At July 31, 2001, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for
federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $6,626,000 and
$11,862,000, respectively, which are available to offset future taxable income,
if any, through 2021 and 2015, respectively. Utilization of the net operating
loss carryforwards may be limited under Internal Revenue Code Section 382.
At July 31, 2001, the Company had tax credit carryforwards for federal and
state income tax purpose of approximately $887,000 and $672,000, respectively.
The federal and state carryforwards are available to offset future tax
liability, if any, through 2021. Utilization of the credit carryforwards may be
limited under Internal Revenue Code Section 382.                    46 5. OTHER ASSETS

Goodwill relates to two acquisitions completed by the Company in fiscal
1998, two acquisitions completed in fiscal 1999 and one acquisition completed in
fiscal 2001. Goodwill is amortized on a straight line basis over four to seven
years. In fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001, amortization of goodwill was $142,000 167,000 and $340,000, respectively.
6. LINES OF CREDIT AND CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE
On July 31, 2000, the Company had established a revolving line of credit
with Finova Capital Corporation. The line had been based on a percentage of the
Company eligible accounts receivable and inventory, up to a maximum of
$10,000,000. In early October 2000, the Company paid off all amounts outstanding
under the Finova line of credit and replaced it with the line of credit with CIT
Business Credit.
On October 10, 2000, the Company entered into a term loan agreement and a
three-year working capital line of credit with CIT Business Credit. A term loan
of $40 million, due and payable upon the Company finalization of a long-term
mortgage on its corporate headquarters or paid in 12 monthly installments
commencing April 1, 2001, was repaid in May 2001. An initial term loan of $10
million, due and payable in 90 days, was repaid on November 1, 2000. The term
loans under the agreement incurred interest at the lender prime rate 675%
per annum at July 31, 2001, plus 5%, with increases if the loan was not
reduced according to a fixed amortization. The working capital line of credit
allows for the Company to borrow, on a revolving basis, for a period of three
years, a specified percentage of its eligible accounts receivable and
inventories approximately $29 million at July 31, 2001, up to a limit of $50
million. Amounts outstanding under the working capital line bear interest at the
lender prime rate plus 25%. At July 31, 2001, no amounts were outstanding
under the various credit arrangements. The lender charged approximately $130,000
for the credit facility which is being amortized as interest expense over the
term of the credit agreement. The line of credit accrues various monthly
maintenance, minimum usage and early termination fees. The line of credit
requires certain financial and other covenants, including the maintenance of a
minimum EBITDA requirement for each fiscal quarter beginning in the quarter
ended January 31, 2001. At July 31, 2001, the Company was not in compliance with
the minimum EBITDA requirement. Although the Company has repaid all amounts
outstanding under the credit facility and does not intend to borrow against the
line of credit in fiscal 2002, CIT may elect to decline making any advances
under the line of credit or may terminate the line. In addition, if advances are
made while the Company is out of compliance with the financial or other
covenants, CIT may charge the Company the default rate of interest currently
90% per annum on those advances. The Company has initiated discussions with
various other potential financing sources regarding an alternate short-term
working capital financing arrangement. However, no assurance can be given that
the Company will be successful in obtaining any such financing arrangement on
favorable or any terms. The line of credit is collateralized by all of the
assets of the Company.
In addition to the CIT line of credit noted above, the Company replaced the
Finova flooring line of credit with a flooring line with IBM Credit who has
committed to make $25 million in flooring inventory commitments available to
the Company. As of July 31, 2001, the Company owed $531,000 under the flooring
line. The flooring line is collateralized by the specific inventory purchased
pursuant to the flooring commitments. CIT and IBM Credit have entered into an
intercreditor agreement which determines the level of priority of either
lender security interest. As of July 31, 2001, the Company owed $531,000 under
the flooring line. The flooring line requires the maintenance by the Company of
a minimum net worth of $160 million. The flooring line also requires the
Company to represent, at the time we request advances under the line, that the
Company is in compliance with the terms of the Company other loan agreements.
Because of the Company default of the financial covenant of the CIT credit
line, the Company was out of compliance with this portion of the flooring line
at July 31, 2001. Although the Company has no borrowings under the CIT credit
line, the Company has advised IBM of the CIT default, and has requested that IBM
not declare a default under IBM credit line in respect of the CIT covenant
default under the CIT credit line. If IBM were to declare a default under the
flooring line, IBM could decline to make further advances under this line and/or
terminate the line.   On October 31, 2000, the Company issued a $150 million convertible
unsecured debenture to a private investor. The debenture bears interest at 60%
per annum, and is repayable in full on October 31, 2003, unless otherwise
converted into the common stock of the Company. The debenture is convertible
into the common stock of the Company at the investor option at an initial
conversion price of $2279 per share, subject to antidilution adjustments, and
at the Company option, if the common stock of the Company trades at more than
135% of the conversion then in effect for at least 20 consecutive trading days.
The conversion price can be adjusted if the Company sells shares of its common
stock at a price less than $2279 per share while the debentures are
outstanding.                    47 The conversion price under the debenture automatically re-sets periodically.
During these re-set periods, the conversion price will, for five consecutive
trading days, adjust to 90% of the average closing price of the Company stock
during the 10 trading days preceding each re-set period if this amount is less
than the conversion price that would otherwise apply. The first re-set period
began on May 15, 2001 and ended May 21, 2001. The next re-set period begins on
October 31, 2001 and additional re-set periods will occur every six months
thereafter. During the first re-set period, the investor elected to convert $50
million of the debenture at a re-set conversion price of approximately $971 per
share. The Company had the option and elected to pay the investor in cash the
$50 million principal amount of the debenture that the investor elected to
convert during the first re-set period. Up to an additional $50 million of the
debentures, plus any unpaid interest on that amount, may be converted at the
re-set conversion price beginning on October 31, 2001, and any remaining portion
of the debenture, plus any unpaid interest, may be converted at the re-set
conversion price during any subsequent re-set period. The Company has the right
to pay the investor in cash the principal amount of any portion of the debenture
the investor elects to convert during a re-set period. If the Company were to
issue shares at 90% of the trading price of its common stock upon conversion of
the debenture during a re-set period, the Company would incur a charge to its
statements of operations, which could be significant, based on the difference
between the issuance price of the Company common stock and the value of the
common stock at October 31, 2000. In connection with the issuance of the
debenture, the Company issued to the investor a 5-year warrant to purchase up to
32,916 shares of its common stock at an initial exercise price of $3255 per
share, with the number of shares for which the warrant is exercisable and the
exercise price subject to antidilution adjustments. The Company has valued the
warrant using the Black-Scholes model, with the following assumptions: Expected
life -- 5 years, Risk free interest rate -- 6%, and Volatility -- 120. These
factors yield a value of $562,000, which will be amortized through May 2002, the
last re-set period.
The principal amount of the debenture, net of the remaining unamortized
warrant value is classified as a current liability. At July 31, 2001, the
debenture amount repayable was $10,000,000 and the unamortized warrant value was
$274,000, for a net debenture value of $9,726,000 and is classified as a current
liability. In addition to the warrant cost, approximately $700,000 of debt
issuance costs were incurred in the debt transactions noted above. The
unamortized cost of approximately $529,000 is included in prepaid expenses and
will be amortized as interest expense through May 2002, the last re-set period.
At July 31, 2001, the Company is in default under the financial covenant of the
CIT loan agreement. The investor has advised the Company informally that it will
not declare an event of default under the debenture as long as there is no
amount outstanding under the CIT loan agreement.
In June 2001, the Company completed the sale of 3,800,000 shares of common
stock raising gross proceeds of approximately $342 million before offering
costs of $27 million. The Company intends to use up to $100 million of the
offering proceeds in the future to pay any remaining indebtedness under the
debenture. As a result of this offering, the conversion price of the outstanding
debenture was adjusted to $1957 pursuant to a weighted average adjustment under
the terms of the debenture. In addition, the completion of the offering resulted
in an adjustment to the exercise price of the warrant and to the number of our
shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant pursuant to anti-dilution
provisions of the warrant. As so adjusted, the warrant exercise price is $2795
and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant is 38,333.
In addition to the line of credit, our foreign subsidiaries in Germany,
Italy and Switzerland have lines of credit with banks in their respective
countries that are utilized primarily for overdraft and short-term cash needs.
At July 31, 2001, approximately $8,000 was outstanding under these lines.
In October 2000, the Company repaid the 18 month loan payable to an
investment bank of $1075 million. The loan, which originally matured in
September 2000 but was subsequently renewed for an additional 6 month period,
carried rates ranging from 6125% to 74%. At July 31, 2000, approximately $119
million of the Company commercial paper portfolio was pledged as collateral
for repayment of this loan.
7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
LEASE COMMITMENTS
At July 31, 2001, the Company leases facilities under non-cancelable
operating leases in Munich, Germany; Milan and Rome, Italy; Ontario, Canada;
Paris, France and Livingston, Scotland, Great Britain. In addition, the Company
has various operating leases for certain office equipment and vehicles.                    48   At July 31, 2001, future minimum lease payments under these leases were as
follows                  OPERATING

Total minimum lease payments   $1,003,000
Rent expense was $1,439,000, $1,412,000 and $458,000 for fiscal 1999, 2000
and 2001, respectively.
FLOORING AGREEMENTS
As is customary in the computer reseller industry, the Company is
contingently liable at July 31, 2001 under the terms of repurchase agreements
with several financial institutions providing inventory financing for dealers of
the Company appliances. Under these agreements, dealers purchase the Company
appliances, and the financial institutions agree to pay the Company for those
purchases, less a pre-set financing charge, within an agreed payment term. Two
of these institutions, Finova and IBM Credit Corporation, have also provided the
Company with vendor inventory financing. The contingent liability under these
agreements approximates the amount financed, reduced by the resale value of any
appliances that may be repurchased. The risk of loss is spread over several
dealers and financial institutions. At July 31, 2000 and 2001, the Company was
contingently liable for purchases made under these agreements of approximately
$560,000 and $62,000, respectively. During the three years ended July 31, 2001,
the Company was not required to repurchase any previously sold inventory
pursuant to the flooring agreements.
LITIGATION
The Company is involved in routine litigation arising in the ordinary course
of its business. While the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with
certainty, the Company believes that none of the pending litigation will have a
material adverse effect on the Company financial position or results of
operations.
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS
The Company has employment agreements with the Company President and three
Executive Vice Presidents. Each agreement is for a three-year term with an
automatic renewal provision which provides that the agreement will perpetually
maintain a three-year term unless terminated. Each agreement contains severance
provisions that require the payment of 35 months of base salary in the event of
the termination of the covered executives. Should all four executives be
terminated, the aggregate commitment arising under the severance provisions
would be approximately $26 million and, in addition, the Company would be
obligated to pay a pro rata bonus for the year of termination and to continue
for up to two years all life insurance and medical benefits.
8. RETIREMENT PLAN
The Company has a defined contribution plan covering substantially all
full-time employees with more than one year of service. Each participant can
elect to contribute up to 15% of his or her annual compensation. While employer
contributions to the plan are discretionary, during fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001
the Company elected to make matching contributions equivalent to between 38% and
50% of the first 4% of each eligible employee contribution. Total expense for
fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001 was $106,000, $86,000 and $82,000, respectively.
9. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
During the three years ended July 31, 2001, the Company utilized the
services of Advanced Construction Solutions, Inc. ACS, an Orange County based
real estate developer and general contractor to a locate a suitable facility
for the Company to utilize as its corporate headquarters for approximately 18
months, b act as a general contractor to complete a build-out of necessary
tenant improvements for the temporary facility, and c locate, and then
negotiate the purchase of, and commence development of, a parcel of land in
Irvine, California for the Company long-term corporate headquarters. ACS is
owned 50% by a brother of Frank Alaghband                    49 an Executive Vice President and Director of the Company. During the year ended
July 31, 1999, the Company executed an 18 month lease with an unrelated
landlord, calling for approximately $1,050,000 in lease payments, and the
Company purchased an 8 acre site from an unrelated landowner for approximately
$73 million. ACS received approximately $357,000 directly from the Company for
the tenant improvement build-out of approximately 60,000 square feet, $40,200
directly from the Company for services in planning and developing the Irvine
facility, and approximately $142,000 in commissions paid by the temporary
facility landlord and the land owner upon the completion of the transactions
described. The Company had also agreed to utilize ACS in the construction of the
Irvine facility. The Company has expended approximately $77 million for
construction costs through July 31, 2001. A majority of the construction costs
were paid to ACS.
10. STOCK OPTION PLAN AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN   During fiscal 1996, the Company instituted the 1995 Stock Option Plan the
1995 Plan for its key employees and reserved 540,000 shares for grant under
the 1995 Plan. Subsequently, the Board and the Company shareholders approved
the reservation of an additional 3,050,000 shares for grant under the 1995 Plan.
Pursuant to the terms of the 1995 Plan, options to purchase the Company common
stock may be granted with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the
stock on the date of grant. Options expire ten years from the date of the grant
and generally vest over a period of four years. In September 1998, the Board
authorized the re-pricing of 374,950 options previously granted with exercise
prices in excess of $450 per share. The new exercise price was $450 per share,
the fair value of the Company stock on the date of such re-pricing. Repriced
options are included in the granted and cancelled amounts below.

During the years ended July 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, the Company recognized
tax benefits of $71,000, $0 and $0, respectively, from the gains resulting from
exercises by employees of non-qualified stock options. The tax benefit is
recorded as an increase to additional paid-in-capital.
Pro forma information regarding net loss and net loss per share is required
by SFAS 123 as if the Company had accounted for its stock options under the fair
value method of SFAS 123. The fair value of the Company stock options was
estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes
option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
In addition, the Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including the expected stock volatility. Because the Company
stock options granted to employees have characteristics significantly different
from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its stock options granted to employees. The fair
value of the Company stock options granted to employees was estimated assuming
no expected dividends and the following weighted average assumptions                STOCK OPTION PLAN SHARES

that operates in accordance with Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code
whereby eligible employees may, subject to certain limitations, authorize
payroll deductions of up to 10% of their salary to purchase shares of the
Company common stock at 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the first
or last date of semiannual purchase periods, whichever is less. The Company has
reserved 250,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP.
Approximately 6,000, 26,000 and 25,000 shares were issued under the ESPP during
fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.
11. REVENUE BY PRODUCT AREA AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA
REVENUES BY PRODUCT FAMILIES
The Company operates in one principal industry segment: the design,
manufacture and marketing of enterprise-wide data storage and information access
solutions compatible with all major hardware platforms, networks and operating
systems. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company net sales
in fiscal 1999 or 2000. In fiscal 2001, one customer accounted for approximately
12% of the Company net sales.                            YEAR ENDED JULY 31,

International sales were primarily to European customers. As a result of the
Company February 1998 acquisition of the outstanding stock of Megabyte, and
the subsequent acquisitions of Procom Technology, AG, Procom Technology, SPA and
Scofima, the Company had identifiable assets used in connection with its foreign
operations of approximately $7,054,000, $7,565,000 and $8,447,000 at July 31,
1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.                    51 12. ACQUISITIONS
On December 28, 2000, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Scofima Software S.r.l., a company organized under the laws of
Italy Scofima, in exchange for 480,000 shares of the Company common stock.
Pursuant to its agreement with the former shareholders of Scofima, the Company
registered for resale by those shareholders the shares issued to them in the
acquisition. Scofima had an option to acquire a software system designed as a
caching and content distribution solution. Immediately prior to the Company
acquisition of Scofima, Scofima exercised its option, and acquired the software
system. The purpose of the software is to provide functionalities that are
necessary for the content delivery market of the internet. The software had been
in development for approximately 2-3 years, involving 5 programmers and system
developers. The software was not complete at the date of acquisition, and was
not yet determined to be technologically feasible. The Company is currently
completing the software, and expects to release it in the third quarter of
fiscal 2002. The Company issued 480,000 shares valued at $12 per share and
incurred approximately $250,000 in acquisition costs in exchange for the
outstanding shares of Scofima. Scofima had net assets of approximately $500,000
at the date of acquisition. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase of
assets. The Company employed an appraiser to identify the values of the assets
acquired, including, among other assets, certain in-process research and
development costs. The amount of purchase price allocated to in-process research
and development was determined by estimating the stage of development of the
software, estimating future cash flows from projected revenues, and discounting
those cash flows to present value. The discount rate applied was 25%. The
incremental product sales resulting from the products incorporating the software
are estimated to be $44 million over the initial four years of sales with sales
growing from approximately $15 million in the initial year to $134 million in
the fourth year. The appraiser concluded, and the Company has determined that
approximately $43 million of the purchase price was related to the Company
research and development efforts that had not attained technological feasibility
and for which no future alternative use was expected. The Company has expensed
the value of the research and development as of the date of the acquisition of
Scofima and capitalized the fair value of the other assets acquired as
determined and allocated by the appraiser, including the value of the assembled
workforce of approximately $02 million and developer relationships valued at
$01 million which will be amortized over 4 years, with the remainder of $14
million assigned to goodwill, which will amortized over 4 years. The following
is a summary of the net fair value of the assets acquired, the liabilities
assumed, and the total consideration paid for Scofima                       
Net fair value of assets acquired..  $ 6,120,000

Net loss per share - basic and diluted     $ 071      $ 120   During fiscal 1999, the Company completed the acquisitions of Procom
Technology, AG and Procom Technology, SPA. In November 1998, the Company
acquired all of the outstanding stock of Procom Technology, AG in exchange for
28,500 shares of stock and $22,000 in cash. Procom Technology, AG is a
relatively small Swiss distributor of computer storage peripherals, and has been
a customer of the Company for more than five years. The Company treated the
acquisition of Procom Technology, AG as a purchase, and recorded goodwill of
approximately $168,000, which is being amortized over seven years.
In January 1999, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Procom
Technology, SPA in exchange for 51,100 shares of stock and $50,000 in cash.
Procom Technology, SPA is a relatively small Italian distributor of higher end
computer storage peripherals. The Company acquisition of Procom Technology,
SPA, which was initially treated as a pooling-of-interests, has been changed to
reflect the purchase accounting method. As a result of this change, revenue and
net income for the second quarter of fiscal 1999 were reduced by approximately
$31 million and $01 million, respectively, from that which was initially
reported. The Company recorded goodwill of approximately $286,000, which is
being amortized over seven years.                    52   The following is a summary of the net fair value of the assets acquired, the

As a result of changes to the Company business operations, as well as
significant operating losses of Invincible Technologies Corporation after its
acquisition, in fiscal 1999, the Company determined it should restructure the
operating activities of Invincible. At the time of acquisition, the Company
sought to utilize Invincible sales force to market and sell products of both
Invincible and Procom Netforce products. During the year after the
acquisition, Invincible experienced significant margin pressure on its products
and was unable to increase the sales of Netforce products. From the date of
acquisition through April 1999, the Company had experienced significant
financial losses from its Invincible operations. The restructuring consisted of
closing several field offices, eliminating most of the Invincible product lines
and reducing staff significantly. In connection with the restructuring, the
Company also reviewed the long-lived assets purchased in the Invincible
acquisition. After comparing the carrying value of the assets to the estimated
future undiscounted cash flows from the assets, the Company determined that the
value of the assets were impaired. The Company wrote off the goodwill remaining
from the transaction of approximately $08 million, and wrote down the carrying
value of certain Invincible fixed assets by $06 million. In addition, the
Company recorded a restructuring charge comprised of approximately $02 million
for lease termination and employee severance costs for approximately 10
employees relating to the Invincible operations. Approximately $02 million of
the restructuring charge was accrued as of July 31, 1999 and was paid during
fiscal 2000. In addition, the Company recorded, in cost of sales, additional
reserves of approximately $08 million to reserve for the ultimate disposal of
much of the Invincible inventory. As a result of the restructuring, the Company
expects to see lower personnel costs and lower fixed charges such as
depreciation relating to Invincible operations in the future.
