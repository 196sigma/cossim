AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSYears ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010Note1.Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesDescription of Business.RealNetworks, Inc. and subsidiaries is a leading global provider of network-delivered digital media applications and services that make it easy to manage, play and share digital media. The Company also develops and markets software products and services that enable the creation, distribution and consumption of digital media, including audio and video. Additional details on the nature of our business and our segments are in Item 1 of this 10-K.Inherent in our business are various risks and uncertainties, including a limited history of certain of our product and service offerings. RealNetwork success will depend on the acceptance of our technology, products and services and the ability to generate related revenue.In this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 201210-K, RealNetworks, Inc. and subsidiaries is referred to as RealNetworks, the Company, we, us, or our.Basis of Presentation.The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.The consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the periods presented. Operating results for the year ended December31, 2012are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any subsequent quarters or for the year ending December 31,2013.Use of Estimates.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, current economic conditions may require the use of additional estimates, and certain estimates we currently make are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty as a result of the current economic conditions2012 Sale of Patents and Other Technology Assets to Intel Corporation.In the second quarter of 2012, we completed the sale of certain patents, patent applications and related rights held by us, and certain of our assets relating to our next generation video codec technologies to Intel Corporation Intel pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of January26, 2012, between the Company and Intel. In accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement, Intel acquired the assets for a gross cash purchase price of $1200 million. In addition, pursuant to the license agreement, dated as of January26, 2012 the License Agreement, between Intel and the Company, Intel granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid up, irrevocable except as set forth in the License Agreement and worldwide license without the right to grant sublicenses to use the patent assets we sold to Intel in connection with our businesses. The transferability of the License Agreement is limited in the event of a change of control or character of the Company, as set forth in the License Agreement. The proceeds, net of related direct costs, of $1164 millionwere recorded as a gain in the statement of operations2011 Special Dividend and Reverse Stock Split.On July27, 2011, the Companys Board of Directors approved the payment of a special cash dividend of $100per common share and a one-for-four reverse stock split of our common stock. The special dividend was paid on August23, 2011 and totaled $1368 million. The one-for-four reverse stock split was effective at the close of business on August30, 2011. All information related to common stock, stock options, restricted stock units and earnings per share included in the 10-K was retroactively adjusted in 2011 to give effect to the special cash dividend and the reverse stock split, except as otherwise noted. 2010 Rhapsody Restructuring Transaction.  RealNetworks initially formed in 2007 a joint venture with MTV NetworksMTVN to own and operate a business-to-consumer digital audio music service known as Rhapsody. Prior to March31, 2010, we held a 51%interest in Rhapsody and MTVN owned the remaining 49%. On March31, 2010, restructuring transactions involving Rhapsody were completed, and as a result, effective March31, 2010 RealNetworks owned approximately 47%of Rhapsody. Subsequent to the restructuring transaction, we account for our investment in Rhapsody using the equity method of accounting for investments. Prior to the restructuring transaction, Rhapsodys financial position and operating results were consolidated into our financial statements, with MTVNs proportionate share of income loss included in noncontrolling interest in Rhapsody in our statements of operations and MTVNs proportionate share of equity was included in noncontrolling interest in Rhapsody in the balance sheets. As of December31, 2012we owned approximately 45%of Rhapsody. RealNetworks continues to provide certain operational transition services to Rhapsody. These transition services are expected to be completed in early 2013, and are discussed further in Note 19, Related Party Transactions.Revision of Prior Period Financial Statements.  In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of, and for the year ended December 31, 2012, we identified and corrected immaterial errors related to the accounting for our 39equity method investment in Rhapsody. Our investment in Rhapsody is our only equity method investment for all periods presented. We determined that the carrying value for Rhapsody, reported as an equity method investment in our consolidated balance sheets, which were a part of our previously issued audited financial statements, was understated as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 by $156 millionand $125 million, respectively. The immaterial errors relate to certain capital transactions of Rhapsody with MTVN in 2011 and 2010 for which we did not, at the time, appropriately record our share of increase in Rhapsody equity along with a corresponding increase to our shareholders' equity additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of shareholders' equity. These corrections also included related deferred tax adjustments, as disclosed in Note 14. These non-cash corrections did not impact the amount we reported for our share of Rhapsody net loss for any period and thus had no impact on our consolidated statements of operations or cash flows. In accordance with accounting guidance found in ASC 250-10, we assessed the materiality of the errors and concluded that the errors were not material to any of our previously-issued financial statements. In accordance with this accounting guidance, we have revised all affected periods, and the following tables summarize the effects of the immaterial error corrections on the historical consolidated balance sheets and statements of shareholders' equity within these consolidated financial statements for the periods indicated in thousands:As of December 31, 2011As previously  method   paid-in  shareholders'  liabilities and shareholders'  of December 31, 2010As previously  method   paid-in  shareholders'  liabilities and shareholders'  reclassifications have been made to the 2011and 2010consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2012presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Cash and Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments, and Available-for-Sale Securities.We consider all short-term investments with a remaining contractual maturity at date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.We have classified as available-for-sale all marketable debt and equity securities for which there is determinable fair market value and there are no restrictions on our ability to sell. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, based on quoted market prices, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of shareholders equity, net of any applicable income taxes. Investments with remaining contractual maturities of five years or less are classified as short-term because the investments are marketable and highly liquid and we have the ability to utilize them for current operations. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in other income expense, net. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are determined using the specific identification method.Trade Accounts Receivable.Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses and returns in our 40existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowances based on analysis of historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, return history and current economic trends. We review the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns quarterly. Past due balances over 90days and specified other balances are reviewed individually for collectability. All other balances are reviewed on an aggregate basis. Account balances are written off against the allowance after all reasonable means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. We do not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers.Concentration of Credit Risk.Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable. Short-term investments consist of U.S.government and government agency securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. We derive a portion of our revenue from a large number of individual consumers spread globally. We also derive revenue from several large customers. If the financial condition or results of operations of any one of the large customers deteriorates substantially, our operating results could be adversely affected. To reduce credit risk, management performs ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of significant customers. We do not generally require collateral and we maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses on customer accounts when considered necessary.Depreciation and Amortization.Depreciation and amortization of equipment, software, and leasehold improvements are computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term. The useful life of equipment and software is generally threeto fiveyears. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease term. Depreciation and amortization expense during the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010was $129 million, $128 million, and $187 million, respectively.Valuation of Equity Method Investments.We use the equity method in circumstances where we have the ability to exert significant influence, but not control, over an investee or joint venture. We initially record our investment based on a fair value analysis of the investment. For the investment in Rhapsody as of March31, 2010, we used multiple valuation models that were based on assumptions of future results made by management, including operating and cash flow projections, to calculate the fair value since RealNetworks contributed both cash and non-cash items in exchange for its equity interest.We record our percentage interest in the investee recorded income or loss under this method, which will increase or decrease the reported value of our investment. We record investee losses up to the aggregate amount of the investment.We evaluate impairment of an investment accounted for under the equity method only if events and circumstances warrant. An impairment charge would be recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary. In determining if a decline is other than temporary, we consider factors such as the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment has been less than the carrying amount of the investee or joint venture, the near-term and longer-term operating and financial prospects of the investee or joint venture and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery.Deferred Costs. We defer certain costs on projects for service revenues and system sales. Deferred costs consist primarily of direct and incremental costs to customize and install systems, as defined in individual customer contracts, including costs to acquire hardware and software from third parties and payroll and related costs for employees and other third parties. Deferred costs are capitalized during the implementation period.We recognize such costs as a component of cost of revenue, the timing of which is dependent upon the revenue recognition policy by contract. At each balance sheet date, we review deferred costs to ensure they are ultimately recoverable. Any anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized when evidence indicates the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue or if actual deferred costs exceed contractual revenue. Assessing the recoverability of deferred costs is based on significant assumptions and estimates, including future revenue and cost of sales. Significant or sustained decreases in revenue or increases in cost of sales in future periods could result in additional impairments of deferred project costs and prepaid royalty advances. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of such impairments. Should the value of deferred project costs or prepaid royalty advances become impaired, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.As of December31, 2011, we determined that the total estimated costs associated with certain projects exceeded the total estimated revenues expected to be recognized on those projects. As a result, in 2011 we impaired $167 millionin deferred project costs and an additional $33 millionof equipment and software assets that related solely to these projects. The $200 millioncharge in 2011 was included in impairment of deferred project costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss. No such charges were incurred in 2012 or 2010. 41Other Intangible Assets.Other intangible assets consist primarily of the fair value of customer agreements and contracts, and developed technology acquired in business combinations. Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over oneto sevenyears, which approximates their estimated useful lives.We review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value, which is generally determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows. The impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by us, including operating and cash flow projections. Significant or sustained declines in future revenue or cash flows, or adverse changes in our business climate, among other factors, could result in the need to perform an impairment analysis in future interim periods. Goodwill.We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, in our fourth quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate reporting unit carrying values may exceed their fair values. Circumstances that may indicate a reporting unit carrying value exceeds its fair value include, but are not limited to: poor economic performance relative to historical or projected future operating results; significant negative industry, economic or company specific trends; changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the plans for our business;and loss of key personnel.When evaluating goodwill for impairment, based upon our annual test or due to changes in circumstances described above, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than the reporting unit carrying amount including goodwill. If this assessment indicates it is more likely than not, we then compare the carrying value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, we then calculate the implied estimated fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of goodwill for the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value, an impairment charge to current operations is recorded to reduce the carrying value to implied estimated value. Significant judgment is required in determining the reporting units and assessing fair value of the reporting units. Long-Lived Assets.We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value.Fair Value of Financial Instruments.We apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid in transfering a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Our fair value measurements consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk.Research and Development.Costs incurred in research and development are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are capitalized when a products technological feasibility has been established through the date the product is available for general release to customers. Other than internal use software, we have not capitalized any software development costs, as technological feasibility is generally not established until a working model is completed, at which time substantially all development is complete.Revenue Recognition.We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Physical products are considered delivered to the customer once they have been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For online sales, the products or services are considered delivered at the time the products or services are made available, digitally, to the end user.In most arrangements, we contract directly with end user customers, and are the primary obligor. In such arrangements, we recognize revenue on a gross basis. In some cases, we utilize third-party distributors to sell products or services directly to end user customers. In such instances, we recognize revenue on a net basis.In our direct to consumer business, we derive revenue through 1subscriptions of our SuperPass product and our games offerings, 2sales of content downloads, software and licenses and 3the sale of advertising and the distribution of third-party products on our websites and in our games. Consumer subscription products are paid in advance, typically for monthly, quarterly or annual duration. Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the related subscription time period. Revenue from sales of content downloads, software and 42licenses is recognized at the time the product is made available, digitally, to the end user. Revenue generated from advertising on our websites and from advertising and the distribution of third-party products included in our products is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery.We also generate revenue through business-to-business channels by providing services within our Core Products segment enabling mobile carriers to deliver audio and video content to their customers and by selling software licenses and products and related support and other services. Revenue generated from services provided to mobile carriers that enable the delivery of audio and video content to their customers is recognized as the services are provided. Setup fees to build these services are recognized ratably upon launch of the service over the remaining expected term of the service.Non-software revenue arrangements containing multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting, after being evaluated for specific criteria. If the criteria for separation are met, revenue is allocated to the individual units using the relative price method. If the criteria are not met, the elements are treated as one unit of accounting and revenue recognition is delayed until all elements have been delivered. In the case of revenue arrangements containing software, elements are divided into separate units of accounting only when vendor-specific objective evidence has been established. In cases where vendor-specific objective evidence has not been established, undelivered elements are combined into one unit of accounting and are not recognized in revenue until all elements have been delivered. Advertising Expenses.We expense the cost of advertising and promoting our products as incurred. These costs are included in sales and marketing expense and totaled $317 millionin 2012, $357 millionin 2011and $295 millionin 2010. We also incurred $11 millionof advertising expenses with MTVN, a related party, in 2010, with noamounts incurred in 2012or 2011.Foreign Currency.The functional currency of the Companys foreign subsidiaries is the currency of the country in which the subsidiary operates. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into U.S.dollars using rates of exchange in effect at the end of the reporting period. The net gain or loss resulting from translation is shown as translation adjustment and included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity. Income and expense accounts are translated into U.S.dollars using average rates of exchange. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations. Derivative Financial Instruments.We conduct business internationally in several currencies and thus we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. A portion of these risks are managed through the use of financial derivatives, but fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could impact our results of operations and financial position. Our foreign currency risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements.Generally, our practice is to manage foreign currency risk for the majority of material short-term intercompany balances through the use of foreign currency forward contracts. These contracts require us to exchange currencies at rates agreed upon at the contracts inception. Because the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward contracts offsets the related impact on the short-term intercompany balances, these financial instruments help alleviate the risk that might otherwise result from certain changes in currency exchange rates. We do not designate foreign exchange forward contracts related to short-term intercompany accounts as hedges and, accordingly, adjust these instruments to fair value through our results of operations. However, we may periodically hedge a portion of our foreign exchange exposures associated with material firmly committed transactions and long-term investments.All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated a hedge, then depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be recorded immediately in results of operations, or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in results of operations.We had no material amounts of derivatives outstanding at either December 31, 2012 or 2011.Accounting for Taxes Collected from Customers.Our revenues are reported net of sales and other transaction taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities. Income Taxes.We compute income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between financial reporting basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions. Adjustments to the valuation allowance could be required in the future if we estimate that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized is more or less than the net amount we have recorded. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance could have the effect of increasing or decreasing the income tax provision in the statement of operations43Deferred tax assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled.We file numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the U.S. including federal, state and local, as well as foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for tax years before 2008 or state, local, or foreign income tax examinations for years before 1993. RealNetworks, Inc. and/or subsidiaries are under audit by various states and foreign jurisdictions for certain tax years subsequent to 1993.We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. Stock-Based Compensation.Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model or other appropriate valuation models to determine the fair value of stock-based option awards. The fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the award date. For performance-based restricted stock awards, expense is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. We recognize the compensation cost for awards on a straight-line basis for the entire award, over the applicable vesting period. For our employee stock purchase plan, compensation expense is measured based on the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase.The valuation models for stock-based option awards require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility in our common stock price and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used in the valuation models change significantly, stock-based compensation expense for new awards may differ materially in the future from the amounts recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. For all awards, we also estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates and ultimately record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. Noncontrolling Interest.We record noncontrolling interest expense benefit which reflects the portion of the earnings losses of majority-owned entities which are applicable to the noncontrolling interest holders in the consolidated statement of operations. Redeemable noncontrolling interests that are redeemable at either fair value or are based on a formula that is intended to approximate fair value follow our historical disclosure only policy for the redemption feature. Redeemable noncontrolling interests that are redeemable at either a fixed price or are based on a formula that is not akin to fair value are reflected as an adjustment to income attributable to common shareholders based on the difference between accretion as calculated using the terms of the redemption feature and the accretion entry for a hypothetical fair value redemption feature with the remaining amount of accretion to redemption value recorded directly to equity. The 2010 net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Rhapsody is included within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss. We applied this accounting policy to the noncontrolling interest in Rhapsody that was held by MTVN for periods beginning when Rhapsody was formed in August 2007 through the quarter ended March31, 2010. Due to the completion of the restructuring of Rhapsody on March31, 2010, which resulted in our holding approximately 47%of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Rhapsody, this accounting policy no longer applies with respect to our investment as we stopped consolidating Rhapsody on March 31, 2010 and no longer report a noncontrolling interest.Net Income Per Share.Basic net income loss per share EPS available to common shareholders is computed by dividing net income loss attributable to common shareholders adjusted for the impact, in 2010, of MTVNs preferred return in Rhapsody by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS available to common shareholders is computed by dividing net income loss attributable to common shareholders adjusted for the impact, in 2010, of MTVNs preferred return in Rhapsody by the weighted average number of common and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Loss.Accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of December31, 2012and 2011consisted of unrealized gains on investment securities and foreign currency translation losses.The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of any applicable tax, are as follows in  gains on investments, net of tax effects of $846 for 2012 and 2011$26,685$27,318Foreign currency translation  other comprehensive income loss$26,540$24,884For the twelve months endedDecember31, 2012we liquidated the investment in certain of our foreign entities and recorded a net pre-tax gain of $20 millionin Other income expense, net, in the consolidated statement of operations upon the reclassification of the same amount of cumulative foreign exchange translation gain loss from accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the balance sheet. The reclassification adjustment had no related income tax expense or benefit. No reclassification adjustments related to foreign exchange translation amounts occurred in 2011. For the twelve months endedDecember31, 2012we realized pre-tax gains of $43 millionin the consolidated statement of operations related to the sale of a portion of the equity shares we hold in LoEn Entertainment, Inc., with the same amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the balance sheet. The reclassification adjustment had no related income tax expense or benefit. For more information see Note 4, Fair Value Measurements. No reclassification adjustments related to unrealized gains occurred in 2011. For the three years ended December 31, 2012, there were no income tax expense or benefit amounts related to the items included in Other comprehensive income loss on our Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income Loss.Note2.Recent Accounting PronouncementsThere have been no recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the year December31, 2012to be implemented that are of significance or potential significance to RealNetworks.Note3.Rhapsody Joint VentureRestructuring of RhapsodyRealNetworks initially formed in 2007 a joint venture with MTV Networks, a division of Viacom International Inc. MTVN, to own and operate a business-to-consumer digital audio music service known as Rhapsody. Prior to March31, 2010, we held a 51%interest in Rhapsody and MTVN owned the remaining 49%. On March31, 2010, restructuring transactions involving Rhapsody were completed, and as a result, effective March31, 2010 RealNetworks owned approximately 47%of the issued and outstanding stock of Rhapsody. Subsequent to the restructuring transaction, we account for our investment in Rhapsody using the equity method of accounting for investments. As of December31, 2012we owned approximately 45%of the issued and outstanding stock of Rhapsody. As part of the restructuring transaction, RealNetworks contributed $180 millionin cash, the Rhapsody brand and certain other assets, including content licenses, in exchange for shares of convertible preferred stock of Rhapsody, carrying a $100 millionpreference upon certain liquidation events. We also repurchased the international radio business that was previously contributed to Rhapsody by RealNetworks. MTVN contributed a $330 millionadvertising commitment in exchange for shares of common stock of Rhapsody, and MTVNs previous obligation to provide advertising of approximately $111 millionas of December31, 2009 was canceled. In addition, the put and call rights held by RealNetworks and MTVN and MTVNs rights to receive a preferred return in connection with the exercise of MTVNs put right were terminated. As a result of the March 31, 2010 deconsolidation of Rhapsodys operations from our financial statements, we no longer record any operating results for our former Music segment for periods subsequent to March31, 2010. The removal of these assets and liabilities and the creation of the initial equity method investment resulted in a one-time net gain of $109 millionin 2010 recorded in Other income expense, net in our consolidated statement of operations. We determined the fair value of our retained equity interest of approximately 47%to be approximately $297 millionas of March31, 2010. The fair value analysis used multiple valuation models and was based on assumptions of future results made by us, including operating and cash flow projections.As noted above, MTVNs preferred return rights were terminated in 2010 in connection with the restructuring of Rhapsody. Prior to the restructuring, if the appraised value of Rhapsody at a redemption date was less than $4363 million, then the exercise price of the put right would have included a preferred return to MTVN. We previously elected to accrete any excess of the redemption value over the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest as an adjustment to income attributable to 45common shareholders, and adjusted earnings per share for the current quarters accretion of the difference between accretion as calculated using the terms of the redemption feature and the accretion entry for a hypothetical fair value redemption feature. Due to the termination of MTVNs preferred return rights at the completion of the restructuring, we decreased the noncontrolling interest that was on our consolidated balance sheet on March31, 2010 prior to the transaction described above by $104 millionas part of the deconsolidation transactions, of which $37 millionwas an adjustment to income attributable to common shareholders for the purposes of calculating earnings per share for the year ended December31, 2010.RealNetworks continues to provide certain operational transition services to Rhapsody. These transition services are expected to be completed in early 2013, and are discussed further in Note 19, Related Party Transactions.In 2012Rhapsody issued common stock as consideration for acquisitions it made. As RealNetworks did not acquire any additional Rhapsody common stock as part of Rhapsody transactions, our equity interest decreased from approximately 47%in 2011 to approximately 45%in 2012, and we recorded a dilution gain totaling $17 million, which increased our carrying amount for Rhapsody by the same amount. Our policy is to record the gain in equity, as a component of Additional paid in capital. See Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revision of Prior Period Financial Statements, for details on corrections made to our investment balance in Rhapsody related to certain other capital transactions of Rhapsody in 2011 and 2010. As of December 31, 2012 the carrying value of our investment in Rhapsody was $192 million. We recorded our share of losses in the operations of Rhapsody of $57 millionfor the year ended December31, 2012, $79 millionfor the year ended December 31, 2011, and $142 millionfor the nine month period from April 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring BasisCertain of our assets and liabilities are measured at estimated fair value on a non-recurring basis, using Level 3 inputs. These instruments are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances for example, when there is evidence of impairment.

For the year ended December 31, 2012 we recorded a total of $91 millionof restructuring charges for employee separation costs related to this action and for other actions taken in 2012.In the third quarter of 2012 we assigned twoof our existing domestic carrier service contracts for ringback tone, ring tone, and music on demand services to a third party. This action resulted in restructuring charges associated with the contract assignment of $36 millionand asset disposal and other costs of $25 millionin 2012.

There are no shares of SeriesA preferred stock outstanding.Undesignated preferred stock will have rights and preferences that are determinable by the Board of Directors when determination of a new series of preferred stock has been established.Shareholder Rights Plan.On December2, 2008, RealNetworks and Mellon Investor Services LLC entered into an Amended and Restated Shareholder Rights Plan Amended and Restated Rights Plan which amended and restated the existing Shareholder Rights Plan dated December4, 1998, as amended Existing Rights Plan. In connection with the Existing Rights Plan, on October16, 1998, the Companys board of directors declared a dividend of a right to purchase one one-thousandth of a shareof the Companys SeriesA preferred stock Right for each outstanding shareof the Companys common stock on December14, 1998 Record Date. Each share of common stock issued after the Record Date will be issued with an attached Right. The Rights will not immediately be exercisable and detachable from the common stock. The Rights will become exercisable and detachable only following the earlier of the acquisition of the Company by a person or a group of 15 percentor more of the outstanding common stock or 10 daysfollowing the announcement of a tender or exchange offer for 15 percentor more of the outstanding common stock Distribution Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Robert Glaser, the Companys Chairman of the Board of Directors, is excluded as a person who can trigger the Distribution Date so long as he does not increase his beneficial ownership of shares of the Companys common stock above the number of shares he holds as of the date of the Amended and Restated Rights Plan, except for shares of the Companys common stock he acquires from the exercise of stock options or from stock awards granted to him in connection with his employment with the Company. After the Distribution Date, each Right will entitle the holder to purchase for $12000Exercise Price one one-thousandth 1/1000thof a shareof the Companys SeriesA preferred stock with economic terms similar to that of one share of the Companys common stock. Upon a person or a group acquiring 15 percentor more of the outstanding common stock, each Right will allow the holder other than the acquirer to purchase common stock or securities of the Company having a then current market value of two times the Exercise Price of the Right. In the event that following the acquisition of 15 percentof the common stock by an acquirer, the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination or 50 percentor more of the Companys assets or earning power are sold, each Right will entitle the holder to purchase for the Exercise Price, common stock or securities of the acquirer having a then current market value of two times the Exercise Price. In certain circumstances, the Rights may be redeemed by the Company at a redemption price of $0001per Right. If not earlier exchanged or redeemed, the Rights will expire on December2, 2018.Note13.Employee Stock and Benefit PlansEquity Compensation Plans.We maintain equity incentive plans under which we may grant various types of equity awards to employees and Directors. We have granted time-vest and performance-vest stock options and time-vest and performance-vest restricted stock. Generally, options vest based on continuous employment, over a two, fouror five-year period. The options generally expire in either sevenor tenyears from the date of grant and are exercisable at the market value of the common stock at the grant date. Time-vest restricted stock awards generally vest based on continuous employment over a oneor two-year period. Performance-vest restricted stock awards vest if the specified performance targets are met and the grantee remains employed over the required period. The performance targets for these awards are generally based on the achievement of company-specific financial results. For performance-based restricted stock awards, expense is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. We issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock. As of December 31, 2012 there were 40 millionshares of common stock authorized for future equity awards. Each restricted stock unit granted 52reduces and each restricted stock unit forfeited or canceled increases the shares available for future grant by a factor of 16shares. We also have an employee stock purchase plan, under which 06 millionshares of common stock are authorized for future issuance.Stock-based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations includes amounts related to stock options, restricted stock, and employee stock purchase plans and was as follows in thousands:Years Ended December31,201220112010Total stock-based compensation  total stock-based compensation amounts disclosed above are recorded in their respective line items within operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations, including amounts that are reported in Restructuring and other charges. No stock-based compensation was capitalized as part of the cost of an asset as of December31, 2012, 2011, or 2010. As of December31, 2012, we had $78 millionof total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock awards. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately threeyears.As discussed in Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Stock-Based Compensation, the valuation models for stock option awards require various highly judgmental assumptions. The assumption for the expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar awards, including the contractual terms, vesting schedules, and expectations of future employee behavior. Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock for the related expected term. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S.Treasury zero-coupon issues with a term equivalent to the expected term of the stock options. Notwithstanding the special cash dividend of $100per share paid on our common stock during the quarter ended September30, 2011, the dividend yield is estimated at zero because we do not currently anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.The fair value of options granted determined using the Black-Scholes model used the following weighted average assumptions:Years Ended December 31,201220112010Expected dividend yield Risk-free interest rate050%131%156%Expected term  connection with RealNetwork special cash dividend of $100per share of common stock paid in August 2011, and pursuant to the terms of the 2005 Plan, adjustments were made to the aggregate number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2005 Plan to reflect the special dividend in 2011. As a result of these adjustments, in 2011 the previously outstanding number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2005 Plan was increased by approximately 18 millionshares. Also in connection with the special cash dividend and one-for-four reverse stock split in August 2011, we made equitable adjustments to outstanding options and restricted stock units in accordance with our equity compensation plans. For all awards, the fair value of the award before and after the dividend and one-for-four reverse stock split remained the same, thus no incremental expense was recognized in the financial statements as a result of these equitable adjustments.Restricted stock unit and award activity was as follows shares are in thousands: 53SharesWeighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Per ShareTotal Fair Value of Vested Awards 000Nonvested shares, December 31,  shares, December 31,  shares, December 31,  shares, December 31, 20121,249$852At December 31, 2012 the aggregate intrinsic value of restricted stock awards was $94 millionand the weighted average remaining contractual term was approximately 1 year.A summary of stock option activity is set forth in the table below.

Stock Option Exchange.As described in our prior filings with the SEC, in 2009 we completed a one-time stock option exchange program designed to provide eligible employees an opportunity to exchange certain outstanding underwater stock options for a lesser amount of new options to be granted with lower exercise prices. Stock options eligible for exchange were those with an exercise price per share greater than $1392. A total of 47 millioneligible stock options were tendered by employees and 20 millionnew stock options were granted in 2009 in exchange for the eligible stock options surrendered. The exercise price of the new stock options was $1052, which was the closing price of our common stock on December17, 2009. Employee Stock Purchase Plan.Our current Employee Stock Purchase Plan the 2007 ESPP allows an eligible employee to purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal to 85percent of the fair market value of the common stock at the end of the semi-annual offering periods, subject to certain limitations. Under the 2007 ESPP, 102,700, 110,000, and 90,250shares were purchased during the years ended December31, 2012, 2011and 2010, respectively.Retirement Savings Plan.We have a salary deferral plan 401kPlanthat covers substantially all employees. Eligible employees may contribute a portion of their eligible compensation to the plan up to limits stated in the plan documents, not to exceed the dollar amounts set by applicable laws. During the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, we matched 50%of employee contributions to the plan, on up to threepercent of participating employees compensation, and contributed $10 million, $11 million, and $14 million, respectively, in matching contributions. We can terminate the matching contributions at our discretion. We have no other post-employment or post-retirement benefit plans.Note14.Income TaxesComponents of income loss before income taxes in thousands:Years Ended December 31,201220112010United States   loss before income  of income tax expense benefit in thousands:Years Ended December 31,201220112010Current:United States  and   States federal22,02922,006State and   income tax expense  tax expense differs from expected income tax expense computed by applying the U.S.federal income tax rate of 35% due to the following in thousands:55Years Ended December 31,201220112010United States federal tax expense benefit at statutory  taxes, net of United States federal tax  in valuation  stock compensation341571992Impact of non-U.S. jurisdictional tax rate  income attributable to noncontrolling interest1,018Extraterritorial Income Exclusion and previously acquired NOLs32,232Research and development tax  pricing adjustment2,426Increase reversal of unrecognized tax  income tax expense  deferred tax assets are comprised of the following in thousands:December 31,20122011Deferred tax assets:United States federal net operating loss  expenses8,46114,056Research and development tax credit  minimum tax credit carryforward3,6983,068Net unrealized loss on investments9510,943Capital loss carryforwards5,297Accrued loss on excess office facilities1,340997Stock-based compensation13,63916,101State net operating loss  net operating loss  revenue357495Equipment, software, and leasehold  deferred tax assets117,660139,900Less valuation allowance See Note 190,79999,571Gross deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance26,86140,329Deferred tax liabilities:Other intangible assets6881,550Net unrealized gains and basis differences on investments See Note   software development costs4,3173,504Gross deferred tax  deferred tax assets$3,455$23,428Income tax receivables were $84 millionand $67 millionat December31, 2012and 2011, respectively.

The net change in valuation allowance was an $88 milliondecrease and a $10 milliondecrease during the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 56The 2012 net decrease in valuation allowance was primarily the result of an $83 milliondecrease due to unrealized gains on investments, and a $05 milliondecrease due to changes in worldwide attributes and other assets.We maintain a partial valuation allowance of $908 millionfor our deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding their realization as of December 31, 2012. As part of the immaterial error correction related to the accounting for our equity method investment in Rhapsody as described in Note 1, we revised our deferred tax liability balance by $56 millionat December 31, 2011 and allocated the corresponding change in valuation allowance directly to the related components of shareholders' equity on the consolidated balance sheets. This immaterial error correction on the tax footnote disclosure had no impact on any of our financial statements for all periods presented.RealNetwork U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards totaled $474 millionand $807 millionat December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The decrease is mainly due to the utilization of net operating losses as a result of the sale of certain patent assets and other technology assets to Intel Corporation in 2012. The remaining net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2012 are from the U.S. taxable losses in 2010 and 2011 and from acquired subsidiaries that are limited under Internal Revenue Code Section 382.  These net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire between 2024 and 2031. RealNetwork alternative minimum tax credit carryforward increased from $31 millionas of December 31, 2011 to $37 millionas of December 31, 2012.  The alternative minimum tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely. RealNetwork U.S. federal research and development tax credit carryforward totaled $221 millionand $215 millionat December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. The research and development credit carryforwards expire between 2020 and 2031.Because the enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 the Act was not completed until 2013 certain provisions of the Act benefiting our 2012 federal taxes, including the extension of the research and development tax credit for 2012, cannot be recognized in our 2012 financial results and instead will be reflected in our 2013 financial results. As of December31, 2012and 2011, we had $40 millionand $167 millionof unrecognized tax benefits, respectively.The decrease in unrecognized tax benefits is the result of a release of $138 million, which includes accrued interest, through the successful defense of our positions, and ultimate settlement and closure of foreign and state tax examinations. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate if recognized was $04 millionas of December 31, 2012 and $135 millionas of December 31, 2011. As of December31, 2012and December31, 2011, we had approximately $01 millionand $08 millionof accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, respectively. To the extent interest and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision. We do not anticipate that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next twelve months.

We lease office facilities under various operating leases expiring through 2019. Other contractual obligations primarily relate to minimum contractual payments due to content and other service providers. Future minimum payments as of December 31, 2012 are as follows in  minimum payments$26,137$140$26,277Of the total office lease future minimum payments, $34 millionis recorded in accrued loss on excess office facilities at December31, 2012.Rent expense during the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, was $91 million, $92 million, and $106 million, respectively. These amounts are net of sublease income of $10 millionin each of the years ended December 31,2012, 2011, and 2010.Litigation. On July3, 2012, a lawsuit was filed against us by VoiceAge Corporation in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. VoiceAge asserts that we have breached our payment obligations under the terms of a patent license agreement between us and VoiceAge in respect of distribution of specified codec technology and is seeking a material amount of damages. We have removed the proceedings to New York federal court. Although discovery commenced on January 4, 2013, the court stayed further discovery on January 10, 2013. We dispute VoiceAges allegations and the magnitude of the claimed damages, and, because we are in the early stages of this litigation and due to the uncertainties inherent in this matter, we are unable to estimate the range of possible loss that could result from this litigation.On May24, 2012, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against us in Illinois federal court by an individual consumer subscriber to one of our subscription products. The lawsuit asserted that certain online marketing practices of our marketing affiliates violate federal and state laws. In October 2012, we settled this matter for an immaterial amount.On October 28, 2011 and November1, 2011, respectively, two lawsuits were filed by Callertone Innovations, LLC in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The first lawsuit was against T-Mobile USA, Inc. and the second lawsuit was against MetroPCS Wireless, Inc. and MetroPCS Communications, Inc., which we collectively refer to as MetroPCS. The lawsuits allege that T-Mobile and MetroPCS, respectively, infringe Callertones patents by providing ringback tone services. We 58agreed to indemnify each of T-Mobile and MetroPCS against the claims based on an indemnity that is claimed to be owed by us. The respective complaint was served on T-Mobile on January 16, 2012 and on MetroPCS on January14, 2012. We filed our answers to each complaint on April9, 2012. In each matter, we dispute the plaintiffs allegations regarding both the validity of its patents and its claims of infringement against T-Mobile and MetroPCS, respectively. Because we are in the early stages of this litigation and due to the uncertainties inherent in these matters, we are unable to estimate the range of possible loss that could result from this litigation.In July 2010, the Washington State Office of the Attorney General, or Washington AG, sent a letter referencing complaints from consumers relating to RealNetworks various consumer products since 2005. In light of the ensuing investigation commenced by the Washington AG, we accrued an estimated loss totaling $24 millionduring the first quarter of 2012. On May24, 2012, we resolved the investigation through the entry of a consent decree filed in King County, Washington Superior Court. The consent decree provided for injunctive relief related to certain consumer marketing practices, for consumer restitution of up to $20 million, and for payment of the Washington AGs costs and attorneys fees in the amount of $04 million. The consent decree resolved with prejudice all issues raised by the Washington AG in the complaint filed in the matter. Subsequent to the 90-day customer claims period that followed the filing of the consent decree, during the third quarter of 2012 it was determined that we would make payments of $04 millionto eligible claimants, $05 millionto the Washington AG as indirect restitution, and the $04 millionto the Washington AG to cover its legal costs. The total liability of $24 millionoriginally accrued as of March 31, 2012 was reduced by the remaining amount of $11 millionin the third quarter of 2012. Substantially all payments related to this matter have been made as of December 31, 2012. On April25, 2007, a lawsuit was filed by Greenville Communications, LLC in Greenville, Mississippi against a number of cell phone carriers, including our partners T-Mobile USA, Inc. and Alltel Corporation, alleging that they infringe its patents by providing ringback tone services. We agreed to indemnify T-Mobile and Alltel against the claims based on an indemnity that is claimed to be owed by us. On August27, 2007, our motion to transfer this matter to the U.S.District Court for the District of New Jersey was granted. The parties briefed claims construction, but the case was subsequently stayed pending reexamination of the patents at issue. On December10, 2009, the U.S.Patent and Trademark Office issued notice of its intent to issue reexamination certificates for the patents in suit. The District Court lifted the stay on the litigation on January29, 2010 and discovery resumed. On September28, 2011, the District Court held a claims construction hearing, and on May 10, 2012, the District Court issued a non-infringement judgment that was favorable to us and the other defendants. On December 4, 2012, Greenville appealed the claims construction order and the judgment, and the defendants filed a reply brief on January 28, 2013. Because we are in the early stages of the appeals process and due to the uncertainties inherent in this matter, we are unable to estimate the range of possible loss that could result from this litigation. From time to time we are, and expect to continue to be, subject to legal proceedings, governmental investigations and claims in the ordinary course of business, including employment claims, contract-related claims, and claims of alleged infringement of third-party patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights. These claims, including those described above, even if not meritorious, could force us to spend significant financial and managerial resources. We are not aware of any other legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or taken together, a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. However, we may incur substantial expenses in defending against third-party claims. In addition, given the broad distribution of some of our consumer products, any individual claim related to those products could give rise to liabilities that may be material to us. In the event of a determination adverse to us, we may incur substantial monetary liability, and/or be required to change our business practices. Either of these could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial  the ordinary course of business, RealNetworks is subject to potential obligations for standard indemnification and warranty provisions that are contained within many of our customer license and service agreements, as described below.Warranty provisions contained within our customer license and service agreements are generally consistent with those prevalent in our industry. The duration of our product warranties generally does not exceed 90days following delivery of our products. Nearly all of our carrier contracts obligate us to indemnify our carrier customer for certain liabilities that may be incurred by them.We do not maintain accruals for warranty-related obligations as we do not have a history of incurring such losses. We have, however, received claims for indemnification from certain of our carrier customers.See Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, for a discussion of these indemnification claims.As discussed in Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we sold certain patents and other technology assets to Intel pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, we have specific obligations to indemnify Intel for breaches of the representations and warranties we made, and covenants we agreed to, in the Asset Purchase Agreement and for certain potential future intellectual property infringement claims brought by 59a third party against Intel. The amount of any potential liabilities related to our indemnification obligations will not be determined until a claim has been made, but the Asset Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify Intel up to the amount of the gross purchase price we received in the sale.Note18.Segment InformationRealNetworks reports threereportable segments based on factors such as how we manage our operations and how our Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews results. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker is considered to be the CEO Staff CEOS, which includes the interim Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and certain Senior Vice Presidents. The CEOS reviews financial information presented on both a consolidated basis and on a business segment basis, accompanied by certain disaggregated information about products and services, geographical regions and corporate expenses for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance. The accounting policies used to derive segment results are the same as those described in Note1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The performance evaluation of the CEOS does not include any segment asset information.The threereportable segments areCore Products,Emerging Products and Games. See Item 1, Business - Segments, in this 10-K for additional details on each of the three segments. In addition, we continue to present financial results for our former Music segment on a historical basis only for a portion of 2010. The Music segment primarily included financial results and operating performance of our Rhapsody joint venture, which was restructured as of March31, 2010 and deconsolidated from our reported results, as described in more detail in Note 3, Rhapsody Joint Venture.Corporate overhead expenses, including but not limited to finance, legal, stock compensation and headquarters facilities are reported in the aggregate as Corporate expenses and are not reflected in segment results for the business segments described in the preceding paragraph. Corporate amounts in 2012also include the gain on sale of patent and other technology assets, net of costs. Only direct business segment expenses, such as research and development, marketing and certain other business shared services are reflected in the associated business segment results.Segment results for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011and 2010were as follows in thousands:Core  of  of deferred costs19,329Gross     of  of deferred costs633Gross   income   of    income  revenue$35,733Cost of revenue21,864Gross profit13,869Operating expenses13,911Operating income  of revenue$3,357$416$2,932Gain on sale of patents and other technology assets, net of costs116,353Operating  income  customers consist primarily of consumers and corporations located in the U.S., Europe, and various foreign countries.

Subsequent to the restructuring transaction, we are obligated to provide Rhapsody with certain support services. These support services are expected to be completed in early 2013, unless earlier terminated by Rhapsody. The support services include information technology and limited operational support provided directly to Rhapsody. The amount of these and other support service costs were based on various measures depending on the service provided, including vendor fees, an allocation of fixed costs and time employees spend on providing services to Rhapsody. RealNetworks allocates the cost of providing these support services and records such allocation as a reduction to the related expense in the period for which it was 61incurred. During the years ended December 31,2012, 2011, and 2010we charged Rhapsody $08 million, $22 million, and $32 million, respectively, for the support services. In 2012 we made payments to Rhapsody totaling $42 millionrelated to the settlement of certain amounts we previously accrued for, as provided for in the agreements under the Rhapsody restructuring transaction described in Note 3, Rhapsody Joint Venture.Transactions with LoEn Entertainment, Inc.In 2008, RealNetworks acquired approximately 11%of the outstanding shares of LoEn Entertainment, Inc. LoEn. We paid market price for the common shares of LoEn, which are traded on the Korean Securities Dealers Automated Quotations. Our investment in LoEn is treated as an equity investment of a public company and is marked-to-market each period with resulting unrealized gains or losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss. During the years ended December 31,2012, 2011, and 2010, we recorded revenue from LoEn of $181 million, $203 million, and $180 million, respectively. Revenue consisted primarily of sales of application service provider services, which include sales of ringback tones, music on demand, video on demand, and intercarrier messaging services. Associated with these transactions, we also recorded accounts receivable of $25 millionas of December31, 2012. Accounts payable and cost of revenue associated with LoEn as of and for the periods ended December31, 2012and 2011were nominal.Note20.Quarterly Information UnauditedThe following table summarizes the unaudited statement of operations for each quarter of 2012and 2011in thousands, except per share  2Mar312012Net   loss  income loss attributable to common  net income loss per share available to common  net income loss per share available to common    loss  income loss attributable to common  net income loss per share available to common  net income loss per share available to common  sum of the quarterly net income per share amounts will not necessarily equal net income per share for the year due to the use of weighted average quarterly shares and the effects of rounding2In the quarter ended June 30, 2012, we recognized a net gain of $1179 millionfrom the sale to Intel of certain patents, patent applications, and related rights. The net gain for the full year 2012 totaled $1164 million. See Note1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional details3The quarter ended December31, 2011included impairments of deferred costs of $200 million, described more fully in Note1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and an income tax benefit of $226 millionresulting from a release of a portion of the valuation allowance, as described more fully in Note 14, Income Taxes62REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and ShareholdersRealNetworks, Inc.:We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of RealNetworks, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2012and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss, shareholders equity and noncontrolling interest, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2012. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of RealNetworks, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2012and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2012in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, RealNetworks, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated March18, 2013expressed an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting./s/KPMG LLPSeattle, WashingtonMarch18, 201363REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and ShareholdersRealNetworks, Inc.:We have audited RealNetworks, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. RealNetworks, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Item 9Ab. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A material weakness related to management ineffective control over the review and reconciliation of the equity method investment balance to the investee financial statements has been identified and included in management assessment.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of RealNetworks, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2012and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss, shareholders equity and noncontrolling interest, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2012. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2012 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March18, 2013, which expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.In our opinion, because of the effect of the aforementioned material weakness on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, RealNetworks, Inc. has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO./s/KPMG LLPSeattle, WashingtonMarch18, 201364Item 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments16Item 2.Properties16Item 3.Legal Proceedings16Item! 4.Mine Safety Disclosures17PARTIIItem 5.Controls and Proceduresa Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2012. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2012, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as described below. b Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15f of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2012 based on those criteria because of the existence of the material weakness described below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, we did not design an effective control to review the equity method investment balance and to reconcile the balance to our proportionate share of the equity reported in our investee Rhapsody financial statements. This material weakness resulted in an immaterial error correction related to the equity method investment and additional paid-in capital presented in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of shareholders' equity for the periods ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 and also related to deferred tax liability and valuation allowance amounts presented as of December 31, 2011 in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements, and results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our financial statements could occur and not be detected. For details, see Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revision to Prior Period Financial Statements. Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an adverse report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 which is included in Item 8 in this 10-K. c Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2012 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During the first quarter of 2013, we identified the material weakness described above and designed and implemented a new control process that entails a detailed reconciliation of our equity method investment balance to the latest financial statement balances of our investee. As a result of this enhancement in the design of our controls, the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting has been addressed as of the date of filing this 10-K65
