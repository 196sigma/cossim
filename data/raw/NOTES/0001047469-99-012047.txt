18 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES GENERAL
Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. the Company is an internationally
recognized credit rating agency that provides ratings and research on corporate,
structured and sovereign financings, as well as insurance claims paying ability.
The Company has offices in Chicago, New York, London and Hong Kong and operates
directly or through international partners in North America, South America,
Europe, Asia and Africa. The Company is also a designated rating agency in
Japan.
On October 31, 1994, the spin-off of the Company from its former parent
company, Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd., formerly Duff & Phelps Corporation
D, was finalized. The Company shares, held by D, were distributed
October 31, 1994, to D shareholders of record on October 26, 1994, as a
tax-free distribution for which a favorable tax ruling was obtained from the
Internal Revenue Service. D shareholders received one of the Company shares
for every three shares held of D common stock, and cash payments were made in
lieu of fractional shares. The distribution resulted in the Company operating as
a free-standing entity whose common stock is publicly traded on the New York
Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DCR.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements. In addition, they affect the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include those
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses directly attributable to the
Company operations in the periods presented. Certain reclassifications have
been made to prior year financial statements to conform with the current
presentation.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
During July 1994, the Company organized a U.S. subsidiary, Duff & 
Phelps Credit Rating Co. of Europe, with an office located in London, 
England. In July 1996, the Company organized a U.S. subsidiary, Duff & Phelps 
Credit Rating Co. of Asia, with an office in Hong Kong. The consolidated 
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned 
subsidiaries, Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. of Europe and Duff & Phelps 
Credit Rating Co. of Asia. All significant intercompany balances and 
transactions have been eliminated.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share were computed using the weighted average number 
of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding for each 
of the periods presented. Common stock equivalents are based on outstanding 
stock options under a non-qualified stock option plan.
Following is a reconciliation of the denominator used to calculate
basic earnings per share to the denominator used to calculate diluted earnings
per share for the years ended December 31 in thousands                    19                           1998    1997    1996

Basic Weighted Average Shares Outstanding      4,767   4,986   5,416
Stock Options Outstanding              1,310   1,179   1,085
Reduction in Shares for Treasury Stock Proceeds    882   835   655
Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding     5,195   5,330   5,846
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Rating revenues are typically recognized when services rendered for
credit ratings are complete, generally when billed. Revenues are dependent, in
large part, on levels of debt issuance. The Company fee schedule depends on
the type and amount of securities rated and the complexity of securities issued.
Research revenues are billed in advance and amortized over the subscription
period. Certain monitoring fees are billed in advance and are amortized over the
length of the life of the security.
GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill and intangible assets are shown net of accumulated
amortization. Goodwill is amortized over its estimated remaining life of
approximately 29 years, and intangible assets are amortized over remaining lives
of one through 10 years.
The Company periodically evaluates whether significant events have 
occurred that may require a revision of the estimated useful life of goodwill 
and intangible assets or an impairment of the recoverability of remaining 
balances. The Company uses an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows over 
the remaining useful life of goodwill and intangible assets to measure 
recoverability. Management believes that the full amount of goodwill and 
intangible assets is recoverable.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
Office furniture and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
remaining lives of the assets, typically three to 10 years. Leasehold 
improvements are amortized over the remaining lives of the related leases 
which are one to 10 years.
2  RELATED PARTIES SERVICE FEES PAID TO D
A name use fee agreement in effect between the Company and the 
former parent requiring payment of $20 million per year is included in the 
Company financial results for the years presented. Effective September 30, 
2000, the name use fee reduces to $10,000 per year.
SERVICE FEES PAID TO THE COMPANY
The Company provides the former parent with fixed-income research 
services for an annual fee of $09 million. For the periods presented, the 
fixed-income research fees are included in revenue. The fixed-income research 
agreement expires on September 30, 2000.
20 3  OTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS     The Company other long-term investments are composed of 
investments made in international rating agency partnerships in Argentina, 
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, India, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, 
Pakistan, Peru, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, and Turkey.
4  LINE OF CREDIT AND LONG-TERM DEBT     At December 31, 1998, the Company had current debt obligations of 
$15 million, at an interest rate of 60 percent due on December 31, 1999, 
under the Company $200 million revolving credit facility. At December 31, 
1997, long-term debt totaled $70 million at a weighted average interest rate 
of approximately 64 percent.
The credit agreement contains financial covenants that require the 
Company to maintain certain ratios and satisfy certain financial tests, 
including restrictions on the ability to incur indebtedness and limitations 
on the amount of capital expenditures, common stock dividends and advances to 
subsidiaries. The Company was in compliance with such covenants for all years 
presented.
5  LITIGATION MATTERS     The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to 
various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. Management 
believes that there are no proceedings pending against the Company or any of 
its subsidiaries which, if determined adversely, would have a material 
adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the 
Company.
6  INCOME TAXES     The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 109, Accounting for 
Income Taxes, which requires the use of the asset and liability method of 
accounting for income taxes.
Income tax expense was as follows for the years ended December 31

The Plan is administered by a committee of the Board of Directors. 
As of December 31, 1998, options to purchase 1,310,157 common shares were 
granted and outstanding under the Plan; 1,273,742 were held by the Company 
employees, officers, and directors, and 36,415 were held by the former parent 
employees, officers, and directors. The options outstanding vest and become 
exercisable on average in even annual installments over three years at a 
weighted average exercise price of $1480. Options held by participants 
terminate no later than 10 years from the date of grant.
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, 
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in 
accounting for the Plan. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been 
recognized for its stock-based compensation plan.
Had compensation cost for the Company stock option plan been 
determined based on the average fair value at the grant date for option 
awards under the Plan consistent with the methodology prescribed under 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for 
Stock-Based Compensation, the Company net income would have been reduced 
by approximately $408,085 in 1998, $245,210 in 1997, and $102,136 in 1996. 
Basic earnings per share would have been reduced by $08 in 1998, $05 in 
1997 and $02 in 1996. Diluted earnings per share would have been reduced by 
$07 in 1998, $05 in 1997, and $02 in 1996.
The average fair value of the options granted in 1998 is estimated 
at $2094 per option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes 
option-pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield of 26 
percent; volatility of 2021 percent; risk-free interest rate of 498 
percent; assumed forfeiture rate of 5 percent per year and an expected life 
of 10 years.
23     The average fair value of the options granted in 1997 is estimated 
at $1816 per option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option 
pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield of 28 percent; 
volatility of 2485 percent; risk-free interest rate of 562 percent; assumed 
forfeiture rate of 5 percent per year and an expected life of 10 years.
The average fair value of the options granted in 1996 is estimated 
at $1019 per option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option 
pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield of 45 percent; 
volatility of 1825 percent; risk-free interest rate of 626 percent; assumed 
forfeiture rate of 5 percent per year and an expected life of 10 years.

the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test 
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used 
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the 
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide 
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Duff & Phelps
