69 Table of Contents Controls and Procedures aEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures Management of the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of DTE Energys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as
defined in Exchange Act Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e as of December31, 2007, which is the end of
the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such controls and procedures are effective in
ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Due to the inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any disclosure controls and procedures,
management cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of its disclosure controls and
procedures will be attained. bManagements report on internal control over financial reporting The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control system was designed to provide
reasonable assurance to the Companys management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation
and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that a control may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2007. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSOin Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on our assessment, management believes that, as of December
31, 2007, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those
criteria. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements
included in this annual report has issued an attestation report on the Companys internal control
over financial reporting. cChanges in internal control over financial reporting The Company has established a formal assessment process and related procedures to evaluate the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting using criteria specified by COSO. The
assessment process is comprehensive in scope, utilizes internal and external resources and involves
many individuals at various levels of the Company in the design, testing and evaluation of internal
control. As part of the evaluation and assessment process, the Company has been improving the design and
operating effectiveness of many entity-level and process-level controls. Control testing and
remediation activities provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that a material weakness in
internal control over financial reporting will be avoided. The inherent limitations of our current
internal controls, a portion of which are manual by their nature, contribute to the potential for
control deficiencies. Management does not believe any areas requiring further improvement
constitute a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2007. In April2007, we began implementing the second phase of our Enterprise Business Systems EBS
project. EBS is an enterprise resource planning system initiative to improve existing processes and
to implement new core information systems, relating to finance, human resources, supply chain and
work management. Changes have been made to many aspects of our internal control over financial
reporting to adapt to EBS. Management continues to support, sustain and monitor our ongoing
continuous improvement efforts in connection with the transition to EBS, to ensure that the
transition to EBS does not have a material negative impact on our internal control over financial
reporting. 70 Table of Contents There have been no other changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during
the quarter ended December31, 2007 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. 71 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of DTE Energy Company We have audited the consolidated statements of financial position of DTE Energy Company and
subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in shareholders equity and comprehensive income
for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedules listed in the Index at . These financial statements and
financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of DTE Energy Company and subsidiaries at December31, 2007 and 2006, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements of the Company taken as a whole, present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. As discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, in connection with the required
adoption of a new accounting standard, the Company changed its method of accounting for uncertainty
in income taxes on January1, 2007. As discussed in Notes 17 and
18 to the consolidated financial
statements, in connection with the required adoption of new accounting standards, in 2006 the
Company changed its method of accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans
and share based payments, respectively. As discussed in Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements, in connection with the required
adoption of new accounting standards, in 2005 the Company changed its
method of accounting for asset retirement obligations.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2007, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and
our report dated March7, 2008
expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. S/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP Detroit, Michigan
March7, 2008 72 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of DTE Energy Company We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of DTE Energy Company and
subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements report on internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as
of and for the year ended December31, 2007 of the Company and
our report dated March7, 2008
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Companys adoption of new accounting
standards. S/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP Detroit, Michigan

See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 78 Table of Contents DTE Energy Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Corporate Structure DTE Energy owns the following businesses   
Detroit Edison, an electric utility engaged in the generation, purchase, distribution
and sale of electric energy to approximately 22million customers in southeast Michigan   
MichCon, a natural gas utility engaged in the purchase, storage, transmission,
distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 13million customers throughout
Michigan; and   
Our four non-utility segments are involved in 1 coal transportation and marketing, gas
pipelines processing and storage; 2 unconventional gas project development and production;
3 power and industrial projects; and 4 energy marketing and trading operations. Detroit Edison and MichCon are regulated by the MPSC. The FERC regulates certain activities of
Detroit Edisons business as well as various other aspects of businesses under DTE Energy. In
addition, the Company is regulated by other federal and state regulatory agencies including the
NRC, the EPA and MDEQ. References in this report to Company or DTE are to DTE Energy and its subsidiaries,
collectively. Principles of Consolidation The Company consolidates all majority owned subsidiaries and investments in entities in which it
has controlling influence. Non-majority owned investments are accounted for using the equity method
when the Company is able to influence the operating policies of the investee. Non-majority owned
investments include investments in limited liability companies, partnerships or joint ventures.
When the Company does not influence the operating policies of an investee, the cost method is used.
These consolidated financial statements also reflect the Companys proportionate interests in
certain jointly owned utility plant. The Company eliminates all intercompany balances and
transactions. For entities that are considered variable interest entities, the Company applies the provisions of
FIN 46-R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No51. Basis of Presentation The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared using accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These accounting principles require management
to use estimates and assumptions that impact reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from
the Companys estimates. Revenues Revenues from the sale and delivery of electricity, and the sale, delivery and storage of natural
gas are recognized as services are provided. Detroit Edison and MichCon record revenues for
electric and gas provided but unbilled at the end of each month. Detroit Edisons accrued revenues include a component for the cost of power sold that is
recoverable through the PSCR mechanism. MichCons accrued revenues include a component for the cost

the MPSC permit Detroit Edison and MichCon to recover prudent and reasonable supply costs. Any
overcollection or undercollection of costs, including interest, will be reflected in future rates.
See Note 5. Non-utility businesses recognize revenues as services are provided and products are delivered. The
Energy Trading segment records in revenues net unrealized derivative gains and losses on energy
trading contracts, including those to be physically settled. Net gains or losses on foreign
currency derivatives are reported in Other income or Other expenses, respectively. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income is the change in common shareholders equity during a period from transactions
and events from non-owner sources, including net income. As shown in the following table, amounts
recorded to other comprehensive income at December31, 2007 include unrealized gains and losses
from derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges, unrealized gains and losses on available for
sale securities, and changes in benefit obligations, consisting of deferred
actuarial losses, prior service costs and transition amounts related
to pension and other postretirement benefit plans, pursuant to SFAS No158.

Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks and temporary investments purchased
with remaining maturities of three months or less. Restricted cash consists of funds held to
satisfy requirements of certain debt and partnership operating agreements. Restricted cash
designated for interest and principal payments within one year is classified as a current asset.
Inventories The Company values fuel inventory and materials and supplies at average cost. Gas inventory at MichCon is determined using the last-in, first-out LIFOmethod. At December31,
2007, the replacement cost of gas remaining in storage exceeded the $32million LIFO cost by $288
million. During 2007, MichCon liquidated 95billion cubic feet of prior years LIFO layers. The
liquidation reduced 2007 cost of gas by approximately $30million, but had no impact on earnings as
a result of the GCR mechanism. At December31, 2006, the replacement cost of gas remaining in
storage exceeded the $77million LIFO cost by $236million. During 2006, MichCon liquidated 51
billion cubic feet of prior years LIFO layers. The liquidation reduced 2006 cost of gas by
approximately $1million, but had no impact on earnings as a result of the GCR mechanism. The Energy Trading segment uses the average cost method for its gas in inventory. 80 Table of Contents Property, Retirement and Maintenance, and Depreciation and Depletion Summary of property by classification as of December31

Property is stated at cost and includes construction-related labor, materials, overheads and an
allowance for funds used during construction AFUDC. AFUDC capitalized during 2007 and 2006 was
approximately $32million and $22million, respectively. The cost of properties retired, less
salvage value, at Detroit Edison and MichCon is charged to accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred, except for Fermi 2.
Approximately $4million of expenses related to the anticipated Fermi 2 refueling outage scheduled
for 2009 were accrued at December31, 2007. Amounts are being accrued on a pro-rata basis over an
18-month period that began in November2007. This accrual of outage costs matches the regulatory
recovery of these costs in rates set by the MPSC. The Company bases depreciation provisions for utility property at Detroit Edison and MichCon on
straight-line and units-of-production rates approved by the MPSC. The composite depreciation rate
for Detroit Edison was 33% in 2007, 33% in 2006 and 34% in 2005. The composite depreciation
rate for MichCon was 31% in 2007, 28% in 2006 and 32% in 2005. 81 Table of Contents The average estimated useful life for each major class of utility property, plant and equipment as

Non-utility property is depreciated over its estimated useful life using straight-line,
declining-balance or units-of-production methods. The estimated useful lives for major classes of
non-utility assets and facilities ranges from 20 to 40years. The Company credits depreciation, depletion and amortization expense when it establishes regulatory
assets for stranded costs related to the electric Customer Choice program and deferred
environmental expenditures. The Company charges depreciation, depletion and amortization expense
when it amortizes the regulatory assets. The Company credits interest expense to reflect the
accretion income on certain regulatory assets. Intangible assets relating to capitalized software are classified as Property, plant and equipment
and the related amortization is included in Accumulated depreciation and depletion on the
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The Company capitalizes the costs associated with
computer software it develops or obtains for use in its business. The Company amortizes intangible
assets on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, ranging from 3 to 15years.
Intangible assets amortization expense was $42million in 2007, $37million in 2006 and $41million
in 2005. The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets at December
31, 2007 were $493million and $141million, respectively. The gross carrying amount and
accumulated amortization of intangible assets at December31, 2006 were $503million and $108
million, respectively. Amortization expense of intangible assets is estimated to be $45million
annually for 2008 through 2012. Asset Retirement Obligations The Company records asset retirement obligations in accordance with SFAS No143, Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations and FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations,
an interpretation of FASB Statement No143. The Company has a legal retirement obligation for
the decommissioning costs for its Fermi 1 and Fermi 2 nuclear plants. To a lesser extent, the
Company has legal retirement obligations for the synthetic fuel operations, gas production
facilities, gas gathering facilities and various other operations. The Company has conditional
retirement obligations for gas pipeline retirement costs and disposal of asbestos at certain of its
power plants. To a lesser extent, the Company has conditional retirement obligations at certain
service centers, compressor and gate stations, and disposal costs for PCB contained within
transformers and circuit breakers. The Company recognizes such obligations as liabilities at fair
market value at the time the associated assets are placed in service. Fair value is measured using
expected future cash outflows discounted at our credit-adjusted risk-free rate. For the Companys regulated operations, timing differences arise in the expense recognition of
legal asset retirement costs that the Company is currently recovering in rates. The Company defers
such differences under SFAS No71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types
of Regulation.
As a result of adopting FIN 47 on
December 31, 2005, we recorded a plant asset of $26 million with offsetting
accumulated depreciation of $14 million, and an asset retirement obligation
liability of $124 million. We also recorded a cumulative effect amount related
to utility operations as a reduction to a regulatory liability of $108 million
and a cumulative effect charge against earnings of $3 million, after-tax in 2005. No liability has been recorded with respect to lead-based paint, as the quantities of lead-based
paint in the Companys facilities are unknown. In addition, there is no incremental cost to
demolitions of lead-based paint facilities vs. non-lead-based paint facilities and no regulations
currently exist requiring any type of special disposal of items containing lead-based paint. 82 Table of Contents The Ludington Hydroelectric Power Plant a jointly owned plant has an indeterminate life and no
legal obligation currently exists to decommission the plant at some future date. Substations,
manholes and
certain other distribution assets within Detroit Edison have an indeterminate life. Therefore, no
liability has been recorded for these assets. A reconciliation of the asset retirement obligations for 2007 follows

Approximately $11billion of the asset retirement obligations represent nuclear decommissioning
liabilities that are funded through a surcharge to electric customers over the life of the Fermi 2
nuclear plant. Gas Production The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for investments in gas properties.
Under this method of accounting, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and
development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of whether the well has
found proved reserves. If an exploratory well has not found proved reserves, the costs of drilling
the well are expensed. The costs of development wells are capitalized, whether productive or
nonproductive. Geological and geophysical costs on exploratory prospects and the costs of carrying
and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred. An impairment loss is recorded to the
extent that capitalized costs of unproved properties, on a property-by-property basis, are
considered not to be realizable. An impairment loss is recorded if the net capitalized costs of
proved gas properties exceed the aggregate related undiscounted future net revenues. Depreciation,
depletion and amortization of proved gas properties are determined using the units-of-production
method. Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying
amount of the asset exceeds the expected future cash flows generated by the asset, an impairment
loss is recognized resulting in the asset being written down to its estimated fair value. Assets
to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less, cost to
sell. 83 Table of Contents Goodwill The Company has goodwill resulting
from purchase business combinations. The change in the carrying
amount of goodwill for the fiscal years ended December31, 2007

Intangible Assets The Company has certain intangible assets relating to non-utility contracts and emission
allowances. The Company amortizes intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the expected
period of benefit, ranging from 4 to 30years. Intangible assets amortization expense was $2
million in 2007, $5million in 2006 and $2million in 2005. The gross carrying amount and
accumulated amortization of intangible assets at December31, 2007 were $31million and $6million,
respectively. The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets at
December31, 2006 were $80million and $8million, respectively. Net intangible assets reclassified
to Assets held for sale totaled $38million at December31, 2007. Amortization expense of
intangible assets is estimated to be $3million annually for 2008 through 2012. Excise and Sales Taxes The Company records the billing of excise and sales taxes as a receivable with an offsetting
payable to the applicable taxing authority, with no impact on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Deferred Debt Costs The costs related to the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and amortized over the life of
each debt issue. In accordance with MPSC regulations applicable to the Companys electric and gas
utilities, the unamortized discount, premium and expense related to debt redeemed with a
refinancing are amortized over the life of the replacement issue. Discount, premium and expense on
early redemptions of debt associated with non-utility operations are charged to earnings. Insured and Uninsured Risks The Companys comprehensive insurance program provides coverage for various types of risks. The
Companys insurance policies cover risk of loss from property damage, general liability, workers
compensation, auto liability, and directors and officers liability. Under its risk management
policy, the Company self-insures portions of certain risks up to specified limits, depending on the
type of exposure. The Company has an actuarially determined estimate of its incurred but not
reported liability prepared annually and adjusts its reserves for self-insured risks as
appropriate. 84 Table of Contents Investments in Debt and Equity Securities The Company generally classifies investments in debt and equity securities as either trading or
available-for-sale and has recorded such investments at market value with unrealized gains or
losses included in earnings or in other comprehensive income or loss, respectively. Changes in the
fair value of Fermi 2 nuclear decommissioning investments are recorded as adjustments to regulatory
assets or liabilities, due to a recovery mechanism from customers. The Companys investments are
reviewed for impairment each reporting period. If the assessment indicates that the impairment is
other than temporary, a loss is recognized resulting in the investment being written down to its
estimated fair value. See Note 6. Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows A detailed analysis of the changes in assets and liabilities that are reported in the Consolidated

In conjunction with maintaining certain traded risk management positions, the Company may be
required to post cash collateral with its clearing agent; therefore, the Company entered into a
demand financing agreement for up to $150million with its clearing agent in lieu of posting
additional cash collateral a non-cash transaction. The amounts outstanding under this facility
were $13million and $23million at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 85 Table of Contents Other asset gainsand losses, reserves and impairments, net The following items are included in the Other asset gainsand losses, reserves and impairments,

Stock-based Compensation NOTE 2 NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Fair Value Accounting In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No157 defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. It emphasizes that fair value is
a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Fair value measurement should be
determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or
liability. SFAS No157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted SFAS No157 effective January1,
2008. The FASB deferred the effective date of SFAS No157 as it pertains to non-financial assets
and liabilities to January1, 2009. The adoption of SFAS No157 will not have a material impact to
the January1, 2008 balance of retained earnings. In February2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No115. This standard permits an
entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The
fair value option established by SFAS No159 permits all entities to choose to measure eligible
items at fair value at specified election dates. An entity will report in earnings unrealized gains
and losses on items, for which the fair value option has been elected, at each subsequent reporting
date. The fair value option: amay be applied instrument by instrument, with a few exceptions,
such as investments otherwise accounted for by the equity method; bis irrevocable unless a new
election date occurs; and cis applied only to 86 Table of Contents entire instruments and not to portions of
instruments. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that
begins after November15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No159 is not expected to have a material
impact to the Companys financial statements. At January1, 2008, the Company has not elected to
use the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities held at that date. Offsetting Amounts Related to Certain Contracts In April2007, the FASB issued FSP FIN 39-1, Amendment of FASB Interpretation No39. This standard
will permit the Company to offset the fair value of derivative instruments with cash collateral
received or paid for those derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a
master netting arrangement. As a result, the Company will be permitted to record one net asset or
liability that represents the total net exposure of all derivative positions under a master netting
arrangement. The decision to offset derivative positions under master netting arrangements remains
an accounting policy choice. The Company presently records the net fair value of derivative assets
and liabilities for those contracts held by Energy Trading that are subject to master netting
arrangements, and separately records amounts for cash collateral received or paid for these
instruments. Under this standard, if the Company chooses to offset the collateral amounts against
the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities, both the Companys total assets and total
liabilities could be reduced. The guidance in this FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning
after November15, 2007, with early application permitted. The FSP is to be applied retrospectively
by adjusting the financial statements for all periods presented. The company adopted the FSP as of
January1, 2008.
Business Combinations In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141R, Business Combinations. The objective of this
Statement is to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the
information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination
and its effects. To accomplish that, this Statement establishes principles and requirements for how
the acquirer   
Recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired,
the
liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the
acquiree   
Recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from
a
bargain purchase; and   
Determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to
evaluate
the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No141R shall be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition
date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after
December15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company is currently assessing the effects
of this statement, and has not yet determined its impact on its consolidated financial statements. Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements an Amendment of ARB No51. The standard requires   
The ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly
identified, labeled, and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position
within equity, but separate from the parents equity   
The amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the
noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated
statement of income   
Changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling
financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for as equity transactions 87 Table of Contents   
When a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in
the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value. The gain or loss on the
deconsolidation of the subsidiary is measured using the fair value of any noncontrolling
equity investment rather than the carrying amount of that retained investment; and   
Entities provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between
the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning on or after December15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. This Statement shall be
applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this Statement is initially
applied, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements. The presentation and disclosure
requirements shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. The Company is currently
assessing the effects of this statement, and has not yet determined its impact on its consolidated
financial statements. NOTE 3 DISPOSALS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Sale of Antrim Shale Gas Exploration and Production Business In 2007, the Company sold its Antrim shale gas exploration and production business Antrim for
gross proceeds of $1262billion. The pre-tax gain recognized on this sale amounted to $900million
$580million after-tax and is reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations under the
line item, Gain on sale of non-utility business, and included in the Corporate Other segment.
Prior to the sale, the operating results of Antrim were reflected in the Unconventional Gas
Production segment. The Antrim business is not presented as a discontinued operation due to continuation of cash flows
related to the sale of a portion of Antrims natural gas production to Energy Trading under the
terms of natural gas sales contracts that expire in 2010 and 2012. These continuing cash flows,
while not significant to DTE Energy, are significant to Antrim and therefore meet the definition of
continuing cash flows as described in EITF 03-13, Applying the Conditions in Paragraph42 of FASB
Statement No144 in Determining Whether to Report Discontinued Operations.
Prior to the sale, a substantial portion of the Companys price risk related to expected gas
production from its Antrim shale business had been hedged through 2013. These financial contracts
were accounted for as cash flow hedges, with changes in estimated fair value of the contracts
reflected in other comprehensive income. Upon the sale of Antrim, the financial contracts no longer
qualified as cash flow hedges. The contracts were retained and assigned to Energy Trading, and
offsetting financial contracts were put into place to effectively settle these positions. As a
result of these transactions and market research performed by the Company, we gained additional
insight and visibility into the value ascribed to these contracts by third party market
participants, including contract periods that extend beyond the actively traded period. In
conjunction with the Antrim sale and effective settlement of these
contract positions, the Company reclassified amounts held in accumulated other comprehensive income and recorded the effective
settlements, reducing operating revenues in 2007 by $323million. Plan to Sell Interest in Certain Power and Industrial Projects The Company expects to sell a 50percent interest in a portfolio of select Power and Industrial
Projects Projects. In addition to the proceeds that the Company will receive from the sale of the
50percent equity interest, the company that will own the Projects will obtain debt financing and
the proceeds will be distributed to DTE Energy immediately prior to the sale of the equity
interest. The Company expects to complete the transaction in the first half of 2008. This timing,
however, is highly dependent on availability of acceptable financing terms in the credit markets.
As a result, the Company cannot predict the timing with certainty. The Company expects to recognize
a gain upon completion of the transaction. In conjunction with the sale, the Company will enter
into a management services agreement to manage the day-to-day operations of the Projects and to act
as the managing member of the company that owns the Projects. We 88 Table of Contents plan to account for our 50percent
ownership interest in the company that will own the portfolio of projects using the equity method.
The Projects are contained in the Power and Industrial Projects segment and were classified as held
for sale in September2007. The earnings pertaining to the Projects are fully consolidated in the Companys Consolidated
Statements of Operations. The following table presents the major classes of assets and liabilities

The table above represents 100percent of the applicable assets and liabilities that are held for
sale as of December31, 2007. At September30, 2007, the assets were classified as held for sale
and we ceased recording depreciation and amortization expense related to these assets. Subsequent
to the expected sale of the 50percent interest, the remaining 50percent interest in the Projects
will be reflected in the Companys financial statements under the equity method of accounting. The
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position includes $28million of minority interests in
projects classified as held for sale. The results of the Projects will not be presented as
discontinued operations, as the Company expects to retain a 50percent ownership interest which
represents significant continuing involvement as described in SFAS No144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.
Sale of Interest in Barnett Shale Properties On January15, 2008, the Company sold a portion of its Barnett shale properties for gross proceeds
of approximately $250million, subject to post-closing adjustments. The properties in the sale
include 186billion cubic feet of proved and probable reserves on 11,000 net acres in the core area
of the Barnett shale. As of December31, 2007, property, plant and equipment of approximately $122
million, net of approximately $14million of accumulated depreciation and depletion, was classified
as held for sale. The Company expects to recognize a gain upon
completion of the transaction.
89 Table of Contents Synthetic Fuel Business The Company discontinued the operations of our synthetic fuel production facilities throughout the
United States as of December31, 2007. Synfuel plants chemically changed coal and waste coal into a
synthetic fuel as determined under the Internal Revenue Code. Production tax credits were provided
for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel produced from coal and were available through
December31, 2007. Through December31, 2007, the Company has generated and recorded approximately
$601million in production tax credits. The Company had sold interests in all of the synthetic fuel production plants, representing
approximately 91% of its total production capacity. Proceeds from the sales are contingent upon
production levels, the production qualifying for production tax credits, and the value of such
credits. Production tax credits are subject to phase-out if domestic crude oil prices reach
certain levels. The Company recognizes gains from the sale of interests in the synfuel facilities
as synfuel is produced and sold, and when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds have
become fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. The Company has provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction with the sales of
interests in its synfuel facilities. The guarantees cover potential commercial, environmental, oil
price and tax-related obligations and will survive until 90days after expiration of all applicable
statutes of limitations. The Company estimates that its maximum potential liability under these
guarantees at December31, 2007 is $31billion. At December31, 2007, the Company has reserved
$436million of its maximum potential liability, primarily representing the estimated refund of
certain payments made by its synfuel partners. As shown in the following table, the Company has reported the business activity of the Synthetic
Fuel business as a discontinued operation. The amounts exclude general corporate overhead costs

Includes intercompany pre-tax gain of $32million $21million after-tax for 2007. Crete In July2007, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its 50percent equity interest in
Crete, a 320 MW natural gas-fired peaking electric generating plant. The sale closed in October
2007 resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $37million, which resulted in a gain of $8
million, $5million after- tax. See Note 4 for information regarding a 2006 impairment related
to Crete. 90 Table of Contents DTE Georgetown Georgetown Georgetown is an 80 MW natural gas-fired peaking electric generating plant. In December2006,
Georgetown met the SFAS No144 criteria of an asset held for sale and the Company reported its
operating results as a discontinued operation. In February2007, the Company entered into an
agreement to sell this plant. The sale closed in July2007 resulting in gross proceeds of
approximately $23million, which approximated its carrying value. As shown in the following table, the Company has reported the business activity of Georgetown as a
discontinued operation. The amounts exclude general corporate overhead costs

Includes intercompany revenues of $1million for 2006 and 2005. DTE Energy Technologies Dtech Dtech assembled, marketed, distributed and serviced distributed generation products, provided
application engineering, and monitored and managed on-site generation system operations. In the
third quarter of 2005, management approved the restructuring of this business resulting in the
identification of certain assets and liabilities to be sold or abandoned, primarily associated with
standby and continuous duty generation sales and service. The systems monitoring business is
planned to be retained by the Company. The Dtech restructuring plan met the SFAS No144 criteria
of an asset held for sale and the Company reported its operating results as a discontinued
operation. The Company expects continued legal and warranty expenses in 2008 related to Dtechs
operations prior to the third quarter of 2005. As of December31, 2007, Dtech had liabilities of
approximately $1million. As shown in the following table, the Company has reported the business activity of Dtech as a
discontinued operation. The amounts exclude general corporate overhead costs and operations that
are to be retained.

million related to the write-off of the costs of unproved properties and expired leases in Bosque
County, which is located in the southern expansion area of the Barnett shale in north Texas. The
properties were impaired due to the lack of economic and operating viability of the project. The
impairment loss was recorded within the Other asset gainsand losses, reserves, and impairments,
net line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Landfill Gas Recovery In 2006, the Companys Power and Industrial Projects segment recorded a pre-tax impairment loss of
$14million at its landfill gas recovery unit relating to the write down of assets at several
landfill sites. The fixed assets were impaired due to continued operating losses and the oil
price-related phase-out of
production tax credits. The impairment was recorded within the Other asset gainsand losses,
reserves and impairments, net line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company
calculated the expected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the
assets, which indicated that the carrying amount of certain assets was not recoverable. The
Company determined the fair value of the assets utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Non-Utility Power Generation In 2006, the Power and Industrial Projects segment recorded a pre-tax impairment loss totaling $74
million for its investments in two natural gas-fired electric generating plants. A loss of $42million related to a 100% owned plant is recorded within the Other asset gainsand
losses, reserves and impairments, net line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The
generating plant was impaired due to continued operating losses and the September2006 delisting by
MISO, resulting in the plant no longer providing capacity for the power grid. The Company
calculated the expected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the plant,
which indicated that the carrying amount of the plant was not recoverable. The Company determined
the fair value of the plant utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. A loss of
$32 million related to a 50% equity interest in Crete is recorded within the Other
incomeand deductions, Other expenses line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2006.
The investment was impaired due to continued operating losses and the expected sale of the
investment. The Company determined the fair value of the plant utilizing a discounted cash flow
technique, which indicated that the carrying amount of the investment exceeded its fair value. Waste Coal Recovery In 2006, our Power and Industrial Projects segment recorded a pre-tax impairment loss of $19
million related to its investment in proprietary technology used to refine waste coal. The fixed
assets at our development operation were impaired due to continued operating losses and negative
cash flow. In addition, the Company impaired all of its patents related to waste coal technology.
The Company calculated the expected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition
of the assets, which indicated that the carrying amount of the assets was not recoverable. The
Company determined the fair value of the assets utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. The
impairment loss was recorded within the Other asset gainsand losses, reserves and impairments,
net line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 92 Table of Contents Restructuring Performance Excellence Process In mid-2005, the Company initiated a company-wide review of its operations called the Performance
Excellence Process. Specifically, the Company began a series of focused improvement initiatives
within Detroit Edison and MichCon, and associated corporate support functions. The Company expects
this process to continue into 2008. The Company incurred CTA for employee severance and other costs. Other costs include project
management and consultant support. Pursuant to MPSC authorization, beginning in the third quarter
of 2006, Detroit Edison deferred approximately $102million of CTA in 2006. Detroit Edison began
amortizing deferred 2006 costs in 2007 as the recovery of these costs was provided for by the MPSC.
Amortization expense amounted to $10million in 2007. Detroit
Edison deferred $54 million of CTA during 2007. MichCon cannot defer CTA costs at this time because a recovery
mechanism has not been established. MichCon expects to seek a recovery mechanism in its next rate
case in 2009. See
Note 5. Amounts expensed are recorded in the Operation and maintenance line on the Consolidated Statements
of Operations. Deferred amounts are recorded in the Regulatory asset line on the Consolidated
Statements of Financial Position. Costs incurred in 2007 and 2006 are as follows

A liability for future CTA associated with the Performance Excellence Process has not been
recognized because the Company has not met the recognition criteria of SFAS No146, Accounting for
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. NOTE 5 REGULATORY MATTERS Regulation Detroit Edison and MichCon are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the MPSC, which issues
orders pertaining to rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of generating facilities
and regulatory assets, conditions of service, accounting and operating-related matters. Detroit
Edison is also regulated by the FERC with respect to financing authorization and wholesale electric
activities. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities Detroit Edison and MichCon apply the provisions of SFAS No71, Accounting for the Effects of
Certain Types of Regulation, to their regulated operations. SFAS No71 requires the recording of
regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue
and expense in non-regulated businesses. Continued applicability of SFAS No71 requires that rates
be designed to recover specific costs of providing regulated services and be charged to and
collected from customers. Future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment
could result in the Company discontinuing the application of SFAS No71 for some or all of its
utility businesses and may require the write-off of 93 Table of Contents the portion of any regulatory asset or
liability that was no longer probable of recovery through regulated rates. Management believes that
currently available facts support the continued application of SFAS No71 to Detroit Edison and
MichCon. The following are balances and a brief description of the regulatory assets and liabilities at

ASSETS   
Securitized regulatory assets The net book balance of the Fermi 2 nuclear plant was
written off in 1998 and an equivalent regulatory asset was established. In 2001, the Fermi 2
regulatory asset and certain other regulatory assets were securitized pursuant to PA 142 and
an MPSC order. A non-bypassable securitization bond surcharge recovers the securitized
regulatory asset over a fourteen-year period ending in 2015.   
Recoverable income taxes related to securitized regulatory assets Receivable for the
recovery of income taxes to be paid on the non-bypassable securitization bond surcharge. A
non-bypassable securitization tax surcharge recovers the income tax over a fourteen-year
period ending 2015.   
Recoverable pension and postretirement costs The traditional rate setting process allows
for the recovery of pension and postretirement costs as measured by generally accepted
accounting principles. 94 Table of Contents   
Asset retirement obligation Asset retirement obligations were recorded pursuant to
adoption of SFAS No143 and FIN 47. These obligations are primarily for Fermi 2
decommissioning costs that are recovered in rates.   
Other recoverable income taxes Income taxes receivable from Detroit Edisons customers
representing the difference in property-related deferred income taxes receivable and amounts
previously reflected in Detroit Edisons rates.   
Excess capital expenditures PA 141 permits, after MPSC authorization, the recovery of
and a return on capital expenditures that exceed a base level of depreciation expense.   
Deferred Clean Air Act expenditures PA 141 permits, after MPSC authorization, the
recovery of and a return on Clean Air Act expenditures.   
Midwest Independent System Operator charges PA 141 permits, after MPSC authorization,
the recovery of and a return on charges from a regional transmission operator such as the
Midwest Independent System Operator.   
Electric Customer Choice implementation costs PA 141 permits, after MPSC authorization,
the recovery of and a return on costs incurred associated with the implementation of the
electric Customer Choice program.   
Enhanced security costs PA 609 of 2002 permits, after MPSC authorization, the recovery
of enhanced security costs for an electric generating facility.   
Unamortized loss on reacquired debt The unamortized discount, premium and expense
related to debt redeemed with a refinancing are deferred, amortized and recovered over the
life of the replacement issue.   
Deferred environmental costs The MPSC approved the deferral and recovery of
investigation and remediation costs associated with Gas Utilitys former MGP sites.   
Accrued PSCR revenue Receivable for the temporary under-recovery of and a return on fuel
and purchased power costs incurred by Detroit Edison which are recoverable through the PSCR
mechanism.   
Accrued GCR revenue Receivable for the temporary under-recovery of and a return on gas
costs incurred by MichCon which are recoverable through the GCR mechanism.   
Recoverable uncollectibles expense MichCon receivable for the MPSC approved
uncollectible expense true-up mechanism that tracks the difference in the fluctuation in
uncollectible accounts and amounts recognized pursuant to the MPSC authorization.   
Cost to achieve Performance Excellence Process PEP The MPSC authorized the deferral of
costs to implement the PEP. These costs consist of employee severance, project management and
consultant support. These costs will be amortized over a ten-year period beginning with the
year subsequent to the year the costs were deferred.   
Enterprise Business Systems EBScosts Starting in 2006, the MPSC approved the deferral
of up to $60million of certain EBS costs that would otherwise be expensed.   
Deferred income taxes Michigan Business Tax MBT
- In July2007, the MBT was enacted by
the State of Michigan. State deferred tax liabilities were established for the Companys
utilities, and offsetting regulatory assets were recorded as the impacts of the deferred tax
liabilities will be reflected in rates. LIABILITIES

Deferred income taxes Michigan Business Tax 
In July2007, the MBT was enacted by the
State of Michigan. State deferred tax assets were established for the Companys utilities, and
offsetting regulatory liabilities were recorded as the impacts of the deferred tax assets will
be reflected in rates. MPSC Show Cause Order
In March2006, the MPSC issued an order directing Detroit Edison to show cause by June1, 2006 why
its rates should not be reduced in 2007. Detroit Edison filed its response explaining why its rates
should not be reduced in 2007. The MPSC issued an order approving a settlement agreement in this
proceeding on August31, 2006. The order provided for an annualized rate reduction of $53million
for 2006, effective September5, 2006. Beginning January1, 2007, and continuing until April13,
2008, one year from the filing of the general rate case on April13, 2007, rates were reduced by an
additional $26million, for a total reduction of $79million annually. The revenue reduction is net
of the recovery of the amortization of the costs associated with the implementation of the
Performance Excellence Process. The settlement agreement provided for some level of realignment of
the existing rate structure by allocating a larger percentage share of the rate reduction to the
commercial and industrial customer classes than to the residential customer classes. As part of the settlement agreement, a Choice Incentive Mechanism CIMwas established with a base
level of electric choice sales set at 3,400 GWh. The CIM prescribes regulatory treatment of changes
in non-fuel revenue attributed to increases or decreases in electric Customer Choice sales. If
electric Customer Choice sales exceed 3,600 GWh, Detroit Edison will be able to recover 90percent
of its reduction in non-fuel revenue from full service customers up to $71million. If electric
Customer Choice sales fall below 3,200 GWh, Detroit Edison will credit 100percent of the increase
in non-fuel revenue to the unrecovered regulatory asset balance. Approximately $28million was
credited to the unrecovered regulatory asset in 2007. 2007 Electric Rate Case Filing Pursuant to the February2006 MPSC order in Detroit Edisons rate restructuring case and the August
2006 MPSC order in the settlement of the show cause case, Detroit Edison filed a general rate case
on April13, 2007 based on a 2006 historical test year. The filing with the MPSC requested a $123
million, or 29percent, average increase in Detroit Edisons annual revenue requirement for 2008. The requested $123million increase in revenues is required in order to recover significant
environmental compliance costs and inflationary increases, partially offset by net savings
associated with the Performance Excellence Process. The filing was based on a return on equity of
1125percent on an expected 50percent equity capital and 50percent debt capital structure by
year-end 2008. In addition, Detroit Edisons filing makes, among other requests, the following proposals   
Make progress toward correcting the existing rate structure to more accurately reflect
the actual cost of providing service to customers.   
Equalize distribution rates between Detroit Edison full service and electric Customer
Choice customers. 96 Table of Contents   
Re-establish with modification the CIM originally established in the Detroit Edison
2006 show cause filing. The CIM reconciles changes related to customers moving between
Detroit Edison full service and electric Customer Choice.   
Terminate the Pension Equalization Mechanism.   
Establish an emission allowance pre-purchase plan to ensure that adequate emission
allowances will be available for environmental compliance.   
Establish a methodology for recovery of the costs associated with preparation of an
application for a new nuclear generation facility. Also, in the filing, in conjunction with Michigans 21st Century Energy Plan, Detroit Edison has
reinstated a long-term integrated resource planning IRPprocess with the purpose of developing
the least overall cost plan to serve customers generation needs over the next 20years. Based on
the IRP, new base load capacity may be required for Detroit Edison. To protect tax credits
available under Federal law, Detroit Edison
determined it would be prudent to initiate the application process for a new nuclear unit. Detroit
Edison has not made a final decision to build a new nuclear unit. Detroit Edison is preserving its
option to build at some point in the future by beginning the complex nuclear licensing process in
2007. Also, beginning the licensing process at the present time positions Detroit Edison,
potentially, to take advantage of tax incentives of up to $320million derived from provisions in
the 2005 Federal Energy Policy Act that will benefit customers. To qualify for these substantial
tax credits, a combined operating license application for construction and operation of an advanced
nuclear generating plant must be docketed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission no later than
December31, 2008. Preparation and approval of a combined operating license can take up to 4years
and is estimated to cost at least $60million. At December31, 2007, costs related to preparing the
combined licensing application totaling $10million have been deferred and included in Other
assets. On August31, 2007, Detroit Edison filed a supplement to its April2007 rate case filing. A July
2007 decision by the Court of Appeals of the State of Michigan remanded back to the MPSC the
November2004 order in a prior Detroit Edison rate case that denied recovery of merger control
premium costs. The supplemental filing addressed recovery of approximately $61million related to
the merger control premium. The filing also included the impact of the July2007 enactment of the
MBT, and other adjustments. The net impact of the supplemental changes results in an additional
revenue requirement of approximately $76million average
increase in Detroit Edisons annual revenue requirement for 2008. On February20, 2008, Detroit Edison filed an update to its April2007 rate case filing. The
update reflects the use of 2009 as the projected test year and includes a revised 2009 load
forecast, and 2009 estimates on environmental and advanced metering infrastructure capital
expenditures, and adjustments to the calculation of the MBT. In addition the update also includes
the August2007 supplemental filing adjustments for the merger control premium, the new MBT, and
environmental operating and maintenance adjustments. The net impact of the updated filing results
in an additional revenue requirement of approximately $85million average increase in Detroit Edisons annual revenue requirement for 2009. The total filing
requests a $284million increase in Detroit Edisons annual revenue for 2009. An MPSC order
related to this filing is expected in 2009. Regulatory Accounting Treatment for Performance Excellence Process In May2006, Detroit Edison and MichCon filed applications with the MPSC to allow deferral of costs
associated with the implementation of the Performance Excellence Process, a company-wide
cost-savings and performance improvement program. Detroit Edison and MichCon sought MPSC
authorization to defer and amortize Performance Excellence Process implementation costs for
accounting purposes to match the expected savings from the Performance Excellence Process program
with the related CTA. 97 Table of Contents Detroit Edison and MichCon anticipate the Performance Excellence Process to
continue into 2008. In September2006, the MPSC issued an order approving a settlement agreement
that allows Detroit Edison and MichCon, commencing in 2006, to defer the incremental CTA, subject
to the MPSC establishing a recovery mechanism in a future rate proceeding. Further, the order
provides for Detroit Edison and MichCon to amortize the CTA deferrals over a ten-year period
beginning with the year subsequent to the year the CTA was deferred. At year-end 2006, Detroit
Edison recorded deferred CTA costs of $102million as a regulatory asset and began amortizing
deferred 2006 costs in 2007, as the recovery of these costs was provided for by the MPSC in its
order approving the settlement of the show cause proceeding. During 2007, Detroit Edison deferred
CTA costs of $54million. Amortization of prior year deferred CTA costs amounted to $10million
during 2007. MichCon cannot defer CTA costs at this time because a recovery mechanism has not been
established. MichCon expects to seek a recovery mechanism in its next rate case. Accounting for Costs Related to Enterprise Business Systems EBS In July2004, Detroit Edison filed an accounting application with the MPSC requesting authority to
capitalize and amortize costs related to EBS, consisting of computer equipment, software and
development costs, as well as related training, maintenance and overhead costs. In April2005, the
MPSC approved a settlement agreement providing for the deferral of up to $60million of certain EBS
costs,
which would otherwise be expensed, as a regulatory asset for future rate recovery starting January
1, 2006. At December31, 2007, approximately $26million of EBS costs have been deferred as a
regulatory asset. In addition, EBS costs recorded as plant assets will be amortized over a 15-year
period, pursuant to MPSC authorization. Fermi 2 Enhanced Security Costs Settlement The Customer Choice and Electricity Reliability Act, as amended in 2003, allows for the recovery of
reasonable and prudent costs of new and enhanced security measures required by state or federal
law, including providing for reasonable security from an act of terrorism. In December2006,
Detroit Edison filed an application with the MPSC for recovery of $114million of Fermi 2 Enhanced
Security Costs ESC, discounted back to September11, 2001 plus carrying costs from that date. In
April2007, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement that authorizes Detroit Edison to recover
Fermi 2 ESC incurred during the period of September11, 2001 through December31, 2005. The
settlement defined Detroit Edisons ESC, discounted back to September11, 2001, as $91million,
plus carrying charges. A total of $13million, including carrying charges, has been deferred as a
regulatory asset. Detroit Edison is authorized to incorporate into its rates an enhanced security
factor over a period not to exceed five years. Amortization of this regulatory asset was
approximately $3million in 2007. Reconciliation of Regulatory Asset Recovery Surcharge In December2006, Detroit Edison filed a reconciliation of costs underlying its existing Regulatory
Asset Recovery Surcharge RARS. This true-up filing was made to maximize the remaining time for
recovery of significant cost increases prior to expiration of the RARS five-year recovery limit
under PA 141. Detroit Edison requested a reconciliation of the regulatory asset surcharge to ensure
proper recovery by the end of the five year period of: 1Clean Air Act Expenditures, 2Capital
in Excess of Base Depreciation, 3MISO Costs and 4the regulatory liability for the 1997 Storm
Charge. In July2007, the MPSC approved a negotiated RARS deficiency settlement that resulted in a
$10million write down of RARS-related costs in 2007. As previously discussed above, the CIM in
the MPSC Show-Cause Order will reduce the regulatory asset. Approximately $28million was credited
to the unrecovered regulatory asset in 2007 due to the CIM. 98 Table of Contents Power Supply Costs Recovery Proceedings 2005 Plan Year  In March2006, Detroit Edison filed its 2005 PSCR reconciliation that sought
approval for recovery of an under-recovery of approximately $144million at December31, 2005 from
its commercial and industrial customers. The filing included a motion for entry of an order to
implement immediately a reconciliation surcharge of 496 mills per kWh on the bills of its
commercial and industrial customers. The under-collected PSCR expense allocated to residential
customers could not be recovered due to the PA 141 rate cap for residential customers, which
expired January1, 2006. In addition to the 2005 PSCR plan year reconciliation, the filing included
a reconciliation for the Pension Equalization Mechanism PEMfor the periods from November24,
2004 through December31, 2004 and from January1, 2005 through December31, 2005. The PEM
reconciliation seeks to allocate and refund approximately $12million to customers based upon their
contributions to pension expense during the subject periods. In September2006, the MPSC ordered
the Company to roll the entire 2004 PSCR over-collection amount to the Companys 2005 PSCR
Reconciliation. An order was issued on May22, 2007 approving a 2005 PSCR undercollection amount of
$94million and the recovery of this amount through a surcharge for 12months beginning in June
2007. In addition, the order approved Detroit Edisons proposed PEM reconciliation that was
refunded to customers on a bills-rendered basis during June2007. 2006 Plan Year In September2005, Detroit Edison filed its 2006 PSCR plan case seeking approval
of a levelized PSCR factor of 499 mills per kWh above the amount included in base rates for
residential customers and 829 mills per kWh above the amount included in base rates for commercial
and industrial customers. Included in the factor for all customers are fuel and power supply costs,
including transmission expenses, Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator MISOmarket
participation
costs, and NOx emission allowance costs. The Companys PSCR Plan included a matrix which provided
for different maximum PSCR factors contingent on varying electric Customer Choice sales levels. The
plan also included $97million for recovery of its projected 2005 PSCR under-collection associated
with commercial and industrial customers. Additionally, the PSCR plan requested MPSC approval of
expense associated with sulfur dioxide emission allowances, mercury emission allowances, and a fuel
additive. In conjunction with DTE Energys sale of its transmission assets to ITC Transmission in
February2003, the FERC froze ITC Transmissions rates through December2004. In approving the
sale, FERC authorized ITC Transmissions recovery of the difference between the revenue it would
have collected and the actual revenue collected during the rate freeze period. This amount is
estimated to be $66million which is to be included in ITC Transmissions rates over a five-year
period beginning June1, 2006. This increased Detroit Edisons transmission expense in 2006 by
approximately $7million. The MPSC authorized Detroit Edison in 2004 to recover transmission
expenses through the PSCR mechanism. In December2005, the MPSC issued a temporary order authorizing the Company to begin implementation
of maximum quarterly PSCR factors on January1, 2006. The quarterly factors reflect a downward
adjustment in the Companys total power supply costs of approximately 2percent to reflect the
potential variability in cost projections. The quarterly factors allowed the Company to more
closely track the costs of providing electric service to our customers and, because the non-summer
factors are well below those ordered for the summer months, effectively delay the higher power
supply costs to the summer months at which time our customers will not be experiencing large
expenditures for home heating. The MPSC did not adopt the Companys request to recover its
projected 2005 PSCR under-collection associated with commercial and industrial customers nor did it
adopt the Companys request to implement contingency factors based upon the Companys increased
costs associated with providing electric service to returning electric Customer Choice customers.
The MPSC deferred both of those Company proposals to the final order on the Companys entire 2006
PSCR plan. In September2006, the MPSC issued an order in this case that approved the inclusion of
sulfur dioxide emission allowance expense in the PSCR, determined that fuel additive expense should
not be included in the PSCR based upon its impact on maintenance expense, found the Companys
determination of third party sales revenues to be correct, and allowed the Company to increase its
PSCR factor for the balance of the year in an effort to reverse the effects of the previously
ordered temporary reduction. The MPSC declined to rule on the Companys requests to include mercury
emission allowance expense in the PSCR or its request to include prior PSCR over/under recoveries
in future year PSCR plans. The Company filed its 2006 PSCR reconciliation case in March2007. The
$51million PSCR under-collection amount reflected in that 99 Table of Contents filing is being collected in the 2007
PSCR plan. Included in the 2006 PSCR reconciliation filing was the Companys 2006 PEM
reconciliation that reflects a $21million ovecollection which is subject to refund to customers.
An MPSC order in this case is expected in 2008. 2007 Plan Year In September2006, Detroit Edison filed its 2007 PSCR plan case seeking approval
of a levelized PSCR factor of 698 mills per kWh above the amount included in base rates for all
PSCR customers. The Companys PSCR plan filing included $130million for the recovery of its
projected 2006 PSCR under-collection, bringing the total requested PSCR factor to 973 mills/kWh.
The Companys application included a request for an early hearing and temporary order granting such
ratemaking authority. The Companys 2007 PSCR plan includes fuel and power supply costs, including
NOx and SO2
emission allowance costs, transmission costs and MISO costs. The Company
filed supplemental testimony and briefs in December2006 supporting its updated request to include
approximately $81million for the recovery of its projected 2006 PSCR under-collection. The MPSC
issued a temporary order in December2006 approving the Companys request. In addition, Detroit
Edison was granted the authority to include all PSCR over/under collections in future PSCR plans,
thereby reducing the time between refund or recovery of PSCR reconciliation amounts. The Company
began to collect its 2007 power supply costs, including the 2006 rollover amount, through a PSCR
factor of 869 mills/kWh on January1, 2007. The Company reduced the PSCR factor to 669 mills/kWh
on July1, 2007 based on the updated 2007 PSCR plan year projections. In August2007, the MPSC
approved Detroit Edisons 2007 PSCR case and authorized the Company to charge a maximum power
supply cost recovery factor of 869 mills/kWh in 2007. 2008 Plan Year In September2007, Detroit Edison filed its 2008 PSCR plan case seeking approval
of a levelized PSCR factor of 923 mills/kWh above the amount included in base rates for all PSCR
customers. The Company is supporting a total 2008 power supply expense forecast of $13billion
that includes $1million for the recovery of its projected 2007
PSCR under-collection. The
Companys PSCR Plan will allow the Company to recover its reasonably and prudently incurred power
supply expense including; fuel costs, purchased and net interchange power costs, NOx and
SO2 emission allowance costs, transmission costs and MISO costs. Also included in the
filing is a request for approval of the Companys emission compliance strategy which includes
pre-purchases of emission allowances as well as a request for pre-approval of a contract for
capacity and energy associated with a renewable wind energy project. On January31, 2008, Detroit
Edison filed a revised PSCR plan case seeking approval of a levelized PSCR factor of 1122
mills/kWh above the amount included in base rates for all PSCR customers. The revised filing
supports a 2008 power supply expense forecast of $14billion and includes $43million for the
recovery of a projected 2007 PSCR under-collection.
Uncollectible Expense True-Up Mechanism UETMand Report of Safety and Training-Related
Expenditures 2005 UETM In March2006, MichCon filed an application with the MPSC for approval of its UETM for
2005. This is the first filing MichCon has made under the UETM, which was approved by the MPSC in
April2005 as part of MichCons last general rate case. MichCons 2005 base rates included $37
million for anticipated uncollectible expenses. Actual 2005 uncollectible expenses totaled $60
million. The true-up mechanism allows MichCon to recover ninety percent of uncollectibles that
exceeded the $37million base. Under the formula prescribed by the MPSC, MichCon recorded an
under-recovery of approximately $11million for uncollectible expenses from May2005 when the
mechanism took effect through the end of 2005. In December2006, the MPSC issued an order
authorizing MichCon to implement the UETM monthly surcharge for service rendered on and after
January1, 2007. As part of the March2006 application with the MPSC, MichCon filed a review of its 2005 annual
safety and training-related expenditures. MichCon reported that actual safety and training-related
expenditures for the initial period exceeded the pro-rata amounts included in base rates and based
on the under-recovered position, recommended no refund at this time. In the December2006 order,
the MPSC also approved MichCons 2005 safety and training report. 100 Table of Contents 2006 UETM In March2007, MichCon filed an application with the MPSC for approval of its UETM for
2006 requesting $33million of under-recovery plus applicable carrying costs of $3million. The
March2007 application included a report of MichCons 2006 annual safety and training-related
expenditures, which shows a $2million over-recovery. In August2007, MichCon filed revised
exhibits reflecting an agreement with the MPSC Staff to net the $2million over-recovery and
associated interest related to the 2006 safety and training-related expenditures against the 2006
UETM under-recovery. An MPSC order was issued in December2007 approving the collection of $33
million requested in the August2007 revised filing. MichCon is authorized to implement the new
UETM monthly surcharge for service rendered on and after January1, 2008. Gas Cost Recovery Proceedings 2005-2006 Plan Year In June2006, MichCon filed its GCR reconciliation for the 2005-2006 GCR
year. The filing supported a total over-recovery, including interest through March2006, of $13
million. MPSC Staff and other interveners filed testimony regarding the reconciliation in which
they recommended disallowances related to MichCons implementation of its dollar cost averaging
fixed price program. In January2007, MichCon filed testimony rebutting these recommendations. On
December18, 2007, the MPSC issued an order adopting the adjustments proposed by the MPSC Staff
resulting in an $8million disallowance. Expense related to the disallowance was reflected in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December31, 2007. The MPSC authorized
MichCon to roll a net over-recovery, inclusive of interest, of $20million into its 2006-2007 GCR
reconciliation. On December27, 2007, MichCon filed an appeal of the case with the Michigan Court
of Appeals. MichCon is unable to predict the outcome of the appeal. 2006-2007 Plan Year In June2007, MichCon filed its GCR reconciliation for the 2006-2007 GCR
year. The filing supported a total under-recovery, including interest through March2007, of $18
million. An MPSC order in this case is expected in 2008. 2007-2008 Plan Year / Base Gas Sale Consolidated In August2006, MichCon filed an application
with the MPSC requesting permission to sell base gas that would become accessible with storage
facilities upgrades. In December2006, MichCon filed its 2007-2008 GCR plan case proposing a
maximum GCR factor of $849 per Mcf. In August2007, a settlement agreement in this proceeding was
reached by all intervening parties that provides for a sharing with customers of the proceeds from
the sale of base gas. In addition, the agreement provides for a rate case filing moratorium until
January1, 2009, unless certain unanticipated changes occur that impact income by more than $5
million. The settlement agreement was approved by the MPSC on August21, 2007. MichCons gas
storage enhancement projects, the main subject of the aforementioned settlement, will enable 17
billion cubic feet Bcf of gas to become available for cycling. Under the settlement terms,
MichCon delivered 134 Bcf of this gas to its customers through 2007 at a savings to market-priced
supplies of approximately $54million. This settlement provides for MichCon to retain the proceeds
from the sale of 36 Bcf of gas, which MichCon expects to sell in 2007 through 2009. In the fourth
quarter of 2007, MichCon sold 75 Bcf of base gas and recognized a pre-tax gain of $5million. By
enabling MichCon to retain the profit from the sale of this gas, the settlement provides MichCon
with the opportunity to earn an 11% return on equity with no customer rate increase for a period of
five years from 2005 to 2010. 2008-2009 Plan Year In December2007, MichCon filed its GCR plan case for the 2008-2009 GCR Plan
year. MichCon filed for a maximum GCR factor of $836 per Mcf. An order in this case is expected
during 2008. Other On July3, 2007, the Court of Appeals of the State of Michigan published its decision with respect
to an 101 Table of Contents appeal by Detroit Edison and others of certain provisions of a November23, 2004 MPSC order,
including reversing the MPSCs denial of recovery of merger control premium costs. In its
published decision, the Court of Appeals held that Detroit Edison is entitled to recover its
allocated share of the merger control premium and remanded this matter to the MPSC for further
proceedings to establish the precise amount and timing of this recovery. Detroit Edison has filed
a supplement to its April2007 rate case to address the recovery of the merger control premium
costs. Other parties have filed requests for leave to appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court from
the Court of Appeals decision. On September6, 2007, the Court of Appeals remanded to the MPSC,
for reconsideration, the MichCon recovery of merger control premium costs. DTE Energy and Detroit
Edison are unable to predict the financial or other outcome of any legal or regulatory proceeding
at this time. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the regulatory matters discussed herein. Resolution
of these matters is dependent upon future MPSC orders and appeals, which may materially impact the
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. NOTE 6 NUCLEAR OPERATIONS
General
Fermi 2, the Companys nuclear generating plant, began commercial operation in 1988. Fermi 2 has a
design electrical rating netof 1,150 MW. This plant represents approximately 10% of
Detroit Edisons summer net rated capability. The net book balance of the Fermi 2 plant was
written off at December31, 1998, and an equivalent regulatory asset was established. In 2001, the
Fermi 2 regulatory asset was securitized. Detroit Edison also owns Fermi 1, a nuclear plant that
was shut down in 1972 and is currently being decommissioned. The NRC has jurisdiction over the
licensing and operation of Fermi 2 and the decommissioning of Fermi 1. Property Insurance
Detroit Edison maintains several different types of property insurance policies specifically for
the Fermi 2 plant. These policies cover such items as replacement power and property damage. The
Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited NEILis the primary supplier of the insurance polices. Detroit Edison maintains a policy for extra expenses, including replacement power costs
necessitated by Fermi 2s unavailability due to an insured event. This policy has a 12-week
waiting period and provides an aggregate $490million of coverage over a three-year period. Detroit Edison has $500million in primary coverage and $225billion of excess coverage for
stabilization, decontamination, debris removal, repair and/or replacement of property and
decommissioning. The combined coverage limit for total property damage is $275billion. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 TRIAwas scheduled to expire on December15,
2007. Effective December26, 2007, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007
extended the TRIA though December31, 2014. A major change in the extension is the inclusion of
domestic acts of terrorism in the definition of covered or certified acts. For multiple terrorism losses caused by acts of terrorism not covered under the TRIA occurring
within one year after the first loss from terrorism, the NEIL policies would make available to all
insured entities up to $32billion, plus any amounts recovered from reinsurance, government
indemnity, or other sources to cover losses. Under the NEIL policies, Detroit Edison could be liable for maximum assessments of up to
approximately $31million per event if the loss associated with any one event at any nuclear plant
in the United States should exceed the accumulated funds available to NEIL. 102 Table of Contents Public Liability Insurance
As required by federal law, Detroit Edison maintains $300million of public liability insurance for
a nuclear incident. For liabilities arising from a terrorist act outside the scope of TRIA, the
policy is subject to one industry aggregate limit of $300million. Further, under the
Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 2005, deferred premium charges up to $101million could be levied
against each licensed nuclear facility, but not more than $15million per year per facility. Thus,
deferred premium charges could be levied against all owners of licensed nuclear facilities in the
event of a nuclear incident at any of these facilities.
Decommissioning
Detroit Edison has a legal obligation to decommission its nuclear power plants following the
expiration of their operating licenses. This obligation is reflected as an asset retirement
obligation on the Statements of Financial Position. Based on the actual or anticipated extended
life of the nuclear plant, decommissioning expenditures for Fermi 2 are expected to be incurred
primarily during the period of 2025 through 2050. It is estimated that the cost of decommissioning
Fermi 2, when its license expires in 2025, will be $13billion in 2007 dollars and $34billion in
2025 dollars, using a 6% inflation rate. In 2001, Detroit Edison began the decommissioning of
Fermi 1, with the goal of removing the radioactive material and terminating the Fermi 1 license.
The decommissioning of Fermi 1 is expected to be complete by 2010. The NRC has jurisdiction over the decommissioning of nuclear power plants and requires
decommissioning funding based upon a formula. The MPSC and FERC regulate the recovery of costs of
decommissioning nuclear power plants and both require the use of external trust funds to finance
the decommissioning of Fermi 2. Rates approved by the MPSC provide for the recovery of
decommissioning costs of Fermi 2 and the disposal of low-level radioactive waste. Detroit Edison
is continuing to fund FERC jurisdictional amounts for decommissioning even though explicit
provisions are not included in FERC rates. The Company believes the MPSC and FERC collections will
be adequate to fund the
estimated cost of decommissioning using the NRC formula. The decommissioning assets, anticipated
earnings thereon and future revenues from decommissioning collections will be used to decommission
the nuclear facilities. The Company expects the regulatory liabilities to be reduced to zero at
the conclusion of the decommissioning activities. If amounts remain in the trust funds for these
units following the completion of the decommissioning activities, those amounts will be disbursed
based on rulings by the MPSC and FERC. A portion of the funds recovered through the Fermi 2 decommissioning surcharge and deposited in
external trust accounts is designated for the removal of non-radioactive assets and the clean-up of
the Fermi site. This removal and clean-up is not considered a legal liability. Therefore, it is
not included in the asset retirement obligation, but is reflected as the nuclear decommissioning
regulatory liability. The decommissioning of Fermi 1 is funded by Detroit Edison. Contributions to the Fermi 1 trust are
discretionary. The following table summarizes the fair value of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets. 103 Table of Contents

At December31, 2007, investments in the external nuclear decommissioning trust funds consisted of
approximately 54% in publicly traded equity securities, 45% in fixed debt instruments and 1% in
cash equivalents. The debt securities had an average maturity of
approximately 53years.
At December31, 2006, investments in the external nuclear decommissioning trust funds consisted of

Securities held in the nuclear decommissioning trust funds are classified as available-for-sale.
As Detroit Edison does not have the ability to hold impaired investments for a period of time
sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery of market value, all unrealized losses are
considered to be other than temporary impairments. 104 Table of Contents Impairment charges for unrealized losses incurred by the Fermi 2 trust are recognized as a
regulatory asset. Detroit Edison recognized $22million and $10million of unrealized losses as
regulatory assets for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Since the
decommissioning of Fermi 1 is funded by Detroit Edison rather than through a regulatory recovery
mechanism, there is no corresponding regulatory asset treatment. Therefore, impairment charges for
unrealized losses incurred by the Fermi 1 trust are recognized in earnings immediately. For the
years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, Detroit Edison recognized impairment charges of $02
million in each year for unrealized losses incurred by the Fermi 1 trust.
Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs
In accordance with the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, Detroit Edison has a contract with
the U.S. Department of Energy DOEfor the future storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel from
Fermi 2. Detroit Edison is obligated to pay the DOE a fee of 1 mill per kWh of Fermi 2 electricity
generated and sold. The fee is a component of nuclear fuel expense. Delays have occurred in the
DOEs program for the acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel at a permanent repository.
Detroit Edison is a party in the litigation against the DOE for both past and future costs
associated with the DOEs failure to accept spent nuclear fuel under the timetable set forth in the
Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. Detroit Edison currently employs a used nuclear fuel
storage strategy utilizing a spent fuel pool. In December2007, Detroit Edison announced plans to
move to a dry cask storage method which is expected to provide sufficient storage capability for
the life of the plant. NOTE 7 JOINTLY OWNED UTILITY PLANT Detroit Edison has joint ownership interest in two power plants, Belle River and Ludington

Production tax credits are provided for qualified fuels produced and sold by a taxpayer to an
unrelated party during the taxable year. Production tax credits earned but not utilized totaled
$186million and are carried forward indefinitely as alternative minimum tax credits. The majority
of the production tax credits earned, including all of those from our synfuel projects, were
generated from projects that have received a private letter ruling PLRfrom the Internal Revenue
Service IRS. These PLRs provide assurance as to the appropriateness of using these credits to
offset taxable income, however, these tax credits are subject to IRS audit and adjustment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effect of temporary
differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and the reported amounts in the
financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent
according to the classification of the related assets or liabilities. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities not related to assets or

The above table excludes deferred tax liabilities associated with unamortized investment tax
credits that are shown separately on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The Company has state deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry-forwards of $28
million and $20million at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The state net operating loss
carry-forwards expire in 2008 through 2026. The Company has recorded valuation allowances at
December31, 2007 and 2006 of approximately $28million and $20million, respectively, a change of $8 million, with respect to deferred tax assets associated with state income taxes. In assessing
the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods
in which those temporary differences become deductible. Based upon the level of historical taxable
income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are
deductible, the Company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of
those deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowance as of December31, 2007. Uncertain Tax Positions The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No109 FIN 48 on January1, 2007. This interpretation
prescribes a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the
financial statement reporting of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. As a
result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized a $5million increase in liabilities
that was accounted for as a reduction to the January1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. 107 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows

The Company has $14million of unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2007 that, if recognized,
would favorably impact our effective tax rate. During the next twelve months, statutes of
limitations will expire for our tax returns in various states. It is reasonably possible that
there will be a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $8 million within the next twelve months. The Company recognizes interest and penalties pertaining to income taxes in Interest expense and
Other expenses, respectively, on its Consolidated Statements of Operations. Accrued interest
pertaining to income taxes totaled $7million at December31, 2007. The Company had no accrued
penalties pertaining to income taxes. The Company recognized interest expense related to income
taxes of $1million during 2007. The Companys U.S. federal income tax returns for years 2004 and subsequent years remain subject to
examination by the IRS. The Company also files tax returns in numerous state jurisdictions with
varying statutes of limitation. Michigan Business Tax On July12, 2007, the Michigan Business Tax MBTwas enacted by the State of Michigan to replace
the Michigan Single Business Tax MSBTeffective January1, 2008. The MBT is comprised of an
apportioned modified gross receipts tax of 08percent; and an apportioned business income tax of
495percent. The MBT provides credits for Michigan business investment, compensation, and
research and development. The MBT will be accounted for as an income tax. In 2007 a state deferred tax liability of $224million was recognized by the Company for cumulative
differences between book and tax assets and liabilities for the consolidated group. Effective
September30, 2007, legislation was adopted by the State of Michigan creating a deduction for
businesses that realize an increase in their deferred tax liability due to the enactment of the
MBT. Therefore, a deferred tax asset of $224million was established related to the future
deduction. The deduction will be claimed during the period of 2015 through 2029. The recognition
of the enactment of the MBT did not have an impact on our income tax provision for 2007. Of the $224million of deferred tax liabilities and assets recognized for the consolidated group 364million related to our regulated entities with the remainder related to our non-regulated
entities. The $364million of deferred tax liabilities and assets recognized by our regulated
utilities were offset by corresponding regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with SFAS
No71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, as the impacts of the deferred
tax liabilities and assets recognized upon enactment and amendment of the MBT will be reflected in
our rates. 108 Table of Contents NOTE 9 COMMON STOCK Common Stock The DTE Energy Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $1550billion of common
stock through 2009. Through December31, 2007, repurchases of approximately $725million of common
stock were made. Under the DTE Energy Company Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company grants non-vested stock awards
to key employees, primarily management. As a result of a stock award, a settlement of an award of
performance shares, or by exercise of a participants stock option, the Company may deliver common
stock from the Companys authorized but unissued common stock and/or from outstanding common stock
acquired by or on behalf of the Company in the name of the participant. The number of non-vested
restricted stock awards is included in the number of common shares outstanding; however, for
purposes of computing basic earnings per share, non-vested restricted stock awards are excluded. Dividends Certain of the Companys credit facilities contain a provision requiring the Company to maintain a
ratio of consolidated debt to capitalization equal to or less than 065:1, which has the effect of
limiting the amount of dividends the Company can pay in order to maintain compliance with this
provision. The effect of this provision as of December31, 2007 was to restrict approximately $197
million as payments for dividends of total retained earnings of approximately $28billion. There
are no other effective limitations with respect to the Companys ability to pay dividends. NOTE 10 EARNINGS PER SHARE The Company reports both basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is
computed by dividing income from continuing operations by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes the
issuance of potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period and the repurchase of
common shares that would have occurred with proceeds from the assumed issuance. Diluted earnings
per share assume the exercise of stock options. Non-vested restricted stock awards are included in
the number of common shares outstanding; however, for purposes of computing basic earnings per
share, non-vested restricted stock awards are excluded. A reconciliation of both calculations is
presented in the following table

stock in 2006, and two million shares in 2005 were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share because the options exercise price was greater than the average market price of
the common shares, thus making these options anti-dilutive. NOTE 11 LONG-TERM DEBT Long-Term Debt The Companys long-term debt outstanding and weighted average interest rates1 of debt

Trust Preferred-Linked Securities DTE Energy has interests in various unconsolidated trusts that were formed for the sole purpose of
issuing preferred securities and lending the gross proceeds to the Company. The sole assets of the
trusts are debt securities of DTE Energy with terms similar to those of the related preferred
securities. Payments the Company makes are used by the trusts to make cash distributions on the
preferred securities it has issued. The Company has the right to extend interest payment periods on the debt securities. Should the
Company exercise this right, it cannot declare or pay dividends on, or redeem, purchase or acquire,
any of its capital stock during the deferral period. DTE Energy has issued certain guarantees with respect to payments on the preferred securities.
These guarantees, when taken together with the Companys obligations under the debt securities and
related indenture, provide full and unconditional guarantees of the trusts obligations under the
preferred securities. Financing costs for these issuances were paid for and deferred by DTE Energy. These costs are
being amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the related securities. Remarketable Securities At December31, 2007, $75million of MichCon notes were subject to periodic remarketings. The
notes are subject to mandatory or optional tender on June30, 2008. The Company directs the
remarketing agents to remarket these securities at the lowest interest rate necessary to produce a
par bid. In the event that a remarketing fails, the Company would be required to purchase the
securities. The notes are classified as long-term debt due to the expected successful remarketing
in 2008. 111 Table of Contents Cross Default Provisions Substantially all of the net utility properties of Detroit Edison and MichCon are subject to the
lien of mortgages. Should Detroit Edison or MichCon fail to timely pay their indebtedness under
these mortgages, such failure may create cross defaults in the indebtedness of DTE Energy. Other As of December31, 2007, the Company had $238million of variable auction rate tax exempt bonds
outstanding. These bonds, which are subject to rate reset every 7days, are insured by bond
insurers. Overall credit market conditions have resulted in credit rating downgrades and may
result in future credit rating downgrades for the bond insurers. This has caused a loss in
liquidity in the auction rate markets for their insured bonds. These conditions have negatively
impacted interest rates, including default rates in the case of failed auctions. The Company does
not expect its interest rate exposure regarding these bonds to be material. NOTE 12 PREFERRED SECURITIES Preferred and Preference Securities Authorized and Unissued As of December31, 2007, the amount of authorized and unissued stock is as follows

NOTE 13 SHORT-TERM CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS AND BORROWINGS DTE Energy and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Detroit Edison and MichCon, have entered into
revolving credit facilities with similar terms. The five-year credit facilities are with a
syndicate of banks and may be used for general corporate borrowings, but are intended to provide
liquidity support for each of the companies commercial paper programs. The aggregate availability
under these combined facilities is $19billion as shown in the following table

112 Table of Contents Borrowings under the facilities are available at prevailing short-term interest rates. The
agreements require the Company to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of no more than
065 to l. Should the Company have delinquent debt obligations of at least $50million to any
creditor, such delinquency will
be considered a default under our credit agreements. DTE Energy, Detroit Edison and MichCon are
currently in compliance with these financial covenants. At December31, 2007 and December31, 2006,
respectively, the Company had approximately $82million and $123million of letters of credit
outstanding against these facilities. At December31, 2007, the Company had outstanding commercial paper of $761million and other
short-term borrowings of $323million, including Detroit Edison
and MichCon bank loans described below. At December31, 2006, the Company had outstanding commercial
paper of $1031billion and other short-term borrowings of $100million. The weighted average interest rate for short-term borrowings was 54% at December31, 2007 and
2006. DTE Energy has a $40million letter of credit and reimbursement agreement. Provisions for an
automatic one-year extension and conversion to a two-year term loan are available as long as
certain conditions are met. In conjunction with maintaining certain exchange traded risk management positions, the Company may
be required to post cash collateral with its clearing agent. The Company has a demand financing
agreement for up to $150million with its clearing agent. The amount outstanding under this
agreement was $13million and $23million at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Detroit Edison has a $200million short-term financing agreement secured by customer accounts
receivable. This agreement contains certain covenants related to the delinquency of accounts
receivable. Detroit Edison is currently in compliance with these covenants. The Company had an
outstanding balance of $125million and $100million at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Detroit Edison and MichCon initiated separate $100million short-term unsecured bank loans in the
fourth quarter of 2007. The purpose of these loans was to enhance liquidity and reduce reliance on
the commercial paper market. The loans have covenants identical to those specified under our
back-up credit facilities. Both Detroit Edison and MichCon were in compliance with those covenants
at December31, 2007. Detroit Edison and MichCon each had $100million outstanding under these
loans at December31, 2007. 113 Table of Contents NOTE 14 CAPITAL AND OPERATING LEASES Lessee The Company leases various assets under capital and operating leases, including coal cars,
office buildings, a warehouse, computers, vehicles and other equipment. The lease arrangements

NOTE 15 FINANCIAL AND OTHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Company complies with SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, as amended and interpreted. Under SFAS No. 133, all derivatives are recognized on the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at their fair value unless they qualify for certain scope exceptions, including
normal purchases and normal sales exception. Further, derivatives that qualify and are designated
for hedge accounting are classified as either hedges of a forecasted transaction or the variability
of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or
liability cash flow hedge,
or as hedges of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm
commitment fair value hedge. For cash flow hedges, the portion of the derivative gain or loss
that is effective in offsetting the change in the value of
114 Table of Contents the underlying exposure is deferred in
Accumulated other comprehensive income and later reclassified into earnings when the underlying
transaction occurs. For fair value hedges, changes in fair values for both the derivative and the
underlying hedged exposure are recognized in earnings each period. Gains and losses from the
ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized in earnings immediately. For derivatives that do
not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value are recognized in
earnings each period. The Companys primary market risk exposure is associated with commodity prices, credit, interest
rates and foreign currency. The Company has risk management policies to monitor and decrease
market risks. The Company uses derivative instruments to manage some of the exposure. The Company
uses derivative instruments for trading purposes in its Energy Trading segment and the coal
marketing activities of its Coal and Gas Midstream segment. The fair value of all derivatives is
included in Assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities on the Consolidated
Statements of Financial Position. Commodity Price Risk and Foreign Currency Risk Utility Operations Detroit Edison Detroit Edison generates, purchases, distributes and sells electricity. Detroit
Edison uses forward energy and capacity contracts to manage changes in the price of electricity and
fuel. Substantially all of these derivatives meet the normal purchases and sales exemption and are
therefore accounted for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts are recoverable
through the PSCR mechanism when realized. This results in the deferral of unrealized gains and
losses or regulatory assets or liabilities, until realized. MichCon MichCon purchases, stores, transmits and distributes natural gas and sells storage and
transportation capacity. MichCon has fixed-priced contracts for portions of its expected gas supply
requirements through 2011. MichCon may also sell forward storage and transportation capacity
contracts. These gas-supply, firm transportation, and storage contracts are designated and
qualify for the normal purchases and sales exemption and are therefore accounted for under the
accrual method. Non-Utility Operations Power and Industrial Projects These business segments manage and operate on-site energy and steel
related projects, landfill gas recovery and power generation assets. These businesses utilize
fixed-priced contracts in the marketing and management of their assets. These contracts are not
derivatives and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method. Unconventional Gas Production The Unconventional Gas business is engaged in unconventional gas
project development and production. The Company uses derivative contracts to manage changes in the
price of natural gas. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Amounts recorded in
other comprehensive loss will be reclassified to earnings, specifically as a component of operating
revenues, as the related production affects earnings through 2010. In 2007 and 2006, $222million
and $86million, respectively, of after-tax losses were reclassified to earnings, principally
related to the Antrim business. See Note 3 for further discussion of the discontinuance of a
portion of cash flow hedge accounting upon sale of the Antrim business. In 2008, management
estimates reclassifying an after-tax gain of approximately $1million to earnings related to the
Barnett cash flows. Energy Trading Commodity Price Risk Energy Trading markets and trades wholesale electricity and natural gas physical
products, energy financial instruments, and provides risk management services utilizing energy
commodity derivative instruments. Forwards, futures, options and swap agreements are used to manage
exposure to the risk of market price and volume fluctuations in its operations. These derivatives
are accounted for by recording changes in fair value to earnings, specifically as a component of
Operating revenues, unless certain hedge accounting criteria are met. This fair value accounting
better aligns financial reporting with the way the business is managed and its performance is
measured. Energy Trading experiences earnings
115 Table of Contents volatility as a result of its gas inventory and
other non-derivative assets that do not qualify for fair value accounting under accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. Although the risks associated with these asset positions
are substantially offset, requirements to fair value the related derivatives result in unrealized
gains and losses being recorded to earnings that eventually reverse upon settlement. Energy Trading Foreign Currency Risk Energy Trading has foreign currency forward contracts to hedge fixed Canadian dollar commitments
existing under power purchase and sale contracts and gas transportation contracts. The Company
entered into these contracts to mitigate any price volatility with respect to fluctuations of the
Canadian dollar
relative to the U.S. dollar. Certain of these contracts were designated as cash flow hedges with
changes in fair value recorded to Other comprehensive income. Amounts recorded to Other
comprehensive income are classified to Operating revenues or Fuel, purchased power and gas expense
when the related hedged item impacts earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, amounts recorded in Other comprehensive income will
be reclassified to earnings, specifically as a component of Operating revenues, as the related
forecasted transaction affects earnings through 2008. In 2007 and 2006, $7million and $8million,
respectively, of after-tax losses were reclassified to earnings. In 2008, management estimates
reclassifying an after-tax gain of approximately $1million to earnings. Coal and Gas Midstream These business units are primarily engaged in services related to
transportation of coal as well as the transportation, processing and storage of natural gas. These
businesses utilize fixed-priced contracts in their marketing and management of their businesses.
Generally these contracts are not derivatives and are therefore accounted for under the accrual
method. The business unit also engages in coal marketing which includes the marketing and trading
of physical coal products and coal financial instruments. Certain of these physical and financial
coal contracts are derivatives and are accounted for by recording changes in fair value to
earnings, specifically as a component of Operating revenues, unless certain hedge accounting
criteria are met. Credit Risk The utility and non-utility businesses are exposed to credit risk if customers or counterparties do
not comply with their contractual obligations. The Company maintains credit policies that
significantly minimize overall credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of potential
customers and counterparties financial condition, credit rating, collateral requirements or other
credit enhancements such as letters of credit or guarantees. The Company generally uses
standardized agreements that allow the netting of positive and negative transactions associated
with a single counterparty. The Company maintains a provision for credit losses based on factors surrounding the credit risk of
its customers, historical trends, and other information. Based on the Companys credit policies
and its December31, 2007 provision for credit losses, the Companys exposure to
counterparty nonperformance is not expected to result in material
effects on the Companys financial statements. Interest Rate Risk The Company uses interest rate swaps, treasury locks and other derivatives to hedge the risk
associated with interest rate market volatility. In 2004 and 2000, the Company entered into a
series of interest rate derivatives to limit its sensitivity to market interest rate risk
associated with the issuance of long-term debt. Such instruments were designated as cash flow
hedges. The Company subsequently issued long-term debt and terminated these hedges at a cost that
is included in other comprehensive loss. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive loss will be
reclassified to Interest expense as the related interest affects earnings through 2030. In 2008,
the Company estimates reclassifying $4million of losses to earnings. 116 Table of Contents Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The fair value of financial instruments is determined by using various market data and other
valuation techniques. The table below shows the fair value relative to the carrying value for
long-term debt securities. The carrying value of certain other financial instruments, such as
notes payable, customer deposits and notes receivable approximate
fair value and are not shown. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had approximately $1
billion of tax exempt securities insured by insurers. Since December 31, 2007, overall credit market conditions have resulted in credit rating downgrades and may result in future credit rating downgrades for these insurers. The Company does not expect the impact on interest rates or fair value to be material.

plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. In March2005, EPA issued additional
emission reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate, regional haze and mercury air
pollution. The new rules will lead to additional controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce
nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions. To comply with these requirements, Detroit
Edison has spent approximately $11billion through 2007. The Company estimates Detroit Edison
future capital expenditures at up to $282million in 2008 and up to $24billion of additional
capital expenditures through 2018 to satisfy both the existing and proposed new control
requirements. Water In response to an EPA regulation, Detroit Edison is required to examine alternatives for
reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its
facilities. Based on the results of the studies to be conducted over the next several years,
Detroit Edison may be required to install additional control technologies to reduce the impacts of
the water intakes. Initially, it was estimated that Detroit Edison could incur up to approximately
$55million over the four to six years subsequent to 2007 in additional capital expenditures to
comply with these requirements. However, a recent court decision remanded back to the EPA several
provisions of the federal regulation that may result in a delay in compliance dates. The decision
also raised the possibility that Detroit Edison may have to install cooling towers at some
facilities at a cost substantially greater than was initially estimated for other mitigative
technologies. Contaminated Sites Detroit Edison conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites,
including three former manufactured gas plant MGPsites, the area surrounding an ash landfill and
several underground and aboveground storage tank locations. The findings of these investigations
indicated that the estimated cost to remediate these sites is approximately $15million that was
accrued in 2007 and is expected to be incurred over the next several years. In addition, Detroit
Edison expects to make approximately $6million of capital improvements to the ash landfill in
2008. Gas Utility Contaminated Sites Prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines, gas for
heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal, coke or oil. Gas
Utility owns, or previously owned, 15 such former MGP sites. Investigations have revealed
contamination related to the by-products of gas manufacturing at each site. In addition to the MGP
sites, the Company is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites. Cleanup
activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years. 117 Table of Contents The MPSC has established a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism for investigation and
remediation costs incurred at former MGP sites. Accordingly, Gas Utility recognizes a liability and
corresponding regulatory asset for estimated investigation and remediation costs at former MGP
sites. During 2007, the Company spent approximately $2million investigating and remediating these
former MGP sites. The Company accrued an additional $1million in remediation liabilities to
increase the reserve balance to $40million as of December31, 2007, with a corresponding increase
in the regulatory asset. Any significant change in assumptions, such as remediation techniques, nature and extent of
contamination and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for
the sites and affect the Companys financial position and cash flows. However, the Company
anticipates the
cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism approved by the MPSC will prevent environmental costs
from having a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Non-Utility The Companys non-utility affiliates are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations
dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants. The Company is in the
process of installing new environmental equipment at our coke battery facilities in Michigan. The
Company expects the projects to be completed within two years. The coke battery facilities received
and responded to information requests from the EPA resulting in the issuance of a notice of
violation regarding potential maximum achievable control technologies and new source review
violations. The EPA is in the process of reviewing the Companys position of demonstrated
compliance and has not initiated escalated enforcement. At this time, the Company cannot predict
the impact of this issue. The Companys non-utility affiliates are substantially in compliance with
all environmental requirements, other than as noted above. Guarantees In certain limited circumstances, the Company enters into contractual guarantees. The Company may
guarantee another entitys obligation in the event it fails to perform. The Company may provide
guarantees in certain indemnification agreements. Finally, the Company may provide indirect
guarantees for the indebtedness of others. Below are the details of specific material guarantees
the Company currently provides. Millennium Pipeline Project Guarantee The Company owns a 2625% equity interest in the Millennium Pipeline Project Millennium.
Millennium is accounted for under the equity method. Millennium is expected to begin commercial
operations in November2008. On August29, 2007, Millennium entered into a borrowing facility to finance the construction costs
of the project. The total facility amounts to $800million and is guaranteed by the project
partners, based upon their respective ownership percentages. The facility expires on August29,
2010. The amount outstanding under this facility was $153million at December31, 2007. Proceeds of
the facility are being used to fund project costs and expenses relating to the development,
construction and commercial start up and testing of the pipeline project and for general corporate
purposes. In addition, the facility has been utilized to reimburse the project partners for costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the project for the period subsequent to June1, 2004
through immediately prior to the closing of the facility. The Company received approximately $235
million in September2007 as reimbursement for costs and expenses incurred by it during the
above-mentioned period. The Company accounted for this reimbursement as a return of capital. 118 Table of Contents The Company has agreed to guarantee 2625% of the borrowing facility in the event of default by
Millennium. The guarantee includes DTE Energys revolving credit facilitys covenant and default
provisions by reference. The Company has also provided performance guarantees in regards to
completion of Millennium to the major shippers in an amount of approximately $16million. The
maximum potential amount of future payments under these guarantees is approximately $226million.
There are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable us to recover any amounts paid
under the guarantees other than our share of project assets. Parent Company Guarantee of Subsidiary Obligations The Company has issued guarantees for the benefit of various non-utility subsidiary transactions.
In the event that DTE Energys credit rating is downgraded below investment grade, certain of these
guarantees would require the Company to post cash or letters of credit valued at approximately $488
million at
December31, 2007. This estimated amount fluctuates based upon commodity prices primarily power
and gas and the provisions and maturities of the underlying agreements. Other Guarantees The Companys other guarantees are not individually material with maximum potential payments
totaling $10million at December31, 2007. Labor Contracts There are several bargaining units for the Companys represented employees. In October2007, a new
three-year agreement was ratified by approximately 950 employees in our gas operations. In December
2007, a new three-year agreement was ratified by approximately 3,100 employees in our electric
operations and corporate services. The contracts of the remaining represented employees expire at
various dates in 2008 and 2009. Purchase Commitments Detroit Edison has an Energy Purchase Agreement to purchase steam and electricity from the Greater
Detroit Resource Recovery Authority GDRRA. Under the Agreement, Detroit Edison will purchase
steam through 2008 and electricity through June2024. In 1996, a charge to income was recorded that
included a reserve for steam purchase commitments in excess of replacement costs from 1997 through
2008. The reserve for steam purchase commitments totaling $20million at December31, 2007 is being
amortized to fuel, purchased power and gas expense with non-cash accretion expense being recorded
through 2008. The Company estimates steam and electric purchase commitments from 2008 through 2024
will not exceed $343million. In January2003, the Company sold the steam heating business of
Detroit Edison to Thermal Ventures II, LP. Under the terms of the sale, Detroit Edison remains
contractually obligated to buy steam of $33 million from GDRRA until 2008. Also, the Company guaranteed bank loans of $13million that
Thermal Ventures II, LP may use for capital improvements to the steam heating system. During 2007,
the Company recorded reserves of $13million related to the bank loan guarantee. As of December31, 2007, the Company was party to numerous long-term purchase commitments relating
to a variety of goods and services required for the Companys business. These agreements primarily
consist of fuel supply commitments and energy trading contracts. The Company estimates that these
commitments will be approximately $59billion from 2008 through 2051. The Company also estimates
that 2008 capital expenditures will be approximately $15billion. The Company has made certain
commitments in connection with expected capital expenditures. 119 Table of Contents Bankruptcies The Company purchases and sells electricity, gas, coal, coke and other energy products from and to
numerous companies operating in the steel, automotive, energy, retail and other industries.
Certain of the Companys customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Company regularly reviews contingent matters relating to these customers
and its purchase and sale contracts and it records provisions for amounts considered at risk of
probable loss. Management believes the Companys previously accrued amounts are adequate for
probable losses. The final resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material effect
on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Other Contingencies Detroit Edison and the Coal Transportation and Marketing business were involved in a contract
dispute with BNSF Railway Company that was referred to arbitration. Under this contract, BNSF
transports western coals east for Detroit Edison and the Coal Transportation and Marketing
business. The Company filed a breach of contract claim against BNSF for the failure to provide
certain services that it believed
were required by the contract. The Company received an award from the arbitration panel in
September2007 that held that BNSF is required to provide such services under the contract and
awarded damages to the Company. The Company entered into a settlement agreement with BNSF pursuant
to which BNSF will provide the required services. The Company is involved in certain legal, regulatory, administrative and environmental proceedings
before various courts, arbitration panels and governmental agencies concerning claims arising in
the ordinary course of business. These proceedings include certain contract disputes, additional
environmental reviews and investigations, audits, inquiries from various regulators, and pending
judicial matters. The Company cannot predict the final disposition of such proceedings. The Company
regularly reviews legal matters and records provisions for claims it can estimate and are
considered probable of loss. The resolution of these pending proceedings is not expected to have a
material effect on the Companys operations or financial statements in the periods they are
resolved. See Note 5 for a discussion of contingencies related to Regulatory Matters. NOTE 17 RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND TRUSTEED ASSETS Adoption of SFAS No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension
and Other Postretirement Plans an Amendment of FASB Statements
No87, 88, 106, and 132R. SFAS No. 158 requires companies to 1recognize the over funded or under funded status of defined benefit
pension and other postretirement plans in its financial statements, 2recognize as a component of
other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains or losses and the prior service costs
or credits that arise during the period but are not immediately recognized as components of net
periodic benefit cost, 3recognize adjustments to other comprehensive income when the actuarial
gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition assets or obligations are
recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost, 4measure postretirement benefit plan
assets and plan obligations as of the date of the employers statement of financial position, and
5disclose additional information in the notes to financial statements about certain effects on
net periodic benefit cost in the upcoming fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the
actuarial gains and losses and the prior service cost and credits. The requirement to recognize the funded status of a postretirement benefit plan and the related
disclosure requirements is effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2006. The Company
adopted this requirement as of December31, 2006. The requirement to measure plan assets and
benefit obligations as
120 Table of Contents of the date of the employers fiscal year-end statement of financial
position is effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2008. The Company plans to adopt
this requirement as of December31, 2008.
Retrospective application of the changes required by SFAS No158 is prohibited; therefore certain
disclosures below are not comparable. Detroit Edison received approval from the MPSC to record the charge related to the additional
liability as a Regulatory asset since the traditional rate setting process allows for the recovery
of pension and other postretirement plan costs. Measurement Date All amounts and balances reported in the following tables as of December31, 2007 and December31,
2006 are based on measurement dates of November30, 2007 and November30, 2006, respectively. Qualified and Nonqualified Pension Plan Benefits The Company has qualified defined benefit retirement plans for eligible represented and
non-represented employees. The plans are noncontributory and cover substantially all employees. The
plans provide traditional retirement benefits based on the employees years of benefit service,
average final compensation and age at retirement. In addition, certain represented and
non-represented employees are covered under cash balance provisions that determine benefits on
annual employer contributions and interest credits. The Company also maintains supplemental
nonqualified, noncontributory, retirement benefit plans for selected management employees. These
plans provide for benefits that supplement those provided by DTE Energys other retirement plans. The Companys policy is to fund qualified pension costs by contributing amounts consistent with the
Pension Protection Act of 2006 provisions and additional amounts when it deems appropriate. In
December2007, the Company contributed $150million to the qualified pension plans. The Company
anticipates making up to a $150million contribution to its qualified pension plans in 2008 and a
$5million contribution to its nonqualified pension plans in 2008. Net pension cost includes the following components

The Company employs a consistent formal process in determining the long-term rate of return for
various asset classes. Management reviews historic financial market risks and returns and long-term
historic relationships between the asset classes of equities, fixed income and other assets,
consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that asset classes with higher
volatility generate a greater return over the long-term. Current market factors such as inflation,
interest rates, asset class risks and asset class returns are evaluated and considered before
long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The long-term portfolio return is also
established employing a consistent formal process, with due consideration of diversification,
active investment management and rebalancing. Peer data is reviewed to check for reasonableness. The Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities, fixed income and
other investments are used to maximize the long-term return on plan assets consistent with prudent
levels of risk. The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses over the long-term. Risk
tolerance is established through consideration of future plan cash flows, plan funded status, and
corporate financial considerations. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of
equity, fixed income and other investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across
U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, growth and value investment styles, and large and small market
capitalizations. Other assets such as private equity and absolute return funds are used judiciously
to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification. Derivatives may be
utilized in a risk controlled manner, to potentially increase the portfolio beyond the market value
of invested assets and reduce portfolio investment risk. Investment risk is measured and monitored
on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies, and
quarterly investment portfolio reviews. The Companys plans weighted-average asset allocations by asset category at December31 were as

The Company also sponsors defined contribution retirement savings plans. Participation in one of
these plans is available to substantially all represented and non-represented employees. The
Company matches employee contributions up to certain predefined limits based upon eligible
compensation, the employees contribution rate and, in some cases, years of credited service. The
cost of these plans was $29million in each of the years 2007, 2006, and 2005. Other Postretirement Benefits The Company provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for employees
who are eligible for these benefits. The Companys policy is to fund certain trusts to meet its
postretirement benefit obligations. Separate qualified Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association
VEBAtrusts exist for represented and non-represented employees. In December2007, the Company
made cash contributions of $76million to its postretirement benefit plans. In January2008, the
Company made cash contributions of $40million to its postretirement benefit plans. At the
discretion of management, the Company may make up to a $116million contribution to its VEBA trusts
in 2008. Net postretirement cost includes the following components

In December2003, the Medicare Act was signed into law which provides for a non-taxable federal
subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least
actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law. The effects of the subsidy reduced net
periodic postretirement benefit costs by $16million in 2007, $17million in 2006, and $20million
in 2005. 128 Table of Contents At December31, 2007, the gross amount of federal subsidies expected to be received in each of the

Grantor Trust MichCon maintains a Grantor Trust that invests in life insurance contracts and income securities.
Employees and retirees have no right, title or interest in the assets of the Grantor Trust, and
MichCon can revoke the trust subject to providing the MPSC with prior notification. The Company
accounts for its investment at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded to earnings. NOTE 18 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The DTE Energy Stock Incentive Plan permits the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualifying
stock options, stock awards, performance shares and performance units. Participants in the plan
include the Companys employees and members of its Board of Directors. In 2006, the Company
adopted a new Long-Term Incentive Program LTIP. The following are the key points of the LTIP   
Authorized limit is 9,000,000 shares of common stock   
Prohibits the grant of a stock option with an exercise price that is less than the fair
market value of the Companys stock on the date of the grant; and   
Imposes the following award limits to a single participant in a single calendar year,
1options for more than 500,000 shares of common stock; 2stock awards for more than
150,000 shares of common stock; 3performance share awards for more than 300,000 shares
of common stock based on the maximum payout under the award; or 4more than 1,000,000
performance units, which have a face amount of $100 each. Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment, using the
modified prospective transition method. Under this method, the Company records compensation expense
at fair value over the vesting period for all awards it grants after the date it adopted the
standard. In addition, the Company is required to record compensation expense at fair value as
previous awards continue to vest for the unvested portion of previously granted stock option
awards that were outstanding as of the date of adoption. Pre-adoption grants of stock awards and
performance shares will continue to be expensed. DTE Energy did not make the one-time election to
adopt the alternative transition method described in FSP SFAS No. 123R-3, Transition Election Related
to Accounting for the Tax Effect of Share-Based Payment Awards, but has chosen instead to follow
the original guidance provided by SFAS No. 123R in accounting for the tax effects of stock
based compensation awards. Stock-based compensation for the reporting periods is as follows

129 Table of Contents The
cumulative effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in 2006 was an increase in net income of $1
million as a result of estimating forfeitures for previously granted stock awards and performance
shares.
The Company has not restated any prior periods as a result of the
adoption of SFAS No. 123R. The
Company generally purchases shares on the open market for options that are exercised or it may
settle in cash other stock-based compensation. Options Options are exercisable according to the terms of the individual stock option award agreements and
expire 10years after the date of the grant. The option exercise price equals the fair value of
the stock on the date that the option was granted. Stock options granted vest ratably over a
three-year period. Stock option activity was as follows
