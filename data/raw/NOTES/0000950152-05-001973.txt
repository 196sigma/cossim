23 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Stoneridge, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Stoneridge, Inc. an Ohio Corporation and Subsidiaries as of
December31, 2004 and 2003 and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2004. Our audit also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at . These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Stoneridge, Inc. and
Subsidiaries at December31, 2004 and 2003 and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2004, in conformity with U.S.generally
accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein. As explained in Note2 to the consolidated financial
statements, effective January1, 2003, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Statement
No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, under the prospective transition method in

otherwise indicated   
1.
Organization and Nature of Business Stoneridge, Inc. and its subsidiaries are independent designers
and manufacturers of highly engineered electrical and electronic
components, modules and systems for the automotive, medium- and
heavy-duty truck, agricultural and off-highway vehicle markets.   
2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Stoneridge and its wholly-owned and majority-owned
subsidiaries collectively, the Company.
Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation.   
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all short-term investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash
equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value,
due to the highly liquid nature and short-term duration of the
underlying securities.   
Accounts Receivable Concentrations Revenues are principally generated from the automotive, medium-
and heavy-duty truck, agricultural and off-highway vehicle
markets. Due to the nature of these industries, a significant
portion of sales and related accounts receivable are
concentrated in a relatively small number of customers. In 2004,
the Companys top four customers individually accounted for
approximately 21%, 11%, 8% and 7% of net sales, while the top
five customers accounted for 54% of net sales. In 2003, the
Companys top four customers individually accounted for
approximately 17%, 11%, 9% and 9% of net sales, while the top
five customers accounted for approximately 53% of net sales. In
2002, the Companys top four customers individually
accounted for 13%, 13%, 10% and 10% of net sales, while the top
five customers accounted for 52% of net sales. Accounts
receivable from the Companys five largest customers
aggregated approximately $65,319 and $51,240 at
December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.   
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined using the last-in, first-out LIFOmethod for
approximately 67% and 68% of the Companys inventories at
December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and by the
first-in, first-out FIFOor average cost method for all
other inventories. Inventory cost includes material, labor and
overhead. Inventories consist of the following at

Depreciation is provided by both the straight-line and
accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Depreciation expense for the years ended
December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $25,137, $21,904 and
$21,083, respectively. Depreciable lives within each property
classification are as follows

1040years
Machinery and equipment
520years
Office furniture and fixtures
310years
Tooling
25years
Vehicles
35years
Leasehold improvements

Maintenance and repair expenditures that are not considered
improvements and do not extend the useful life of property are
charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements
and major renewals are capitalized. When assets are retired or
otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss
on the disposition is credited or charged to income.   
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
SFAS142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, goodwill is subject to at least an annual
assessment for impairment by applying a fair value-based test.
The Company has determined that it has four reporting units and
two of these reporting units have goodwill that was tested for
impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS142 as
of the fourth quarter of 2004. The Company used a combination of
valuation techniques, which included consideration of
market-based approaches and an income approach, in determining
the fair value of the Companys applicable reporting units
in the annual impairment test of goodwill. The Company believes
that the combination of the valuation models provides a more
appropriate valuation of the Companys reporting units by
taking into account different marketplace participant
assumptions. The Company utilized market and income approaches,
specifically the guideline company method market, the
transaction method market, and the discounted cash flow method
income, in its estimates of fair value of the Companys
reporting units being tested and an equal weight was given to
each of these three methods. 30 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless
otherwise indicated These methodologies were applied to the reporting units
adjusted historical and projected financial performance.
Earnings were emphasized in all three methods used. In addition,
all three methods utilized market data in the derivation of a
value estimate and are forward-looking in nature. The guideline
company method and the transaction method utilized pricing
multiples that are based on the markets assessment of
future performance, and the discounted cash flow method utilized
a market-derived rate of return to discount anticipated
performance. The initial impairment test indicated that the carrying value of
one of the Companys reporting units exceeded the
corresponding fair value of the reporting unit. The implied fair
value of goodwill in this reporting unit was then determined
through the allocation of the fair value to the underlying
assets and liabilities. As of the fourth quarter of 2004, the
carrying value of the goodwill in this reporting unit, which is
included in the Control Devices reportable segment, exceeded its
implied fair value by $1835million. The corresponding
write-down of goodwill to its fair value was reported as a
component of operating loss in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations. This goodwill impairment charge resulted primarily from the
Companys change in its strategic growth initiative, and
the resulting focus on the design and development of highly
engineered products by four operating segments. This strategic
redirection along with sales and organizational realignment was
completed in the fourth quarter of 2004. Under the provisions of
SFAS131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information, two of these four operating
segments are aggregated for reporting purposes into the
Companys Vehicle Management Power Distribution
reportable segment and two are aggregated into the Company
Control Devices reportable segment. Factors contributing to the
impairment charge include SFAS142 provisions requiring the
Company to test goodwill for impairment at a more disaggregated
level due to the Companys realignment into four operating
segments, which also represent the Companys reporting
units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. The change in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable
segment during 2004 was as follows

Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the provisions of
SFAS109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred
income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of
differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and
their financial reporting amounts. Future tax benefits are
recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is
determined to be more likely than not.   
Currency Translation The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, where the
local currency is the functional currency, are translated into
U.S.dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of
the period for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates
during each reporting period for the results of operations.
Adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements
are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income loss. Foreign currency transactions are remeasured into
the functional currency using translation rates in effect at the
time of the transaction, with the resulting adjustments included
in the results of operations.   
Revenue Recognition and Sales Commitments The Company recognizes revenues from the sale of products, net
of actual and estimated returns, at the point of passage of
title, which is generally at the time of shipment. Actual and
estimated returns are based on authorized returns and historical
trends of sales returns. The Company often enters into
agreements with its customers at the beginning of a given
vehicles expected production life. Once such agreements
are entered into, it is the Companys obligation to fulfill
the customers purchasing requirements for the entire
production life of the vehicle. These agreements are subject to
renegotiation, which may affect product pricing.   
Bad Debts The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable
based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where the
Company is aware of a specific customers inability to meet
its financial obligations, a specific allowance for doubtful
accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net
recognized receivable to the amount the Company reasonably
believes will be collected. Additionally, the Company reviews
historical trends for collectibility in determining an estimate
for its allowance for doubtful accounts. If economic
circumstances change substantially, estimates of the
recoverability of amounts due to the Company could be reduced by
a material amount. The Company does not have collateral
requirements with its customers. 32 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Product Development Expenses Expenses associated with the development of new products and
changes to existing products are charged to expense as incurred.
These costs amounted to $36,145, $28,714 and $25,332 in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.   
Share-Based Compensation At December31, 2004, the Company had two share-based
compensation plans, which are described more fully in
Note7. Prior to 2003, the Company accounted for employee
share options granted under these plans using the intrinsic
value method provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. APB25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations. No share-based
employee compensation cost was recognized in 2002, as all
options granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to
the market value of the underlying common shares on the date of
grant. Effective January1, 2003, the Company adopted the
fair value recognition provisions of SFAS123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
prospectively to all employee awards granted, modified or
settled after January1, 2003, under the disclosure
provisions of SFAS148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure
an amendment of SFAS123. Option awards under the
Companys plans cliff-vest over periods ranging from one to
five years, and compensation expense is recognized on a
straight-line basis. Restricted share awards vest over a period
of one to three years and compensation expense is also
recognized on a straight-line basis. Because the Company adopted
the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS123 on a
prospective basis, the cost related to share-based employee
compensation recognized in 2004 and 2003 is less than that which
would have been recognized if the fair value based method had
been applied to all awards granted since the original effective
date of 33 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless
otherwise indicated SFAS123. The following table illustrates the effect on net
loss income and net loss income per share if the fair value
based method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested
awards in each period.

The fair value of options granted was estimated at the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the

The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. Option valuation models
require the input of highly subjective assumptions including
expected share price volatility and expected option lives. The fair value of restricted shares granted was calculated using
the market value of the shares on the date of issuance.   
Financial Instruments and Derivative Financial
Instruments Financial instruments held by the Company include cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, long-term
debt and forward currency contracts. The carrying value of cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable
is considered to be representative of fair value because of the
short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of the
Companys variable rate debt approximates its fair value.
Refer to Note9 of the Companys consolidated
financial statements for fair value disclosures of the
Companys fixed rate debt, and foreign currency forward
contracts.   
Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S.generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of 34 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless
otherwise indicated assets and liabilities, including certain self-insured risks and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Because
actual results could differ from those estimates, the Company
revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes
available.   
Net Loss Income Per Share Net loss income per share amounts for all periods are
presented in accordance with SFAS128, Earnings per
Share, which requires the presentation of basic net loss
income per share and diluted net loss income per share. Basic
net loss income per share was computed by dividing net loss
income by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding for each respective period. Diluted net loss
income per share was calculated by dividing net loss income by
the weighted-average of all potentially dilutive common shares
that were outstanding during the periods presented. Actual
weighted-average shares outstanding used in calculating basic
and diluted net loss income per share were as follows

Diluted net loss per share for 2004, as reported in the
Companys Statements of Operations in accordance with
SFAS128, disregards the effect of potentially dilutive
common shares, as a net operating loss causes dilutive shares to
have an anti-dilutive effect. Options to purchase225,000, 481,000 and 497,000 common
shares at an average price of $1656, $1622 and $1622per
share were outstanding at December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. These outstanding options were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share because their
respective exercise prices were greater than the average market
price of common shares and, therefore, their effect would have
been anti-dilutive.   
Comprehensive Loss Income SFAS130, Reporting Comprehensive Income,
establishes standards for the reporting and display of
comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes
foreign currency translation adjustments and gains and losses
from certain foreign currency transactions, the effective
portion of gains and losses on certain hedging activities,
minimum pension liability adjustments, and unrealized gains and
losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. Balances of each after-tax component of accumulated other

Consolidated Shareholders Equity as of December31,

Impairment of Assets The Company reviews its long-lived assets and intangible assets
with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. Except for the impairment of goodwill, no
significant impairment charges were recorded in 2004, 2003 and
2002. Impairment would be recognized when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may
not be recovered. Measurement of the amount of impairment may be
based on appraisal, market values of similar assets or estimated
discounted future cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate
disposition of the asset.   
Accounting Standards In January 2003, the FASB issued interpretation FIN46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an
Interpretation of ARB No51. FIN46 requires
unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by
their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively
disperse the risks and rewards of ownership among their owners
and other parties involved. The provisions of FIN46 were
applicable immediately to all variable interest entities created
after January31, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued
FIN46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities an Interpretation of ARB No51
revised December 2003, which includes significant
amendments to previously issued FIN46. Among other things,
FIN46R includes revised transition dates for public
entities, which required the Company to adopt the provisions of
FIN46 as of March31, 2004. The adoption of this
interpretation did not impact the Companys consolidated
financial statements. In December 2003, the FASB revised SFAS132
Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits. This statement revises
employers disclosures about pension and other
postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement
or recognition of those plans required by
SFASNos87, 88 and 106. The revised SFAS requires
additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows
and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans
and other defined benefit postretirement plans. This Statement
became effective for the year ended after June15, 2004.
The additional disclosure requirements are included in
Note8 to the Companys consolidated financial
statements. In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 the Act was signed into law. The Act
introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare as well as
a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit
plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially
equivalent to the benefit established by law. In May 2004, the
FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSPFAS106-2
FAS106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003. The FSP provides guidance on
how to account for the federal subsidy. The Company adopted
FAS106-2 in 2004 and it did not have a material impact on
the Companys consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS123R,
Share-Based Payment, which requires all companies to
measure compensation cost for all share-based payments
including employee share options at fair value. This Statement
becomes effective for interim period beginning after
June15, 2005. The Company adopted the fair-value
provisions of SFAS123 in 2003; therefore, this standard is
not expected to have a material impact the Companys
consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS151, Inventory
Costs, as an amendment to ARB No43, Chapter4,
Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling
costs and wasted materials spoilage. This Statement requires
that these items be recognized as current-period charges and
requires the allocation of fixed production overheads 36 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless
otherwise indicated to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. This Statement becomes effective for inventory costs
incurred during fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005.
The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS151 to
have a material impact on the Companys consolidated
financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued two FSPs that provide
accounting guidance on how companies should account for the
effects of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act that
was signed into law in October 2004. The Act could affect how
companies report their deferred income tax balances. The first
FSP is FSP FAS109-1 FAS109-1; the second is FSP
FAS109-2 FAS109-2. In FAS109-1, the FASB
concluded that the tax relief special tax deduction for
domestic manufacturing companies from the Act should be
accounted for as a special deduction instead of a
tax rate reduction. The Company has reviewed FSP FAS109-1.
The Company has not issued financial statements that treat the
domestic manufacturing deduction as a rate
reduction. Therefore, FSP FAS109-1 did not impact the
Companys financial statements for 2004. The Company will
treat the domestic manufacturing deduction as a special
deduction in financial statements issued for 2005 and forward.
FAS109-2 gives companies additional time to evaluate the
effects of the Act on any plan for reinvestment or repatriation
of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. However, companies must
provide certain disclosures if it chooses to utilize the
additional time granted by the FASB. The Company did not
repatriate foreign earnings during 2004. It is managements
intent not to repatriate foreign earnings during 2005 and
beyond. Therefore, no disclosure is required. These FSPs,
which were effective immediately, did not have a material impact
on the Companys consolidated financial statements.   
Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
their 2004 presentation in the consolidated financial statements.   
3.
Investments The Company has a 50% interest in PST Industria Eletronica da
Amazonia Ltda. PST, a Brazilian electronic components business
that specializes in electronic vehicle security devices. The
investment is accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. The Companys investment in PST was $15,323 and
$13,309 at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
Company had a note receivable with PST of $1,148 and $5,843, as
of December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A significant
portion of the note receivable was paid back to the Company in
2004. Equity earnings losses of PST of $1,677, $1,288 and
$763 for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively, were classified as other income
expensein the consolidated statements of operations. The Company has a 20% interest in Minda Instruments LTD Minda,
a company based in India that manufactures electronic
instrumentation equipment for the automotive and truck markets.
The investment is accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. The Companys investment in Minda was $781 at
December31, 2004. Equity earnings of Minda of $21, for the
year ended December31, 2004 were classified as other
income in the consolidated statements of operations.

Long-Term Debt On May1, 2002, the Company issued $2000million
aggregate principal amount of senior notes. The
$2000million notes bear interest at an annual rate of
1150% and mature on May1, 2012. The senior notes are
redeemable in May 2007 at 10575. Interest is payable on
May1 and November1 of 37 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless
otherwise indicated each year. On July1, 2002, the Company completed an
exchange offer of the senior notes for substantially identical
notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933. In conjunction with the issuance of the senior notes, the
Company also entered into a new $2000million credit
agreement with a bank group. The credit agreement had the
following components: a $1000million revolving facility
of which $962million was available at December31,
2004, after consideration of outstanding letters of credit,
which includes a $100million swing line facility, and a
$1000million term facility. The revolving facility
expires on April30, 2008 and requires a commitment fee of
0375% to 0500% on the unused balance. The revolving facility
permits the Company to borrow up to half its borrowings in
specified foreign currencies. Interest is payable quarterly at
either ithe prime rate plus a margin of 025% to 125%
or iiLIBOR plus a margin of 175% to 275%, depending
upon the Companys ratio of consolidated total debt to
consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization EBITDA, as defined. Interest on the swing line
facility is payable monthly at the quoted overnight borrowing
rate plus a margin of 175% to 275%, depending upon the
Companys ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated
EBITDA, as defined. The Company prepaid the entire outstanding
balance of the term facility during 2003. The weighted average interest rate in effect for the years ended
December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was approximately 1150 1024% and 953%, respectively, including the effects of the
interest rate swap agreements. Long-term debt consisted of the following at December31

For the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, the
Companys effective tax rate decreased from 311% to
380%. The effective tax rate for 2004 decreased primarily due
to the tax benefit recognized on the loss. The rate decrease was
marginally impacted by a reduction in state taxes which was
offset by a reduction in credits and the impact of the goodwill
impairment charge. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries were $20,538 11,062 and $12,046 as of December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Because these earnings have been indefinitely
reinvested in foreign operations, no provision has been made for
U.S.income taxes. It is impracticable to determine the
amount of unrecognized deferred taxes with respect to these
earnings; however, foreign tax credits should be available to
reduce U.S.income taxes in the event of a distribution. 39 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Operating Lease Commitments The Company leases equipment, vehicles and buildings from third
parties under operating lease agreements. D.M. Draime, Chairman of the Company, is a 50% owner of Hunters
Square, Inc. HSI, an Ohio corporation, which owns
Hunters Square, an office complex and shopping mall located in
Warren, Ohio. The Company leases office space in Hunters Square.
The Company pays all maintenance, tax and insurance costs
related to the operation of the office. Lease payments made by
the Company to HSI were $301, $301 and $357 in 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. The lease terminates in December 2009. The
Company believes the terms of the lease are no less favorable to
it than would be the terms of a third-party lease. For the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, lease
expense totaled $6,455, $6,874 and $7,142, including related
party lease expense of $301, $451 and $509, respectively. 40 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Share-Based Compensation Plans In October 1997, the Company adopted a Long-Term Incentive Plan
the Incentive Plan. The Company has reserved 2,500,000 Common
Shares for issuance to key management level employees under the
Incentive Plan. Under the Incentive Plan, the Company has
granted cumulative options to purchase1,594,500 Common
Shares to management with exercise prices equal to the fair
market value of the Companys Common Shares on the date of
grant. The options issued cliff-vest ratably from one to five
years after the date of grant. Under the Incentive Plan, the
Company has also granted 108,400 restricted shares to management
with a compensation value equal to the market value on the date
of issuance. The restricted shares issued vest over a one to
three-year period. Restricted shares awarded under the Incentive
Plan entitle the shareholder to all the rights of Common Share
ownership except that the shares may not be sold, transferred,
pledged, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of during the
restriction period. In May 2002, the Company adopted a Director Share Option Plan
the Director Plan. The Company has reserved 500,000 Common
Shares for issuance under the Director Plan. Under the Director
Plan, the Company has granted cumulative options to
purchase146,000 Common Shares to directors of the Company
with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the

Employee Benefit Plans The Company has certain defined contribution profit sharing and
401k plans covering substantially all of its employees.
Company contributions are generally discretionary; however, a
portion of these 42 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless
otherwise indicated contributions is based upon a percentage of employee
compensation, as defined in the plans. The Companys policy
is to fund all benefit costs accrued. For the years ended
December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, expenses related to these
plans amounted to $4,134, $3,757 and $345, respectively. The Company has a single defined benefit pension plan that
covers certain employees in the United Kingdom and a single
postretirement benefit plan that covers certain employees in the
U.S.The following table sets forth the benefit obligation,

The Companys expected long-term return on plan assets
assumption is based on a periodic review and modeling of the
plans asset allocation and liability structure over a
long-term horizon. Expectations of returns for each asset class
are the most important of the assumptions used in the review and
modeling and are based on comprehensive reviews of historical
data and economic/ financial market theory. The expected
long-term rate of return on assets was selected from within the
reasonable range of rates determined by ahistorical real
returns, net of inflation, for the asset classes covered by the 44 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

The Company has one non-pension postretirement benefit plan. The
healthcare portion of the plan is contributory, with
participants contributions adjusted annually; the life
insurance portion of the plan is noncontributory. Assumed
healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the
amounts reported for the healthcare portion. A 1% point change

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 the Act was signed into law. The Act
introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare Medicare
PartD as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree
health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at
least actuarially equivalent to Medicare PartD. As of
December31, 2004, the Company recognized the effects of
the Act in the measure of its projected and accumulated benefit
obligation under its postretirement benefit plan in accordance
with FSP FAS106-2 and it did not have a material impact on
the Companys consolidated financial statements. The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation
and fair value of plan assets for the Companys defined
benefit pension plan were $19,985, $19,985 and $15,559,
respectively, as of December31, 2004 and $15,170, $15,170

The Companys investment policy for the defined benefit
pension plan includes various guidelines and procedures designed
to ensure assets are invested in a manner necessary to meet
expected future benefits earned by participants. The investment
guidelines consider a broad range of economic conditions.
Central to the policy are target allocation ranges shown above
by major asset categories. The objectives of the target
allocations are to maintain investment portfolios that diversify
risk through prudent asset allocation parameters, achieve asset
returns that meet or exceed the plans actuarial
assumptions, and achieve asset returns that are competitive with
like institutions employing similar investment strategies. The
Company and a designated third-party fiduciary periodically
review the investment policy. The policy is established and
administered in a manner so as to comply at all times with
applicable government regulations. The Company expects to contribute $183 to its defined benefit
pension plan in 2005. The following pension and postretirement
benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as
appropriate, are expected to be paid

The provisions of SFAS87, Employers Accounting
for Pensions, require the Company to record an additional
minimum liability for the defined benefit pension plan of $2,876
and $738 at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This
liability represents the amount by which the accumulated benefit
obligation exceeds the sum of the fair market value of plan
assets and accrued amounts previously recorded. A corresponding
charge was recorded as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income of $2,224 and $443, net of related tax
benefits of $653 and $295, at December31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. On December31, 2003 the Company amended the defined
benefit pension plan to eliminate the linkage between future
service and salary derived plan benefits. The defined benefit
plan will continue to provide certain life insurance and
disability benefits to participants. Affected members of the
plan, which numbered 159, were offered membership in the
Companys defined contribution plan. As a result of the
curtailment, the projected benefit obligation of the plan was
reduced by $1,945 in 2003.   
9.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments A financial instrument is cash or a contract that imposes an
obligation to deliver, or conveys a right to receive cash or
another financial instrument. The carrying values of cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable are
considered to be representative of their fair value because of
the short maturity of these instruments. The estimated fair
value of the Companys senior 46 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless
otherwise indicated notes fixed rate debt at December31, 2004, per quoted
market sources, was $2313million and the carrying value
was $2000million. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce
exposure to market risks resulting from fluctuations in interest
rates swapsand currency rates forward contracts. The
Company does not enter into financial instruments for
speculative or profit motivated purposes. Management believes
that its use of these instruments to reduce risk is in the
Companys best interest. At December31, 2004 and
2003, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swaps. In order to manage the interest rate risk associated with the
Companys previous debt portfolio, the Company entered into
interest rate swap agreements. These agreements required the
Company to pay a fixed interest rate to counterparties while
receiving a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. The
counterparties to each of the interest rate swap agreements were
major commercial banks. These agreements were due to mature on
or before December31, 2003 and qualified as cash flow
hedges; however, as a result of the Companys debt
refinancing, these agreements were terminated on May1,
2002. Hedging activities recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income loss are as follows

As of December31, 2003 these terminated swap agreements
were fully amortized into income. The Company has entered into foreign currency forward purchase
contracts with a notional value of 584million of Swedish
krona to reduce exposure related to the Companys krona
denominated receivables and 20million of British pounds
to reduce exposure related to the Companys pound
denominated payables. The estimated fair value of these forward
contracts at December31, 2004, per quoted market sources,
was $11million. These forward contracts are marked to
market, with gains and losses recognized in the consolidated
statement of operations as a component of other income
expense. The Companys foreign currency forward purchase
contracts substantially offset losses and gains on the
underlying foreign denominated receivables and payables.   
10.
Commitments and Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in
various legal proceedings, workers compensation and
product liability disputes. The Company is of the opinion that
the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a
material adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows
or the financial position of the Company. On January15, 2004, a judgment was entered against the
Company in the District Court
365th
Judicial District in Maverick County, Texas. The plaintiffs
alleged in their complaint that a Company fuel valve installed
as a replacement part on a truck caused a fire after an accident
resulting in a death. The plaintiffs are the parents of the
decedent. The judgment entered against the Company was
approximately $365million. The Company denies the claim
that its fuel valve contributed to the fire. The trial 47 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless
otherwise indicated court denied a motion for a new trial and other relief. An
appeal of this judgment has been filed. The Company believes
that there are valid grounds to reverse the judgment on appeal.
If successful, the appeal may alter or eliminate the amount of
the existing judgment. While legal proceedings are subject to
inherent uncertainty, the Company believes that it is reasonably
possible that this award will be substantially altered or
eliminated by the appellate court. Consequently, in the opinion
of management and the Companys legal counsel, it is not
possible to estimate the outcome of such uncertainty at this
time. The Company will record a provision for any liability in
this case, if and at the time that management and counsel
conclude a loss is probable. Based upon advice received from the
Companys legal counsel, the Company believes a loss
resulting from this matter is not probable at December31,
2004. Even at full judgment, however, the Companys
exposure is significantly less than the $365million
mentioned above, as it has been mitigated with appropriate
levels of insurance.   
11.
Related Party Transactions Avery Cohen, a director of the Company, is a partner in
Baker Hostetler LLP, a law firm, which has served as
general outside counsel for the Company since 1993 and is
expected to continue to do so in the future. The Company paid
$1,255, $940 and $1,082 in legal fees to Baker
Hostetler LLP for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. See Note6 to the Companys consolidated financial
statements for information on the Companys related party
transactions involving operating leases.   
12.
Segment Reporting SFAS131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information, establishes standards for
reporting information about operating segments in financial
statements. Operating segments are defined as components of an
enterprise that are evaluated regularly by the Companys
chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate
resources and in assessing performance. The Companys chief
operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer. The Company has two reportable segments: Vehicle
Management Power Distribution and Control Devices.
These reportable segments were determined based on the
differences in the nature of the products offered. The Vehicle
Management Power Distribution reportable segment
produces electronic instrument clusters, electronic control
units, driver information systems and electrical distribution
systems, primarily wiring harnesses and connectors for
electrical power and signal distribution. The Control Devices
reportable segment produces electronic and electromechanical
switches, control actuation devices and sensors, and driver
information systems. As a result of changes in executive leadership during 2004, the
Company realigned senior management responsibilities under four
operating segments effective for the fourth quarter 2004. These
four operating segments are aggregated for reporting purposes
into the Companys Vehicle Management Power
Distribution and Control Devices reportable segments. The
Companys chief operating decision maker also changed the
profit measure used to evaluate the business to Income
Loss Before Income Taxes and Cumulative Effect of Accounting
Change. Because the Company changed the structure of its
internal organization in a manner that caused the composition of
its reportable segments to change, and because the profit
measure used to evaluate the business changed, the corresponding
information for prior periods has been restated to conform to
the current year reportable segment presentation. The accounting policies of the Companys reportable
segments are the same as those described in Note2,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The
Companys chief operating decision maker evaluates the
performance of the reportable segments based primarily on
revenues from external 48 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless
otherwise indicated customers, capital expenditures and income loss before income
taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change. Intersegment
sales are accounted for on terms similar to those to third
parties and are eliminated upon consolidation. A summary of financial information by reportable segment is as
