FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA MANAGEMENTS
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting as defined in Rules13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the board of directors regarding the preparation
and fair presentation of published financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide
only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December31, 2007, our
internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2007 has been audited by Schneider Downs Co. Inc., an independent registered public accounting firm which also audited our consolidated financial statements. Schneider Downs attestation report on the consolidated
financial statements and managements maintenance of effective internal control over financial reporting is included under the heading Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.  /s/ Dennis M. Oates

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Universal Stainless Alloy Products, Inc. We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Universal Stainless Alloy Products, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December31, 2007. In addition, our audit included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at  2Schedule II. We also have audited the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys
management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting
based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.  /s/ Schneider Downs Co., Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies Description of the Company. Universal Stainless Alloy
Products, Inc. the Company manufactures and markets semi-finished and finished specialty steel products, including stainless steel, tool steel and certain other alloyed steels. The Companys manufacturing process involves melting,
remelting, treating, and hot and cold rolling of semi-finished and finished specialty steels. The Companys products are sold to rerollers, forgers, service centers, original equipment manufacturers OEMs, which primarily include
the power generation and aerospace industries, and wire redrawers. The Company also performs conversion services on materials supplied by customers that lack certain of the Companys production facilities or that are subject to their own
capacity constraints. Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. The estimates and assumptions used in these consolidated financial statements are based on
known information available as of the balance sheet date. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Basis of Consolidation. The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company has no interests in any unconsolidated entity nor
does it have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at
cost plus accrued interest, which approximates market value, and include cash and securities having a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. Concentration of Credit Risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company limits its credit risk associated with cash
and cash equivalents by placing its investments in high-grade short-term instruments. With respect to accounts receivable, the Company limits its credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and, when deemed necessary, requiring letters of
credit, guarantees or cash collateral. The allowance for doubtful accounts includes specific reserves for the value of outstanding invoices issued to customers currently operating under the protection of the federal bankruptcy law and other amounts
that are deemed potentially not collectible with a reserve equal to 15% of 90-day or older balances. However, the total reserve will not be less than 1% of total accounts receivable. Receivables are charged-off to the allowance when they are deemed
to be uncollectible. Bad debt expense for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $29,000, 77,000 and $125,000, respectively. Inventories.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost principally determined by the first-in, first-out FIFO method. The average cost method is also utilized. Such costs include the acquisition cost for raw materials and supplies, direct
labor and applied manufacturing overhead within the guidelines of normal plant capacity. Provisions are made for slow-moving inventory based upon managements expected method of disposition. The Company purchases scrap metal and alloy additives, principally nickel, chrome and molybdenum, for its melting operation. A substantial portion of the alloy additives
is available only from foreign sources, some of which are located in countries that may be subject to unstable political and economic conditions. Those conditions might disrupt supplies or affect the prices of the raw materials used by the Company.
The Company maintains sales price surcharges to help offset the impact of raw material price fluctuations. Included in inventory are operating materials
consisting of production molds and rolls that will normally be consumed within one year. Property, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and
equipment is recorded at cost. Costs incurred in connection with the construction or major rebuild of facilities, including interest directly related to the project, are capitalized as construction in progress. No depreciation is recognized on these
assets until placed in service. Retirements and disposals are removed from cost and accumulated depreciation accounts, with the gain or loss reflected in operating income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and costs of
improvements and renewals are capitalized. In September2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB Staff Position
entitled Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities FSP. The FSP amends an American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Industry Audit Guide and is applicable to all industries that accrue for planned major
maintenance activities. The FSP prohibits the use of the accrue-in-advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance costs, which is the policy the Company presently uses to record planned plant outage costs on an interim basis within a
fiscal year. The FSP became effective January1, 2007, with retrospective application to all prior periods presented. Under the FSP, the Company will report results using the deferral method whereby material major equipment maintenance costs
are capitalized as incurred and amortized into expense over the subsequent six-month period, while other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The restatement of maintenance expenses for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005 changed
previously reported financial data by the following amounts:   2006 2005 dollars in thousands, except per share amounts Change in cost of products sold 40 484 Change in net income 24 298  Change in earnings per common share Basic 001 005 Diluted 001 005
24 Table of Contents
Maintenance expense for the fiscal year 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $13,857,000, $12,060,000 and $12,412,000, respectively.
Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful
lives of buildings and land improvements are between 5 and 25 years, and the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment are between 5 and 20 years. Direct costs incurred in the development and implementation of internal-use software are
capitalized and recorded within property, plant and equipment, and amortized on a straight-line basis over its anticipated useful life, which generally does not exceed three years. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal year 2007, 2006 and
2005 was $3,722,000, $3,315,000 and $3,058,000, respectively. Long-Lived Asset Impairment. Long-lived assets, including property, plant and
equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in relation to the operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying
assets. Adjustments are made if the sum of expected future cash flows is less than book value. Based on managements assessment of the carrying values of such long-lived assets, no impairment reserve had been deemed necessary as of
December31, 2007 and 2006 except for the reserve attributed to the $184,000 carrying value of the Dunkirk office building which management has not sold since its acquisition in February 2002. Revenue Recognition. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when both risk of loss and title have transferred to the customer, which in most cases
coincides with shipment of the related products, and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue from conversion services is recognized when the performance of the service is complete. Invoiced shipping and handling costs are also accounted for as
revenue. Customer claims are accounted for primarily as a reduction to gross sales after the matter has been researched and an acceptable resolution has been reached. Revenue is also recognized in certain situations in which products available for shipment are held at the Companys facility beyond the stated shipment date at the customers specific request. The Company
manufactures specialty steel product to customer purchase order specifications and in recognition of requirements for product acceptance. Material certification forms are executed, indicating compliance with the customer purchase orders, before the
specialty steel products are packed and shipped to the customer. Occasionally customers request that the packed products be held at the Companys facility beyond the stated shipment date. In these situations, the Company receives written
confirmation of the request, and acknowledgement that title has passed to the customer and that normal payment terms apply. Such amounts included in revenue for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were less than 1% of net sales.
Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for unused tax credits earned and the tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of
assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. The Company uses the liability method to account for income taxes, which requires deferred taxes to be recorded at the statutory rate expected to be in effect when the
taxes are paid. Valuation allowances are provided for a deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized. In June
2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48. FIN 48 prescribes recognition and measurement standards for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
The evaluation of a tax position includes a determination of whether a tax position should be recognized in the financial statements, and such a position should only be recognized if the Company determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the
tax position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities, based upon the technical merits of the position. For those tax positions that should be recognized, the measurement of a tax position is determined as being the largest amount
of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 was effective at the beginning of the Companys 2007 fiscal year. Upon adoption of FIN 48, the Company made an accounting policy election to
classify interest and penalties on estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions as components of the provision for income taxes. The Company believes there are no known uncertain tax positions at December31, 2007. Stock-Based Compensation Plans. Prior to January1, 2006, employee compensation expense under stock option plans was reported only if options were granted
below market price at grant date in accordance with the intrinsic value method of Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. Because the exercise price of
the Companys employee stock options always equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense was recognized on options granted. On January1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting StandardsNo123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R. This Statement replaces FASB Statement No123 and supersedes APB Opinion No25. SFAS123R eliminates the ability to
account for stock-based compensation using APB25 and requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation expense in the income statement based on their fair values on the measurement date, 
25 Table of Contents
which, for the Company, is the date of the grant. The Company transitioned to fair-value based accounting for stock-based compensation using a modified
version of prospective application modified prospective application. Under modified prospective application, as it is applicable to the Company, SFAS123R applies to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased or cancelled
after January1, 2006. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered generally referring to non-vested awards that were outstanding as of January1, 2006 will be
recognized as the remaining requisite service is rendered during the period of and/or the periods after the adoption of SFAS123R. The attribution of compensation cost for those earlier awards is based on the same method and on the same
grant-date fair values previously determined for the pro forma disclosures required for companies that did not previously adopt the fair value accounting method for stock-based employee compensation. Compensation expense for non-vested stock awards
is based on the fair value of the awards, which is calculated on the measurement date, the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and is recognized ratably over the service period of the award. The tax effects of exercising
stock options are added to additional paid-in capital at the exercise date. Earnings Per Common Share. Basic earnings per common share is computed
by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus all dilutive
potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive common shares are determined using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, exercise of options is assumed at the beginning of the period when the average stock price
during the period exceeds the exercise price of outstanding options, and common shares are assumed issued. The assumed proceeds from the exercise of stock options are used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. The
incremental shares to be issued are considered to be the dilutive potential common shares outstanding. New Accounting Pronouncements. In September
2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 108 Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements SAB 108. SAB 108 requires that public
companies utilize a dual approach when assessing the quantitative effects of financial misstatements. This dual approach includes both an income statement-focused assessment and a balance sheet-focused assessment. The guidance in SAB 108
is effective for annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after November15, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have an effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157, which
establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities. This framework is intended to provide increased consistency in how fair value determinations are made under various existing accounting standards that permit, or in some
cases require, estimates of fair market value. SFAS 157 also expands financial statement disclosure requirements about a companys use of fair value measurements, including the effect of such measures on earnings. SFAS 157 is effective for
fiscal years that begin after November15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 157; however, the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
Including an amendment of FASB Statement No115 SFAS 159. This Statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and report unrealized gains and losses
on these instruments in earnings. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years that begin after November15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 159. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated
financial statements. On December4, 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No141 Revised 2007, Business Combinations SFAS
141R. SFAS 141R will significantly change the accounting for business combinations. Under SFAS 141R, an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the
acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. SFAS 141R will change the accounting treatment for certain specific items, including: acquisition costs will be generally expensed as incurred; noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair
value at the acquisition date; acquired contingent liabilities will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for non-acquired
contingencies; restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date
generally will affect income tax expense. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2008. Earlier
adoption is prohibited. Accordingly, the Company is required to record and disclose business combinations following existing GAAP until January1, 2009. On December4, 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial StatementsAn Amendment of ARB No51 SFAS 160. SFAS 160
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as
equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. SFAS 160
clarifies that changes in a parent ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, this statement requires that a parent
recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on 
26 Table of Contents
the deconsolidation date. SFAS 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. SFAS
160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. Reclassifications. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 presentation. Note 2: Inventory

Line with a term expiring on June30, 2009. This credit agreement also included a term loan PNC Term Loan scheduled to mature on June30, 2011. The Company retired the PNC Term Loan in December 2007. The credit
agreement is collateralized by substantially all of the Companys assets. Interest on borrowings under the PNC Line and PNC Term Loan is based on
short-term market rates, which may be further adjusted, based upon the Company maintaining certain financial ratios. PNC Bank reduced the commitment fee paid on the unused portion of the PNC Line from 05% to 025%, provided certain financial ratios
are maintained. The Company is required to be in compliance with three financial covenants: a minimum leverage ratio, a minimum debt service ratio and a minimum tangible net worth. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants at
December31, 2007. The Company maintains two separate loan agreements with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvanias Department of Commerce,
aggregating $600,000. A $200,000 15-year loan bears interest at 5%per annum with the term ending in 2011 and a $400,000 20-year loan bears interest at 6%per annum with the term ending in 2016. In 1996, the Company entered into a
ten-year, 6% interest-bearing loan agreement with the Redevelopment Authority of Allegheny County Economic Development Fund in the amount of $1,514,000, and was fully amortized in 2007. On February14, 2002, Dunkirk Specialty Steel issued two

327 352 345 Dunkirk Specialty Steel operates in a New York State Empire Zone and is qualified to benefit from investments made
and employees hired at the Dunkirk, New York facility for up to 15 years from its 2002 acquisition date. The Company recognized tax credit benefits of $591,000 and $378,000 for fiscal year 2007 and 2006, respectively, of which $252,000 and $339,000
was applied against the respective years current tax provision. The balance of the credits, which have no expiration date, will be applied against future tax liabilities for income apportioned to New York State. The Company believes it will
generate sufficient income in addition to taxable income generated from the reversal of its temporary differences to utilize this tax credit. The Company
also recognized Pennsylvania Educational Improvement Tax Credit benefits PAEIT of $180,000 for both 2007 and 2006, which were applied against each respective years current tax provision.

These audits include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. The Company has settled all IRS examinations through December31, 2004.
Note 6: Stockholders Equity The Company has
never paid a cash dividend on its Common Stock. The Companys Credit Agreement with PNC Bank limits the payment of cash dividends payable on its Common Stock to 50% of the Companys excess cash flow per fiscal year. Excess cash flow
represents the amount of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization that is greater than the sum of the Companys payments for interest, income taxes, the principal portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations,
and capital expenditures.  CommonSharesOutstanding

PLAN The Company maintains the Stock Incentive Plan that has been adopted and amended from time to time by the Companys Board of Directors, and
approved by its stockholders. The Stock Incentive Plan permits the issuance of stock options to non-employee directors, other than those directors owning more than 5% of the Companys outstanding Common Stock, officers and other key employees
of the Company who are expected to contribute to the Companys future growth and success. The Company may grant options up to a maximum of 950,000 shares of Common Stock, of which 393,668 are available for grant at December31, 2007. The
option price is equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock at the date of grant. Options granted to non-employee directors vest over a three-year period, and options granted to employees vest over a four-year period. All options under the
Stock Incentive Plan will expire no later than ten years after the grant date. Forfeited options may be reissued and are included in the amount available for grants. A summary of the Stock Incentive Plan activity as of and for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is presented below:

26 Proceeds from stock option exercises totaled $898,000 in 2007, $14million in 2006 and $703,000 in 2005.
Shares issued in connection with stock option exercises are issued from available authorized shares. Tax benefits realized from stock options exercised totaled $958,000 in 2007, $11 million in 2006 and $207,000 in 2005. Based upon the closing stock price of $3557, the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding stock options and outstanding exercisable stock options was $70million
and $59million, respectively, at December31, 2007. Intrinsic value of stock options is calculated as the amount by which the market price of USAP common stock exceeds the exercise price of the options. The aggregate intrinsic value of
stock options exercised was $26million in 2007, $28million in 2006 and $538,000 in 2005. The total fair value of share awards vested was $328,000 during 2007, $327,000 in 2006 and $274,000 in 2005. Stock-Based Compensation Expense. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS123R on January1, 2006. SFAS123R requires that stock-based
compensation to employees and directors be recognized as compensation expense in the income statement based on their fair values on the measurement date, which, for the Company, is the date of the grant. The value of the portion of the award that is
ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. The compensation expense recognized and its related tax effects are included in additional paid-in capital. Additional paid-in capital is further adjusted for
the difference between compensation expense recorded under SFAS 123R and compensation expense reported for tax purposes upon actual exercise of employee stock options. Stock-based compensation expense totaled $427,000 in 2007 and $273,000 in 2006. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period for all awards. The tax benefit associated with
the stock compensation expense recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations was $152,000 in 2007 and $95,000 in 2006. Such cash flows were previously reported as operating activities. Unrecognized stock-based compensation
expense related to non-vested stock awards totaled $1,548,000 at December31, 2007. At such date, the weighted-average period over which this unrecognized expense was expected to be recognized was 33 months. Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation. The fair value of the Companys employee stock options granted is estimated on the measurement date, which, for the
Company, is the date of grant. The Company elected to continue using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which was previously used for the Companys pro forma information required under SFAS 123. The weighted-average fair value of stock
options granted was $2,689,000 for 2007, $554,000 for 2006, and $327,000 for 2005. The Companys determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant is affected by the Companys stock price as well as assumptions
regarding the Companys expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The assumptions used to determine the fair value of options granted are detailed in the table below:  2007 2006 2005 Risk-free interest rate
353to487 319to504 376to450 Dividend yield
00 00 00  Expected market price volatility
47 to 49 45 to 50 40 to 45  Weighted-average expected market price volatility
479 476 435  Expected term
58to82years 50 years 50 years
The risk-free interest rate was developed using the U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods equal to the expected
life of the options at the grant date. No dividend yield was assumed because the Company does not pay cash dividends on Common Stock and currently has no 
31 Table of Contents
plans to pay a dividend. Expected volatility is based on the long-term historical volatility estimated over a period equal to the expected term of the
options of the Companys stock. In estimating the fair value of stock options under the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately. The expected
term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Pro Forma Net Income and Earnings Per Common
Share. In accordance with SFAS 123R, the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS 123R. The following pro forma information presents net income
and earnings per share for 2005 as if the fair value method of SFAS123 had been used to measure compensation cost for stock-based compensation plans. For purposes of this pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of stock options and
stock awards is amortized to expense over the related vesting periods.

At the
Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company held May17, 2006, shareholders approved an amendment to the Stock Purchase Plan to reserve an additional 60,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance under the plan. Under the terms of the plan,
employees can choose as of January1 and July1 of each year to have up to 10% of their total earnings withheld to purchase up to 100 shares of the Companys Common Stock each six-month period. The purchase price of the stock is 85%
of the lower of its beginning-of-the-period or end-of-the-period market prices. At December31, 2007, the Company has issued 96,312 shares of Common Stock since the plans inception. CASH INCENTIVE PLANS The Company has a management cash incentive plan
covering certain key executives and employees and profit-sharing plans that cover the remaining employees. The profit-sharing plans provide for the sharing of pre-tax profits in excess of specified amounts. For the years ended December31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company expensed $5,823,000, $5,285,000 and $3,510,000, respectively, under these plans. Note 9: Retirement Plans
The Company has defined contribution retirement plans that cover substantially all employees. The Company accrues its contributions to the hourly
employee plan based on time worked while contributions to the salaried plan are accrued as a fixed amount per month. Company contributions to both plans are funded periodically. Effective January6, 2003, the Company began to participate in the Steelworkers Pension Trust Trust, a multi-employer defined-benefit pension plan that is open to all hourly and salaried employees
associated with the Bridgeville facility. The Company makes periodic contributions to the Trust based on hours worked at a fixed rate for each hourly employee and a fixed monthly contribution on behalf of each salaried employee. The hourly employees
may continue their contributions to the defined contribution retirement plan even if the Company contributions cease. The Company also makes a contribution to the defined contribution retirement plan on behalf of each salaried employee participating
in the Trust. The amount of the contribution for salaried employees will be dependent upon their contribution to the 401k retirement plan. The total
expense for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $873,000, $888,000 and $772,000, respectively, including $531,000, $572,000 and $449,000, respectively, for the multi-employer Trust. No other post-retirement benefit plans exist.

Note 10: Commitments and Contingencies The Company, as well as other steel companies, is subject to demanding environmental standards imposed by federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. The Company is not aware of any environmental
condition that currently exists at any of its facilities that would cause a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company. The Company
is subject to various claims and legal actions that arise in the normal course of conducting business. At December31, 2007, the Company has established a reserve of $200,000 for commercial product-claims related to three sales by Dunkirk
Specialty Steel. The Company maintains a supply contract agreement with Talley Metals. While the initial term of the agreement expired December31,
2002, the agreement continues to automatically renew with the placement of new orders each month and requires a 90-day written notice to terminate by either party. In addition, Talley Metals is required under the agreement to purchase a minimum of
1,000 tons of stainless reroll billet products each calendar month and to average at least 1,250 tons per month during the last 12-month period. The value of the contract on a monthly basis will depend on product mix and key raw material prices.
During 2006 and 2007, Talley Metals did not comply with the monthly minimum purchase requirement due to market conditions. The Company has granted a waiver and expects to continue granting a waiver from this requirement until market conditions
improve. The CDSOA provides for payment of import duties collected by the U.S. Treasury to domestic companies injured by unfair foreign trade practices.
The assets purchased by Dunkirk Specialty Steel were previously owned and operated by AL Tech Specialty Steel, Inc. and Empire Specialty Steel, Inc. During their ownership, both organizations participated in several anti-dumping lawsuits with other
domestic specialty steel producers. In accordance with the CDSOA, the Company filed claims to receive its appropriate share of the import duties collected. In January 2005, the Company received $59,000 from the U.S. Treasury, representing an
increase in the total allocation of available funds awarded to the Company for 2004. The Company received a net payment of $358,000 in December 2005 as its 2005 award. In 2006 and 2007 the Company received $586,000 and $463,000, respectively, net of
expenses incurred. The Companys purchase obligations include the value of all open purchase orders with established quantities and purchase prices,
as well as minimum purchase commitments, all made in the normal course of business. At December31, 2007, the Companys total purchase obligations were $10,255,000, all of which will be due in year 2008. Note 11: Segment and Related Information The Company comprises three
operating locations and one corporate headquarters. For segment reporting, the Bridgeville and Titusville facilities have been aggregated into one reportable segment, Universal Stainless Alloy Products, because of the management reporting
structure in place. The Universal Stainless Alloy Products manufacturing process involves melting, remelting, treating and hot and cold rolling of semi-finished and finished specialty steels. A second reportable segment, Dunkirk Specialty
Steel, was created in 2002 with the acquisition of certain assets and real property formerly owned by Empire Specialty Steel, Inc. Dunkirk Specialty Steels manufacturing process involves hot rolling and finishing specialty steel bar, rod and
wire products. At December31, 2007, 82% of the Companys 533 employees are covered by USW collective bargaining agreements, and 46% of
employees are covered by an agreement for the Bridgeville facility that expires in August 2008. The accounting policies of both reportable segments are
the same as those described in Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies. Sales between the segments are generally made at market-related prices. Corporate assets are primarily cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, deferred income taxes, and
property, plant and equipment.

Diluted 061 070 086 094 The Companys 2007 third quarter results include a charge of $14 million for a Lower-of-Cost-or-Market
reserve due to the decline in nickel costs during the quarter, offset by the impact from increasing nickel costs in comparison to prior quarters on the Companys Dunkirk segment. Based upon the timing of surcharges, nickel cost changes
increased gross margin by $15 million. Earnings were positively impacted by a reduction in the annual income tax rate to 340% from 350%. The change in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to adjustments to state income provisions and
New York Empire Zone tax credits. Nickel costs declined from the third to fourth quarter of 2007. The impact from the change in nickel costs on the
Companys Dunkirk segment reduced gross margins by an estimated $53,000 compared with an increase of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. The impact from the change in nickel costs combined with lower total shipment volume reduced
company-wide gross margin dollars in the fourth quarter 2007 compared with the same period of 2006. The Companys 2007 fourth quarter earnings were positively impacted by the receipt of import duties of $586,000 and a reduction in the annual
income tax rate to 327% from 342%. The change in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to adjustments to state income provisions and tax credits as well as the impact of recognizing a $180,000 tax credit in Pennsylvania as a result of
participating in the states PAEIT in the fourth quarter 2007. The Companys 2006 fourth quarter earnings were positively impacted by the
receipt of import duties of $463,000 and a reduction in the annual income tax rate to 354% from 360%. The change in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to a favorable shift of apportioned income for state income tax purposes as
well as the impact of recognizing a $180,000 PAEIT tax credit. Earnings per share amounts for each quarter are required to be computed independently. As a
result, their sum may not equal the total year earnings per share amounts. The restatement of maintenance expenses for the year ended December31,

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The Companys management, including
