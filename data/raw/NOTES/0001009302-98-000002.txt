Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Elamex, S.A. de C.V. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Elamex, S. A. de
C.V. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1997. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Elamex, S.A. de C.V.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.                KPMG Peat Marwick LLP El Paso, Texas

estimates.

In addition, the Company has recorded a net deferred tax liability
pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109 note 7. The recorded
amount of $6,660,385 represents the net dollar denominated value of
amounts provided for temporary differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective Mexican tax basis.
Foreign Exchange Instruments
Effective January 1995, the Company adopted a policy of not engaging in
futures contracts with the purpose of hedging U.S. dollar/peso
revenues or costs, with the exception of regular treasury operations
to cover operating requirements for up to thirty days. The Company
had no open hedge contracts at December 31, 1997 or 1996. At December
31, 1994, the Company had an outstanding commitment to sell U.S.
dollars for Mexican  pesos.  The Company  realized a loss of
approximately $1,060,000 on this contract, which is recorded in cost
of sales and general and administrative expenses in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31,
1995.
Investment Security
The investment security at December 31, 1997 consisted of a Mexican bond
denominated in U.S. dollars issued by a Mexican bank maturing March
4, 2004. The Company classifies this investment as available for sale
in accordance with SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities. Accordingly, this security is recorded at
fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related
tax effect, are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate
component of stockholders' equity until realized. Realized gains and
losses are determined on a specific identification basis. A decline
in the market value of a security available for sale below cost that
is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in
carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings
and a new cost basis for the security is established. Premiums and
discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related
security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest
method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
using the first-in, first-out FIFO method. Inventory cost includes
material, labor, and overhead. Overhead content in ending inventory
at December 31, 1997 and 1996 was approximately $500,000 and
$451,000, respectively. Inventory reserves, which are charged to cost
of sales, are provided for excess inventory, obsolete inventory and
for differences between inventory cost and its net realizable value.                    27 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Plant and equipment under capital
leases are stated at the lower of their fair value at the inception
of the lease or the present value of minimum lease payments.
Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line
method over the shorter of related lease terms or estimated useful
lives of the assets. The policy of the Company is to charge amounts
expended for maintenance and repairs to expense and to capitalize
expenditures for major replacements and improvements.
Net Income per Share
Net income per share of common stock for the year ended December 31, 1997
and 1996 was calculated by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the year.
Net income per share of common stock for 1995 was calculated by dividing
net income by the number of common shares outstanding as of the
Effective Date, 5,000,000, after deducting amounts attributable to
the rights of senior securities of $226,438.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability
method, as required by SFAS 109. Under the asset and liability method
of SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial  statement  carrying  amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Under SFAS 109, the effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Provision for taxes are made based upon the applicable tax laws of
Mexico. In conformity with SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are not provided for differences related to assets and
liabilities that are remeasured from pesos into U.S. dollars using
historical exchange rates and that result from indexing for Mexican
purposes or exchange rate changes.
Revenue Recognition
Turnkey contract sales are recognized at the time the order is shipped.
Sales from contract assembly services are recognized over the
contract period and billed weekly as services are provided.
Employees' Statutory Profit Sharing
A  provision, when material, for deferred employees' statutory profit
sharing is computed on income subject to statutory profit sharing
which differs from net income, due to certain differences in the
recognition of income and expenses for statutory profit sharing and
book purposes.                    28 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued
Postretirement Benefits
Employees are entitled to certain benefits upon retirement after fifteen
years or more of service seniority premiums, in accordance with the
Mexican Federal Labor Law. The benefits are accrued as a liability
and recognized as expense during the year in which services are
rendered.
Fiscal Year
The Company uses thirteen-week quarters ending on a Sunday except that
the first quarter starts on January 1 and the fourth quarter ends on
December 31.
Financial Instruments
SFAS107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires
disclosures about the fair value of certain financial instruments for
which it is practicable to estimate that value. The fair value of a
financial instrument is generally the amount at which the instrument
could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties,
other than in a forced sale or liquidation.
The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, receivables, investment available for sale, accounts
payable, accrued expenses, taxes payable, and amounts due to related
parties, approximated fair value as of December 31, 1997 because of
the relatively short maturity of these instruments. Capital lease
obligations primarily represent obligations recorded at the present
value of the minimum lease payments, at the inception of the lease
agreement, in December 1997. Accordingly, the carrying value of
capital lease obligations approximated the fair value as of December
31, 1997.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of
The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 121, Accounting for Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, on
January 1, 1996. This Statement requires that long-lived assets and
certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. Assets to be disposed of are reported
at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
Adoption of this Statement did not have a material impact on the
Company financial position or results of its operations.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS 128, Earnings Per Share, which requires companies to present
basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share, instead of
the primary and fully diluted earnings per share that was required.
Adoption of SFAS 128 did not have an impact on previously reported
earnings per share.                    29 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued
New Accounting Pronouncements, Continued
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income,
which will be effective for the Company 1998 fiscal year. SFAS 130
establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its
components in the Company consolidated financial statements.
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, which establishes standards for
the way the Company reports information about operating segments in
the annual consolidated financial statements, as well as related
disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major
customers. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1997.
Year 2000
During 1997, the Company began a corporate-wide system conversion to a
software system that is Year 2000 compliant. The conversion will
cover all  significant  computer  applications of the Company.
Implementation of all systems is expected by September 1998. The Year
2000 issues are the result of computer programs being written using
two digits rather than four to define the applicable year. The
Company presently believes that, with the upgrades currently in
progress, the Year 2000 problem will not pose significant operational
problems.
Acquisitions
Effective July 1, 1997, the Company completed the acquisition of the
assets of Eurotech, S.A. de C.V. Eurotech for approximately
$3,900,000. Eurotech is a Mexican plastic molding and metal stamping
plant located in Cd. Juarez, Mexico. The acquisition of Eurotech has
been accounted for as a purchase. The acquisition price has been
allocated to tangible assets. The operating results of Eurotech have
been included in the Company consolidated financial statements
since the date of acquisition. The assets acquisition, if it had
occurred at the beginning of the year, would not have a material
effect on the consolidated financial statements.

some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
A reserve for certain deferred assets tax carryforwards of $211,534
and $458,747 has been provided at December 31, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. During the year ended December 31, 1996, a reserve was
recorded as a result of tax planning activities related to tax
reforms that provided increased net operating losses, but could also
result in possible loss of assets tax carryforwards.
The assets tax paid, adjusted for inflation, may be used to offset income
taxes that exceed the assets tax due for the year, for ten years
following the payment of the tax. These assets tax carryforwards as
of December 31, 1997 is $1,499,681 and expire from 1999 through 2007.                    35 7  Income Taxes, Continued

The Company has filed a consolidated tax return with its majority
stockholder since 1995. The tax sharing agreement entered into
between the majority stockholder, Accel S.A. de C.V., and Elamex
provides that Elamex will transfer monthly an amount equal to its
estimated payment, less credits, which would be required by the
Mexican tax authority calculated as if they were filing a separate
return for such year. The majority stockholder further agrees to
reimburse Elamex for use of any of Elamex tax benefits at the time
Elamex would otherwise realize the benefit.
Dividends paid by Mexican companies which exceed earnings and profits, as
defined by the Mexican tax law, are subject to a 34% income tax,
payable by the Company, on 1515 times the amount in excess of
earnings and profits. Dividends paid which do not exceed earnings and
profits are not currently subject to Mexican tax to either the
Company or the stockholder. The Mexican companies paid no dividends
on common stock in 1997, 1996, or 1995.
8  Redeemable Stock - Preferred and Common
An agreement  was  entered  into as part of a December 9, 1993
restructuring  whereby  Elamex was required,  if and when its
minority-held common stock was distributed to individuals,  to
repurchase up to 1,060,197 shares of common stock upon the death,
disability or, under certain  conditions,  upon an involuntary
termination of certain individuals. This agreement was formalized and
revised on March 9, 1995 whereby Elamex was obligated to repurchase
these shares of minority-held common stock over the next six years.
The repurchase of these redeemable shares was accelerated and by
September  1995,  all  minority  held stock was  purchased by
Internacional for $4,018,444, including redemption premiums. The
purchase of the minority held stock was paid for by a loan from
Elamex to Internacional of $1,300,016 and a capital contribution from
Accel to Internacional of $2,718,428.                    36 9  Stockholders' Equity
Common Stock
As part of the merger transaction between Internacional and Elamex on
October 1, 1995, the stock of Elamex, S.A. de C.V. was canceled and
replaced by 5,000,000 shares issued to Internacional stockholders
proportionate to their ownership interest; Internacional stock was
canceled. The merged corporation was organized under the laws of
Mexico as a sociedad anomina de capital variable.
On December 15, 1995, the stockholders of Elamex, S.A. de C.V., at a
special stockholders meeting, approved an amendment and restatement
of the bylaws of Elamex, S.A. de C.V. which included the following:
i elimination of par value of all shares; ii a transfer of all
the variable capital of Elamex, S.A. de C.V. to fixed capital
5,000,000 shares; iii authorization for issuance of up to
3,000,000 shares of common stock constituting fixed capital for the
offering, unsold shares of 600,000 were subsequently canceled; iv
authorization of 15,000,000 shares constituting variable capital
which will be held by Elamex, S.A. de C.V. as treasury stock and is
expected to be sold, from time to time, at the market price
prevailing at such time as authorized by the Board of Directors; v
and a provision requiring a motion at each annual stockholders'
meeting to allow the stockholders to designate up to 15% of each
year net profits as reserved for repurchase and cancellation of
publicly-traded common shares outstanding.
The Company designated $897,406 of 1995 net profits as a reserve for
the repurchase and cancellation of publicly-traded common shares
outstanding as approved by the Company stockholders.
Effective March 19, 1996, the Company completed a public offering of
2,400,000 shares of Class I, no par value, common stock for proceeds
of approximately $18,700,000, net of expenses of approximately
$2,800,000. The shares are traded on the NASDAQ National Market. The
common stock outstanding after the offering is 7,400,000 shares. Upon
completion  of the offering,  Accel  remained as the majority
stockholder;  accordingly,  Accel has the  ability to elect a
substantial majority of the Company directors, subject to certain
limitations, and will continue to control the Company.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997, a subsidiary of the Company
purchased 18,500 shares of the Company common stock in the open
market for an aggregate amount of $215,000. This treasury stock has
been presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at cost
as a reduction of stockholders' equity.                    37 9  Stockholders' Equity, Continued
Common Stock, Continued
Under the bylaws and Mexican law, the capital stock of Elamex, S.A. de
C.V. must consist of fixed capital and may have, in addition thereto,
variable capital. Stockholders holding shares representing variable
capital common stock may require the Company, with a notice of at
least three months prior to December 31 of the prior year, to redeem
those shares at a price equal to the lesser of either i 95% of the
market price, based on the average of trading prices in the stock
exchange where it is listed during the thirty trading days preceding
the end of the fiscal year in which the redemption is to become
effective or ii the book value of the Company shares as approved
at the meeting of stockholders for the latest fiscal year prior to
the redemption date. At December 31, 1997, the Company has not issued
any of its authorized variable capital common stock. Although the
variable capital common stock is redeemable by the terms described
above,  such shares  would be  classified  as a component of
stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Management
believes the variable common stock represents permanent capital
because the timing and pricing mechanisms through which a stockholder
would exercise the option to redeem are such that a stockholder, from
an economic standpoint, would not exercise this option. At the time a
stockholder is required to give notice of redemption, the stockholder
will not be able to know at what price the shares would be redeemed
and would not expect the present value of the future redemption
payment to equal or exceed the amount which would be received by the
stockholder in an immediate public sale.
Under Mexican Law, dividends must be declared in pesos. If dividends are
declared in the future, the Company intent is to pay the dividends
to all stockholders in U.S. dollars, as converted from pesos as of
the date of record, unless otherwise instructed by the stockholder.
Mexican Law requires that at least 5% of the Company net income each
year after profit sharing and other deductions required by law be
allocated to a legal reserve fund, which is not thereafter available
for distribution, except as a stock dividend, until the amount of
such fund equals 20% of the Company historical capital stock. The
legal reserve fund at December 31, 1997 and 1996 was approximately
$396,000  3,152,000  pesos and  $329,000  2,125,000  pesos,
respectively. The Company anticipates an additional allocation will
be made at its annual stockholders' meeting in April 1998 of
approximately $369,000 2,977,000 pesos. Retained earnings available
for dividends under Mexican law at December 31, 1997 were $19,615,784
158,182,000  pesos.  However,  debt agreements  place certain
restrictions on the payment of dividends note 5.                    38 9  Stockholders' Equity, Continued
Common Stock Purchase Restrictions and Preemptive Rights
Any person who seeks to acquire ownership of 15% or more of the total
outstanding shares of the Company common stock must receive written
consent from the Company Board of Directors. Should shares in
excess of 15% be acquired without permission, the purchaser will be
subject to liquidated damages which will be used by the Company to
repurchase stock in excess of the 15% ownership limitation. In
addition, in the event that the Company issues additional shares,
existing stockholders will have preemptive rights to subscribe for
new shares, except when shares are issued in connection with a merger
or for the conversion of convertible debentures. The 15,000,000
shares of variable capital authorized on December 15, 1995 are not
subject to preemptive rights.
Preferred Stock
As part of the December 15, 1995 amendment and restatement of the
Company  bylaws,  the Company Board of Directors,  at its
discretion, can issue up to an aggregate of 50,000,000 shares of
preferred stock in one or more series. The Board may attach any
preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations, and restrictions to
the shares of each series issued, including dividend rights and
rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, and
liquidation preferences. The shares may be issued at no par value or
at a par value determined by the Board of Directors. No shares of
preferred stock have been issued as of December 31, 1997.
10  Executive Phantom Stock Plan
During 1995, the Company adopted an Executive Phantom Stock Plan the
Plan which offers certain key executives of the Company and
related entities long-term incentives in addition to their current
compensation. Participants receive benefits expressed in shares of
common stock, but which are not actual shares of common stock
Phantom Stock Shares. A participant may exercise the right to
receive payment for Phantom Stock Shares two years after the
determination date as defined in the Plan; however, such shares
expire after ten years. Upon termination of employment for cause,
Phantom  Stock Shares and accrued  dividends and interest are
forfeited.
The Company keeps a record of the amount of Phantom Stock Shares held by
each participant. Each participant is credited with dollar amounts
equal to dividends paid on issued and outstanding common stock, and
such amounts accrue interest at the short-term money market rate
published by the Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. The Plan provides that
the number of Phantom Stock Shares awarded be determined by a
committee of the Board of Directors charged with administering the
Plan and the aggregate number of Phantom Stock Shares awarded for any
year shall in no event exceed 10% of the number of the Company
issued and outstanding common shares as of the end of such year. For
the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, the Company expensed
approximately $224,000 and $218,000, respectively, as obligations
under the Phantom Stock Plan.                    39 10  Executive Phantom Stock Plan, Continued

The Company has agreements that provide for the sale of its assembly
services and turnkey  manufacturing at established prices. The
Company business is dependent on one-to five-year agreements, which
are subject to termination or renewal.
Certain customers accounted for significant percentages of the Company

any significant changes with respect to sales since those customers
are expected to be replaced with new sales. Notwithstanding, the
termination of any of these agreements could have a material effect
on the Company financial position and results of operations.                    40 12  Related Party Transactions
The Company engages in various transactions in the ordinary course of
business with certain stockholders and other related parties. A
summary of significant related party transactions follows      o  As part of the reorganization and recapitalization discussed in
note 8, the  Company  issued  approximately  $2,045,000  of
subordinated debentures to certain stockholders of the Company in
1993. The principal was subject to acceleration under certain
circumstances, including a public offering of the Company common
stock. As a result, these subordinated debentures were paid-off
during the first quarter of 1996 with the net proceeds of the
public offering.
o  The Company leased a manufacturing facility from a stockholder,
which resulted in rent expense of approximately $88,000, and
$234,000 at December 31, 1996, and 1995, respectively. The
facility was not leased during 1997.
o  During May 1996, the Company exercised an option to purchase from
a related party two manufacturing facilities, located in Torreon
and Chihuahua, Mexico. In management opinion, the purchase price
of approximately $3,100,000 represents the fair market value as
determined by an independent appraiser.  The Company has a
manufacturing operation at the Torreon facility and intends to
establish an operation at the Chihuahua facility.
o  The Company leases three manufacturing facilities from companies
that are owned by a related party. Included in rent expense are
rental payments under these leases of approximately $831,000,
$900,000, and $833,000 during December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995,
respectively.
o  Elamex de Torreon, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican company owned by
affiliates of Elamex, exclusively provides assembly services under
the direction of Elamex to a customer of Elamex. Under a
manufacturing contract between Elamex and the Mexican company, the
Mexican company is required to submit its budget annually to the
Board of Directors of Elamex for approval. At December 31, 1997,
1996, and 1995, the Mexican company had sales to Elamex of
$1,731,000, $1,618,000, and $1,835,000, respectively. Elamex had a

o  A U.S. corporation, owned by certain executives and senior
management of the Company, exclusively provides professional
services to Elamex. Under the service agreement,  the U.S.
corporation is obligated to submit its annual budget to the Board

and $175,000 for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996, and

13  Commitments and Contingencies
The Company is a party to various claims, actions and complaints, the
ultimate disposition of which, in the opinion of management, will not
have a material adverse effect on the operations or financial
position of the Company.
The Mexican Federal Labor Law requires a severance payment for all
permanent employees that are terminated by the employer. This payment
is calculated on the basis of ninety days pay for termination anytime
during the first year of employment, with an additional twelve days
pay per year for each year of service thereafter. While most of the
Company Mexican assembly labor is hired under temporary labor
contracts during the first two months of employment, the labor force
is changed to permanent labor contracts after this period. The
Company has agreements with many of its contract-assembly customers
which require that the customers pay the severance costs incurred in
the event that assembly contracts are terminated prior to their
scheduled completion. In management opinion, any severance costs
incurred upon the termination of any manufacturing contracts would
not be material.
Seniority premiums to which employees are entitled upon retirement after
fifteen years or more of service, in accordance with the Mexican
Federal Labor Law, are recognized as expense during the year in which
services are rendered, based on actuarial computations. Included in
other liabilities is approximately $258,000 and $212,000 as of
December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively, which fully accrues for
these estimated seniority obligations. No significant seniority
payments have been made through December 31, 1997.
In January 1998, the Company agreed to purchase 2,525,000 shares of
Series A 9% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock Preferred
Stock of Optimag, Inc. Optimag, a California corporation. A
majority of the Board members of Optimag are Elamex directors.                    42                                
13  Commitments and Contingencies, Continued
Optimag was formed to develop, manufacture, and market optical inspection
stations and electrical test equipment to companies that produce disk
drive heads, magnetic media, and optical heads and optical media. The
Company has agreed to purchase the Preferred Stock in a three-part
transaction as follows      o  In January 1998, the Company signed the Preferred Stock Purchase
Agreement and purchased 637,500 shares of Preferred Stock for
$100 per share which are convertible into common stock 1 for 1.
o  If certain performance targets are met after 90 days of signing, 
the Company will purchase an additional 637,500 shares of 
Preferred Stock at $100 per share.
o  Upon final completion of a prototype inspection station, the
Company will purchase a final 1,250,000 shares of Preferred Stock
at $100 per share. After conversion to common stock, the Company
will own a minimum of 51% of the common stock.
The Company will consolidate operations of this investment.
At December 31, 1997, the Company has an obligation to purchase
inventory held by suppliers valued at approximately $1,280,000.
The Secretaria de Hacienda y Credito Publico Mexican tax authorities
has begun an examination of the Company 1996 federal tax return.
The examination could result in additional income tax being assessed
on the Company. Management does not believe the outcome of this
matter will have an adverse impact on the Company financial
position or results of operations.
