Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Crown Castle International Corp.: We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Crown Castle International Corp. and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2006 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss, cash flows, and
shareholders equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2007. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited financial statement schedule II. These consolidated
financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Crown Castle International Corp. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2006 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. As discussed in Notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial
statements, in 2005 the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement ObligationsAn Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.
Also, as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesAn
Interpretation of FASB Statement No109, effective January1, 2007. We also have audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, Crown Castle International Corp.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated February26, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting.  s/ KPMG LLP Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania February26,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts 
1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Crown Castle International Corp. CCIC and its majority and wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively referred to herein as the Company. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years financial statements to be consistent with the presentation in the current year. The Company has reclassified the
Corporate Office and Other segment and the Emerging Businesses segment into the CCUSA segment see note 18. The Company has reclassified corporate development expenses into general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of
operations and comprehensive income loss. The Company owns, operates and leases towers and other communications structures
collectively, towers. The Companys primary business is the renting of antenna space to wireless communications companies under long-term contracts. To a lesser extent, the Company also provides certain network services to its
customers, including initial antenna installation and subsequent augmentation, network design and site selection, site acquisition, site development, site management and other services. The Company conducts its operations through tower portfolios in
the United States U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada collectively referred to as CCUSA and Australia referred to as CCAL. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
On January12, 2007, the Company completed the merger Global Signal Merger of Global Signal Inc. with and into a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company see note 2. The results of operations from the former subsidiaries of Global Signal Inc. were included in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss beginning on January12, 2007. Unless
indicated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, Global Signal refers to the former Global Signal Inc. and its subsidiaries. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Restricted Cash Restricted cash
represents the cash held in reserve by the indenture trustees pursuant to the indenture governing the Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2005-1 2005 Tower Revenue Notes and the Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2006-1
2006 Tower Revenue Notes, and the loan agreements governing the Commercial Mortgage Pass-through Certificates, Series 2004-2 2004 Mortgage Loan and the Commercial Mortgage Pass-through Certificates, Series 2006-1
2006 Mortgage Loan. The restriction of all rental cash receipts is a critical feature of these debt instruments, due to the applicable indenture trustees ability to utilize the restricted cash for the payment of debt service
costs, ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes, insurance premiums related to towers, other assessments by governmental authorities and potential environmental remediation costs, and to reserve a portion of advance rents from
customers. The restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to the Company in accordance with the terms of the indentures. The increases and decreases in restricted cash have aspects of cash flows from financing as
well as cash flows from operating activities and, as such, could be classified as either on the statement of cash flows. The Company has classified these increases and decreases in restricted cash as cash flows from financing activities based on
consideration of the terms of the related indebtedness.

Index to Financial Statements NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable in order to present a net balance that the Company believes will be
collected. In estimating the appropriate balance for this allowance, the Company considers 1specific reserves for accounts it believes may prove to be uncollectible and 2additional reserves, based on historical collections, for the
remainder of its accounts. Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to costs of operations, and deductions from the allowance are recorded when specific accounts receivable are written off as uncollectible.
Investments in Equity Securities In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No115 SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, investments in equity securities classified
as available-for-sale are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. The net unrealized gains or losses on the available-for-sale securities, net of tax, are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss unless any losses
are deemed other than temporary. The Company periodically reviews the value of available-for-sale securities and records impairment charges in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss for any decline in value that is
determined to be other-than-temporary. The Company does not have any investments classified as trading. See note 6. Property and
Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed utilizing the
straight-line method at rates based upon the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets. Depreciation of towers is generally computed with a useful life equal to the shorter of 20 years or the term of the underlying ground lease
including optional renewal periods. Additions, renewals and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed. Upon the sale or retirement of an asset, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts and any gain or loss is recognized. The carrying value of property and equipment will be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If the sum
of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of an asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the
fair value of the asset. Asset Retirement Obligations The Company records obligations associated with retirement of long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No143 SFAS
143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations and Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No47 FIN 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. The fair value
of the liability for asset retirement obligations is recognized in the period in which it is incurred and the fair value of the liability can reasonably be estimated. Asset retirement obligations are included in other liabilities on the
Companys consolidated balance sheet. The liability accretes as a result of the passage of time and the related accretion expense is included in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense on the Companys consolidated
statement of operations and comprehensive income loss. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as an additional carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the useful life of the related long-lived asset.
Goodwill Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price for an acquired business over the allocated value of the related net assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment on an annual basis. This annual impairment test involves
1a step to identify potential impairment at a reporting unit level based on fair values and 2a step to measure the amount of the impairment, if any. The Companys measurement of the fair value for goodwill is based on an
estimate of discounted future cash flows of the reporting unit. Intangible Assets Intangible assets are included in other intangible assets, net on the Companys consolidated balance sheet and predominately consist of
the estimated fair value of the following items recorded in conjunction with acquisitions: 1in-place customer site rental contracts, 2below-market leases for land under its towers, 3term easement 
50 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts 
rights for land under its towers, and 4trademarks. Deferred credits related to above-market leases for land under its towers recorded in conjunction
with acquisitions are recorded at the estimated fair value and are included in other liabilities on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized utilizing the straight-line
method over their estimated useful lives. The carrying value of other intangible assets with finite useful lives will be reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of
an asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset. Deferred Financing Costs Costs incurred to obtain financing are deferred and amortized over the term
of the related borrowing. Deferred financing costs are included in deferred financing costs and other assets, net on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates The Company uses the cost method to account for investments in those entities where the Company owns less than twenty percent of the voting stock of the individual entity, does not exercise significant influence over the entity and is not
the primary beneficiary. The Company uses the equity method to account for investments in those entities where the Company does not have control or is not the primary beneficiary but has the ability to exercise significant influence over the entity.
The Company reviews investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be greater than the fair market value. If an evaluation was required, the carrying value of
the investment would be compared to the assets fair market value; and an impairment charge would be recorded to adjust the carrying value to the fair market value. See note 6. Accrued Property Taxes The accrual
for estimated property tax obligations are based on assessments currently in effect and estimates of possible additional taxes. The Company recognizes the benefit of tax appeals upon ultimate resolution of the appeal. Sale of Stock of Subsidiaries or Equity Method Investments The effects of any changes in the Companys ownership interests resulting from the issuance of equity capital by consolidated subsidiaries or investments accounted for under the equity method are accounted for as
capital transactions pursuant to the SECs Staff Accounting Bulletin No51 SAB 51, Accounting for the Sale of Stock of a Subsidiary. See note 6. Revenue Recognition Site rental
revenues are recognized on a monthly basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the relevant lease or agreement, with such terms generally ranging from five to ten years. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, including Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No13 SFAS 13, Accounting for Leases, these revenues are recognized on a monthly basis regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts. The
Companys leases contain fixed escalation clauses such as fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases or inflation-based escalation clauses such as those tied to the consumer price index CPI. If the payment terms call for fixed
escalations, the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the agreement. When calculating straight-line rental revenues, the Company considers all fixed elements of tenant leases
escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions also include a variable element. The Companys asset related to straight-line site rental revenues is included in deferred site rental receivables on the Companys
consolidated balance sheet. Network services revenues are generally recognized under a method which approximates the completed contract
method. This method is used because these services are typically completed in relatively short periods of time and financial position and results of operations do not vary significantly from those which would result from 
51 Table of Contents

use of the percentage-of-completion method. These services are considered complete when the terms and conditions of the contract or agreement have been
completed. Costs and revenues associated with contracts not complete at the end of a period are deferred and recognized when the installation becomes operational. The Company typically bills for installation services on a fixed price basis. Any
losses on contracts are recognized at such time as they become known. Some of the Companys arrangements with its customers call for
the performance of multiple revenue-generating activities. Generally, these arrangements include both site rental and network services. In such cases, the Company determines whether the multiple deliverables are to be accounted for separately or on
a combined basis. In order to be accounted for separately, the undelivered items must 1have stand-alone value to the customer, 2have reliably determinable fair value on a separate basis, and 3have delivery which is probable
and under the control of the Company. In addition, the delivered item must have stand-alone value to the customer. Allocation of recognized revenue in such arrangements is based on the relative fair value of the separately delivered items.
Sales taxes and value-added taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis.
Costs of Operations Costs of operations consist primarily of ground leases, repairs and maintenance, utilities, property taxes, employee compensation and related benefit costs, insurance and monitoring costs. Generally, the ground lease agreements are specific
to each site and are for an initial term of five years and are renewable for pre-determined periods. Ground lease expense is recognized on a monthly basis, regardless of whether the lease agreement payment terms require the Company to make payments
annually, quarterly, or in equal monthly amounts. The Companys ground leases contain fixed escalation clauses such as fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases or inflation-based escalation clauses such as those tied to the CPI. If the
payment terms include fixed escalation provisions, the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company calculates the straight-line ground lease expense using a time period that equals or exceeds the remaining
depreciable life of the tower asset. Further, when a tenant has exercisable renewal options that would compel the Company to exercise existing ground lease renewal options, the Company has straight-lined the ground lease expense over a sufficient
portion of such ground lease renewals to coincide with the final termination of the tenants renewal options. The Companys liability related to straight-line ground lease expense is included in deferred ground lease payables
on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Non-Cash Site Rental Margin The following is a summary of the impact on site rental gross margins from the non-cash portions of site rental revenues, ground lease expense and
stock-based compensation expense for those employees directly related to CCUSA tower operations and the amortization of below-market and above-market leases.

Costs that do not meet the above criteria are expensed as incurred. Certain incremental costs that
are expensed as incurred are classified as integration costs in the Companys consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss, including retention bonuses paid to employees of an acquired enterprise, contracted employees to
assist with the integration of the acquired enterprises operations and tower portfolio, travel costs incurred directly related to the integration of the acquired enterprises operations and tower portfolio, and certain other costs
directly related to the integration of the acquired enterprise. Internal costs, both one-time and recurring in nature, are not included in the cost of the acquired enterprise, whether or not the costs are incremental, non-recurring or related
directly to a business combination. Costs of registering and issuing equity securities in a business combination are treated as a
reduction of the fair value of equivalent registered securities issued. Stock-Based Compensation On January1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Share-Based Payment SFAS
123R revised 2004 using the modified prospective method. SFAS 123R requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. In March
2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No107 SAB 107 relating to the application of SFAS 123R. The Company has applied the provisions of SAB 107 in its adoption of SFAS 123R. Prior to adopting SFAS 123R, the
Company had applied the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123 SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, using the prospective method
of transition under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No148 SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure. The adoption of SFAS 123R increased the Companys stock-based
compensation expense by $04 million for the year ending December31, 2006. Restricted Stock Awards. The Company records
stock-based compensation expense only for those nonvested stock awards restricted stock awards for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered. The Company uses historical data and managements judgment about the future
employee turnover rates to estimate the number of shares for which the requisite service period will not be rendered. The fair value of restricted stock awards without market conditions is determined based on the number of shares granted and the
quoted price of the Companys stock at the date of grant. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company began using a Monte Carlo simulation as the method of valuation for the Companys restricted stock awards with market conditions. The
Companys determination of the fair value of restricted stock awards with market conditions on the date of grant is affected by its stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. Although the
fair value of restricted stock awards with market conditions is determined in accordance with SFAS 123R and SAB 107, a Monte Carlo simulation requires the input of highly subjective assumptions; and other reasonable assumptions could provide
differing results. The key assumptions are summarized as follows: Valuation and Amortization Method. The Company estimates the fair
value of restricted stock awards with market conditions granted using a Monte Carlo simulation. It amortizes the fair value of all restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis for each separately vesting tranche of the award graded vesting
schedule over the requisite service periods. In the case of accelerated vesting based on the market performance of the Companys common stock, the compensation costs related to the vested awards that have not previously been amortized are
recognized upon vesting. Expected Volatility. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock at the date of grant based on
the historical volatility of its common stock and implied volatility on publicly traded options on the Companys common stock. Risk-Free Rate. The Company bases the risk-free rate used in the Monte Carlo simulation on implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury issues with an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award.

Interest Expense and Amortization of Deferred Financing Costs Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs as presented on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss
consists of 1interest expense on various debt obligations, 2the amortization of deferred financing costs over the term of the related borrowing, 3the amortization of interest rate swaps from accumulated other comprehensive
income loss in the period the hedged item effects earnings, 4amortization of debt purchase price adjustments, and 5non-cash imputed interest on the financing provided by a customer in exchange for an initial rent-free period and is
reduced by interest capitalized to construction in-process related to the build-out of the former Modeo network see note 17. The significant components of interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs are as follows:  Years Ended December31 2005

been recognized in the Companys financial statements or tax returns. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. The Company records interest or penalties related to income taxes as components of
the benefit provision for income taxes in its consolidated financial statements. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December31, 2007 is immaterial. The company recognizes a tax position if it is more likely than not it will be sustained upon examination. The tax position is measured at the largest
amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. See notes 1 discussed further herein below and 8 for a discussion of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No48

Companys international operations use the local currency as their functional currency. The Company translates the results of these international operations using the applicable average exchange rate for the period, and translates the assets
and liabilities using the applicable exchange rate at the end of the period. The cumulative effect of changes in the exchange rate is recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income loss.

Derivative Instruments The Company utilizes interest rate swaps, to manage and reduce its interest rate risk. Derivative financial instruments are entered into for periods that
match the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of these exposures. The Company can designate derivative financial instruments as hedges. The Company can also enter into derivative financial instruments that are
not designated as accounting hedges. Derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a
cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity, captioned accumulated other comprehensive income loss, and recognized as
increases or decreases to interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs when the hedged item affects earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is included in interest and other income expense on the consolidated
statement of operations and comprehensive income loss. Derivatives that do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting are marked to market through interest and other income expense on the consolidated statement of operations and
comprehensive income loss. To qualify for hedge accounting, the details of the hedging relationship must be formally documented at the
inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risks that are being hedged, the derivative instrument, how effectiveness is being assessed and how ineffectiveness will be measured. The
derivative must be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows for the risk being hedged. In the context of hedging relationships, effectiveness refers to the degree to which fair value changes in the hedging instrument offset the
corresponding expected earnings effects of the hedged item. The Company assesses the effectiveness of hedging relationships both at the inception of the hedge and on an on-going basis. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash approximates fair value for these instruments. The estimated fair value of available-for-sale securities is based on quoted market prices. The estimated fair value of the
Companys public debt securities is based on quoted market prices, and the estimated fair value of the other long-term debt is determined based on the current rates offered for similar borrowings. The estimated fair value of the interest rate
swaps are based on the amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the agreement at the balance sheet date. The estimated fair values of the Companys financial instruments, along with the carrying amounts of the related assets
liabilities, are as follows:  December31, 2006 December31, 2007 CarryingAmount FairValue CarryingAmount FairValue Cash and cash equivalents 592,716 592,716 75,245 75,245 Restricted cash 120,503 120,503 170,556 170,556 Available-for-sale securities 154,955 154,955 60,085 60,085 Short-term and long-term debt 3,513,890 3,585,806 6,069,195 6,127,887 Interest rate swaps, net 2,200 2,200 65,341 65,341
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 requires that the Company recognize in its
financial statements the impact of a tax position if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective as of the beginning of the
Companys 2007 fiscal year with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening accumulated deficit. The Company adopted FIN 48 on January1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 resulted in a
decrease in accumulated deficit and a decrease in contingent tax liabilities through a cumulative effect adjustment of $47 million. See note 8. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No157 SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally
accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The FASB amended SFAS 157 to exclude leases accounted for pursuant to SFAS 13 from its scope. SFAS 157 is effective for the Company on 
56 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts 
January1, 2008, with the exception of a one-year deferral of implementation for certain non-financial assets and liabilities. The requirements of SFAS
157 will be applied prospectively except for certain derivative instruments that, if applicable, would be adjusted through the opening balance of accumulated deficit in the period of adoption. The Company believes the adoption of SFAS 157 will not
have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No108 SAB 108, which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. SAB 108 requires the use
of both the iron curtain and rollover approach in quantifying the materiality of misstatements. SAB 108 provided transitional guidance for the correction of errors in prior periods. The Company adopted SAB 108 as of
September30, 2006. Upon initial application of SAB 108, the Company evaluated the uncorrected financial statement misstatements that were previously considered immaterial under the rollover method using the dual methodology
required by SAB 108. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In
February 2007, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No159 SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS 159
permits an entity to elect to measure eligible items at fair value fair value option, including many financial instruments. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate
volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. This Statement is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement, which is consistent
with FASBs long-term measurement objectives for accounting for financing instruments The provisions of SFAS 159 are effective for the Company as of January1, 2008. If the fair value option is elected, the Company will report unrealized
gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. Upfront costs and fees related to items for which the fair value option is elected shall be recognized in earnings as incurred
and not deferred. The fair value option may be applied for a single eligible item without electing it for other identical items, with certain exceptions, and must be applied to the entire eligible item and not to a portion of the eligible. The
Company did not elect the fair value option on January1, 2008. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No160 SFAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan Amendment to Accounting Research Bulletin No51. SFAS 160 amends Accounting Research
BulletinNo51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership
interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the
noncontrolling interest. The provisions of SFAS 160 are effective for the Company as of January1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS 160 on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141R, Business Combinations revised 2007. SFAS 141R replaces Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No141 SFAS 141, Business Combinations. SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling
interest in an acquisition, at their fair value as of the acquisition date. SFAS 141R will change the accounting treatment of certain items, including 1acquisition and restructuring costs will be generally expensed as incurred,
2noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date, 3acquired contingent liabilities will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or
the amount determined under existing guidance for non-acquired contingencies, and 4changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will affect provision for income taxes. The
provisions of SFAS 141R will be applied prospectively to the Companys business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS 141R on
its consolidated financial statements.

2. Acquisition The following is a summary of the Companys acquisitions during the years ended December31, 2005, 2006 and 2007. The Company entered into these acquisitions and paid purchase prices that resulted in the
recognition of goodwill primarily because of the anticipated growth opportunities in the tower portfolios. Purchase of Trintel Assets
On July11, 2005, the Company signed a definitive agreement to purchase 467 towers from affiliates of Trintel Communications, Inc.
Trintel for approximately $1450 million. On August1, 2005, the Company completed the purchase of the Trintel towers. The allocation of the purchase price included $1368 million to property and equipment and $82 million to
goodwill. The results of operations from the towers acquired from Trintel have been included in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss from August1, 2005. The Company funded the acquisition entirely through
borrowings under the previously existing 2005 Credit Facility as defined in note 7. Mountain Union Acquisition On July1, 2006, the Company acquired approximately 98% of the outstanding equity interests of Mountain Union Telecom, LLC Mountain
Union for $3053 million. Mountain Unions assets at closing included 474 completed towers, as well as 77 towers in various stages of development. The results of operations from the towers acquired from Mountain Union have been included
in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss from July1, 2006. The Company utilized borrowings under the previously existing 2006 Credit Facility as defined in note 7 to acquire the Mountain Union equity
interests and pay off the outstanding indebtedness of Mountain Union. On January2, 2007, the Company purchased the remaining minority interest in Mountain Union for $44 million. The following is the allocation of the purchase price to acquire 100% of Mountain Union.  Cash and cash equivalents 1,647 Other current assets 1,872 Property and equipment 89,784 Goodwill 50,519 Other intangible assets 170,200 Other assets 283 Deferred rental revenues and other accrued liabilities 3,603 Other liabilities 1,021 309,681 Global Signal Acquisition On October5, 2006, the Company entered into a merger agreement which contemplated Global Signal merging into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company. On January12, 2007, the Global Signal Merger was completed for a purchase price of approximately $40 billion, exclusive of debt of approximately $18 billion that remained outstanding as obligations following the Global Signal
Merger. The Company entered into the Global Signal Merger and paid a purchase price that resulted in the recognition of goodwill primarily because of anticipated growth opportunities in the tower portfolio, including through leveraging the
Companys management team and customer service across an enhanced national footprint. The results of operations from Global Signal have been included in the consolidated statements of operations from January12, 2007. In connection with the Global Signal Merger, each outstanding share of common stock of Global Signal was converted into the right to receive, at the
election of the holder thereof, either 161 shares of the Companys common stock or $5595 in cash. In addition, in connection with the Global Signal Merger, the obligation pursuant to each warrant GSI Warrants entitling the
holder thereof to purchase shares of Global Signal common stock was assumed by the Company with appropriate adjustments made to the number of shares and exercise price per share. Accordingly, each such warrant entitled the holder thereof to purchase
322 shares of the Companys common stock.

As a result of the Global Signal Merger, the Company issued approximately 981million shares of common stock to the stockholders of Global Signal and
paid the maximum $5500 million in cash GS $550M Consideration and reserved for issuance approximately 06million shares of common stock issuable pursuant to warrants described above see note 11. The Company primarily financed
the GS $550M Consideration with cash obtained from the issuance of the 2006 Tower Revenue Notes in November 2006. At the closing of the Global Signal Merger, Global Signals subsidiaries had debt outstanding of approximately $18 billion, which
has a structure similar to the 2005 Tower Revenue Notes and the 2006 Tower Revenue Notes see note 7. The purchase price of approximately
$40 billion includes the fair value of common stock issued, the GS $550M Consideration, the fair value of the GSI Warrants and restricted stock awards assumed and estimated transaction costs. The components of the purchase price are as follows:
Issuance of common stock to stockholders of Global Signal 981 million shares at $3420 3,353,275
GS $550M Consideration 550,013
Fair value of warrants assumed 18,392
Fair value of restricted stock awards assumed 2,240
Transaction costs 31,500 Total purchase price 3,955,420 The fair value of the common stock and restricted stock awards issued was determined using a value
of $3420 per share which represents the average closing price of the Companys common stock for the five-day period comprised of the two days prior to, the day of and the two days subsequent to the date of the merger agreement October 4,
2006. The fair value of the warrants was determined using a Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Through the Global Signal Merger, the
Company acquired 10,749 towers including 6,553 towers Sprint Towers leased including managed through May 2037, which are accounted for as capital leases, under master leases and subleases Sprint Master Leases with
Sprint Corporation a predecessor of Sprint Nextel and certain Sprint Corporation subsidiaries entered into in May 2005. Global Signal prepaid the rent owed under the Sprint Master Leases in May 2005. During the period commencing one year prior to
the expiration of the Sprint Master Leases and ending 120 days prior to expiration, the Company, after the Global Signal Merger, has the option to purchase all but not less than all of the Sprint Towers then leased for approximately $23 billion.
Following the Global Signal Merger, the Company is entitled to all revenues from the Sprint Towers during the term of the Sprint Master Leases, including amounts payable under existing leases with third parties. In addition, under the Sprint Master
Leases, certain Sprint Corporation subsidiaries have agreed to sublease space on substantially all of the Sprint Towers for an initial period through May 2015. The Sprint Master Leases remain effective as assets and commitments following the closing
of the Global Signal Merger.

the 2007 Revolver, elimination of the covenants that require compliance with certain financial ratios. In March 2007, CCOC entered into an amendment to the 2007 Joinder A pursuant to which the lenders agreed to amend certain terms applicable to the
2007 Term Loan A including 1a reduction in the interest rate margins applicable to the Term Loan A and 2an extension of the maturity date of the 2007 Term Loan A from January25, 2014, to March6, 2014. On March6,

See note 22. Securitized Debt The 2004 Mortgage Loan, 2006 Mortgage Loan, Tower Revenue Notes collectively, Securitized Debt are obligations of special purposes entities and their direct and indirect subsidiaries each an issuer all of which
are wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company. The 2004 Mortgage Loan, 2006 Mortgage Loan and Tower Revenue Notes are governed by separate indentures and each consists of separate classes with each class subordinated in right of payment to
any other class issued under the respective indenture which has an earlier alphabetical designation. The Tower Revenue Notes are governed by one indenture and each class ranks pari passu with each class that bears the same alphabetical designation.
Interest is paid monthly on the Securitized Debt. 
64 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts 
The Securitized Debt is paid solely from the cash flows generated by the operation of the towers held
directly and indirectly by the issuers of the respective Securitized Debt. The Securitized Debt is secured by, among other things, 1a security interest in substantially all of the applicable issuers personal property and 2a
pledge of the equity interests in each applicable issuer. The Mortgage Loans are also secured by mortgage liens on the interest fee, leasehold or easement in the issuers towers. The Tower Revenue Notes are also secured by a security interest
in the applicable issuers contracts with customers to lease space on their towers space licenses. The governing instruments of two indirect subsidiaries Crown Atlantic and Crown GT of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes
generally prevent them from issuing debt and granting liens on their assets without the approval of a subsidiary of Verizon Communications. Consequently, while distributions paid by Crown Atlantic and Crown GT will service the Tower Revenue Notes,
the Tower Revenue Notes are not obligations of, nor are the Tower Revenue Notes secured by the cash flows or any other assets of, Crown Atlantic and Crown GT. As of December31, 2007, the Securitized Debt was collateralized with property and
equipment with a net book value of an aggregate approximately $18 billion, exclusive of Crown Atlantic and Crown GT property and equipment. The excess cash flows from the issuers of the Securitized Debt, after the payment of principal, interest, reserves and expenses, are distributed to the Company in accordance with the terms of the indentures. If the Debt Service Coverage
Ratio DSCR as defined in the applicable governing loan agreement as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to a certain level, then all excess cash flow of the issuers of the applicable debt instrument will be deposited into a
reserve account instead of being released to the Company. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the Company until the DSCR exceeds a certian level for two consecutive calendar quarters. If the DSCR falls below a certian level as
of the end of any calendar quarter, then all funds on deposit in the reserve account along with future excess cash flows of the issuers will be applied to prepay the debt with applicable prepayment consideration. The Company may not prepay the Securitized Debt in whole or in part at any time prior to the second anniversary of the closing date, except in limited
circumstances such as the occurrence of certain casualty and condemnation events relating to the towers securing the Securitized Debt. Thereafter, prepayment is permitted provided it is accompanied by any applicable prepayment consideration.
The Securitized Debt has covenants and restrictions customary for rated securitizations including prohibiting the issuers from incurring
additional indebtedness or further encumbering their assets. Derivative Instruments Between Indenture Trustee and Noteholders. Swap
contracts are in place on the ClassA FL of both the 2005 Tower Revenue Notes and 2006 Tower Revenue Notes, having Initial Principal Balances of $2500 million and $1700million, respectively. The swap contracts are between the
indenture trustee and Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc. and were entered into to provide investors a floating rate note alternative, via exchanging a fixed rate paid by the Company into a floating rate coupon for investors. The Company is not
party to the swap contracts and has no obligations under the swap contracts; rather, the Companys obligation for interest relating to the ClassA FL of the Tower Revenue Notes is the same as the ClassA FX of the Tower
Revenue Notes. Convertible Debt and Other 4% Convertible Senior Notes. In 2003, the Company issued $2300 million aggregate principal amount of its 4% Convertible Senior Notes for proceeds of $2231 million after underwriting discounts of $69

stock. The 4% Convertible Senior Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, on or after July18, 2008 at
a price of 10114% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The redemption price is reduced to 10057% on July15, 2009. The 4% Convertible Senior Notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, in whole or in part at any time, into
shares of common stock at a conversion price of $1083 per share of common stock. As of December31, 2007, conversion of all the outstanding 4% Convertible Senior Notes would result in the issuance of approximately 59million shares of

2006, the Company de-designated this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge and terminated the swap. The increase in the fair value from January27, 2006 to the date of de-designation totaled $62 million and was recorded as a net change in
fair value of cash flow hedging instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income loss. As a result of the de-designation, $07 million previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of the date of the de-designation
was reclassified into income during 2006. The remaining $55 million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as of the date of de-designation is amortized as a decrease to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over a
five year period through November 2011, the anticipated repayment date of the 2006 Tower Revenue Notes. f
The termination of the interest rate swap resulted in a $57 million settlement payment by the Company, of which $56 million is included in accumulated other comprehensive income
loss and is amortized as a decrease to interest expense. g
The termination of the interest rate swap resulted in a $95 million settlement payment by the Company, of which $93 million is included in accumulated other comprehensive income
loss and is amortized as a decrease to interest expense. h
The effective interest rate on the 2006 Tower Revenue Notes is approximately 58%, inclusive of the approximate 01% increase in the effective interest rate relating to the
termination of these interest rate swaps. The estimated amortization into interest expense as a result of termination of these interest rate swaps is a net expense of $19 million for the year ended December31, 2008. 
The following is a summary of the outstanding interest rate swaps as of December31, 2007. The fair value of the interest rate swaps as of
December31, 2007 is included in other liabilities and other accrued liabilities on the Companys consolidated balance sheet.  Hedged Item

Income Taxes Income loss from continuing operations before income taxes, minority interests and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle by geographic area is as follows:  Years Ended December31 2005 2006 2007 Domestic 383,187 43,201 307,953 Foreign 8,856 5,172 9,050 392,043 48,373 317,003 The benefit provision for income taxes consists of the following:  Years Ended December31 2005 2006 2007 Current Federal 2,003 1,535 Foreign 521 378 1,583 State 1,085 765 1,757 Deferred Federal 97,763 State 1,619 2,303 1,151 3,225 843 94,039 For the years ended December31, 2006 and 2007, the Company incurred $21 million and $05
million of alternative minimum tax liability and recognized the related alternative minimum tax carryforward. The alternative minimum tax credit has an indefinite carryforward period. A reconciliation between the benefit provision for income taxes and the amount computed by applying the federal statutory income tax rate to the loss
from continuing operations before income taxes is as follows:  Years Ended December31 2005 2006 2007 Benefit for income taxes at statutory rate 137,215 16,931 110,951 Tax effect of foreign losses 3,100 1,810 3,168 Expenses for which no federal tax benefit was recognized 1,842 1,737 742 Losses for which no tax benefit was recognized 132,273 12,311 8,373 State tax provision benefit 2,704 1,538 606 Foreign tax 521 378 1,583 Other 2,440 3,225 843 94,039

The components of the net deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows:  December31 2006 2007 Deferred income tax liabilities Property and equipment 337,684 497,274 Deferred site rental receivable 41,426 56,084 Available-for-sale securities 24,831 Intangible assets 762,486 Total deferred income tax liabilities 403,941 1,315,844 Deferred income tax assets Net operating loss carryforwards 503,704 660,284 Deferred ground lease payable 52,192 68,611 Alternate minimum tax credit carryforward 18,603 14,666 Accrued liabilities 27,857 50,356 Receivables allowance 1,298 2,604 Prepaid lease 464,834 Derivative instruments 3,859 26,442 Available-for-sale securities 8,373 Intangible assets 76,369 Valuation allowances 279,257 148,093 Total deferred income tax assets, net 404,625 1,148,077 Net deferred income tax asset liabilities 684 167,767 Valuation allowances of $2793 million and $1481 million were recognized to offset net deferred
income tax assets as of December31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. The valuation allowance as of December31, 2007 predominately related to foreign and state net deferred tax assets. If the benefits related to the valuation allowance are
recognized in the future, substantially all of the benefits would be allocated to the consolidated statement of operations in the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December31, 2007, the Company had U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $16 billion, $12 billion
and $01 billion, respectively, which are available to offset future taxable income. The federal loss carryforwards will expire in 2021 through 2026. The state net operating loss carryforwards expire in 2015 through 2026. The foreign net operating
loss carryforwards predominately remain available indefinitely provided certain continuity of business requirements are met. The utilization of the loss carryforwards is subject to certain limitations. The Companys U.S. federal and state
income tax returns generally remain open to examination by taxing authorities until three years after the applicable loss carryforwards have been used or expired. As discussed in note 1, the Company adopted FIN 48 on January1, 2007. Upon adoption of FIN 48, the Company recorded 1a decrease to its tax liabilities related to previously unrecorded tax benefits as an
adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit of $47 million and 2an increase to its deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance of $749 million related to previously unrecognized tax benefits. As of both the adoption of
FIN 48 and December31, 2007, the Company had $749 million of unrecognized tax benefits. On January12, 2007, the Company
recorded deferred tax liabilities of $5566 million in connection with the purchase accounting related to the Global Signal Merger. Additionally, as a result of recording this deferred tax liability, the Company reversed $2597 million of its
federal deferred tax valuation allowance in purchase accounting with an offsetting adjustment to predominately decrease goodwill arising from the Global Signal Merger. From time to time, the Company is subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which the Company has significant business operations. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of
additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. During 2007, the Internal Revenue Service IRS commenced examination of the Companys U.S. federal income tax return for 2004. Based on
discussions with the IRS, the Company determined it had incorrectly recorded the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting in 2004 
70 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts 
and 2005. The Companys net federal deferred tax assets for all periods prior to 2007 had been fully reserved, due to its historical tax loss position
and uncertainty about the ultimate realizability of the Companys net deferred tax assets. As a result, the adjustment to correct the federal deferred tax assets recorded in 2004 and 2005 impacted only the disclosure of the components of
the net deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the footnotes to the Companys consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 and not the benefit provision for income taxes in
the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The impact of the adjustment to the components of the net deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December31, 2006 is reflected herein. During 2007, the
Company reversed its federal valuation allowance with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in conjunction with recording net deferred tax liabilities in purchase accounting for the Global Signal Merger see note 2. Consequently, the impact of the
adjustment to the Companys deferred tax assets resulted in the Company recording a $199 million increase to net deferred tax liabilities with a corresponding increase to goodwill, which was reflected in the $2597 million reversal of the
Companys federal tax valuation allowance in purchase accounting. Upon completion of this examination, which is expected to occur
during calendar 2008, the $749 million of unrecognized benefits will change. Any adjustment to the unrecognized tax benefits, which cannot yet be estimated, will impact the benefit provision for income taxes. The Company does not expect to make a
significant cash payment as a result of any adjustment from the finalization of this examination. 9. Minority Interests Minority interests primarily represent the minority shareholders 224% interests in CCAL, the Companys 776% majority-owned subsidiary, and
the minority shareholders approximately 2% interests in Mountain Union from July1, 2006 to January2, 2007. In May 2007, CCAL issued a capital return of approximately $1660 million, including $372 million to the minority
shareholders of CCAL. Upon issuance of the capital return, the Company recorded a reduction in additional paid-in capital of $89 million as a result of the capital return to the CCAL minority shareholders exceeding the carrying value of the
minority interests in CCAL. The income or losses applicable to the minority shareholders of CCAL are included in the Companys results as long as their share of the CCAL cumulative losses exceeds their equity interests. 10. Redeemable Preferred Stock Redeemable preferred
stock consists of the following:  December31 2006
2007
625% Convertible Preferred Stock 312,871 313,798
625% Convertible Preferred Stock The Company originally issued 81million shares of its 625% Convertible Preferred Stock at a price of $5000 per share the liquidation preference
per share. The holders of the 625% Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 625%per annum payable on February15,May15,August15 and November15 of each year.
The Company has the option to pay dividends in cash or in shares of its common stock. For the years ended December31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, dividends were paid with 106million, -0- and -0- shares of common stock, respectively,
and in addition 2approximately $99 million, $199 million and $199 million of cash for 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. The amortization of the issue costs on the 625% Convertible Preferred Stock to dividends on preferred stock,
net of losses on purchases of preferred stock, was $09 million for each of years ended December31, 2005, 2006 and 2007. The Company is required to redeem all outstanding shares of the 625% Convertible Preferred Stock on August15,
2012 at a price equal to the liquidation preference plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. The shares of 625% Convertible Preferred Stock
are convertible, at the option of the holder, in whole or in part at any time, into shares of the Companys common stock at a conversion price of $36875 per share of common stock. Under certain circumstances, the Company generally has the
right to convert the 625% Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into 86million shares of common stock, if the price per share of the Companys common stock equals or exceeds 120% of the conversion price or $4425 for at
least 20 trading days in any consecutive 30-day trading period.

The Companys obligations with respect to the 625% Convertible Preferred Stock are subordinate
to all indebtedness of the Company and are effectively subordinate to all debt and liabilities of the Companys subsidiaries. 81/4% Convertible Preferred Stock The Company
originally issued 02million shares of its 81/4% Convertible Preferred Stock at a price of $1,000 per share the
liquidation preference per share to General Electric Capital Corporation GECC. While the 81/4% Convertible
Preferred Stock was outstanding, GECC was entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 81/4%per annum, and the
Company had the option to pay such dividends in cash or in shares of its common stock. On November30, 2005, the Company exercised its redemption right for the 81/4
% Convertible Preferred Stock. On December16, 2005, the Company redeemed its 81/4% Convertible Preferred Stock for $2041 million in cash, including accrued interest of $41 million. The redemption resulted in losses of $120 million for the year ended December31, 2005, consisting of the write-off of deferred
financing costs included in additional paid-in capital $94 million and the excess of the total purchase price over the carrying value of the 81/4% Convertible Preferred Stock $26 million. Such loss is included in dividends on preferred stock, net of losses on purchases of preferred stock on the Companys consolidated statement of income and
comprehensive income loss for the year ended December31, 2005. The redemption eliminated the potential future conversion of the 81/4% Convertible Preferred Stock into 74million shares of common stock. For the year ended December31, 2005, dividends on the Companys 81/4% Convertible Preferred Stock were paid with 02million shares of common stock and approximately $124 million in cash. The
Company purchased the 02million shares of common stock from the dividend paying agent for a total of $41 million in cash. For the year ended December31, 2005, the amortization of the discount on the 81
/4% Convertible Preferred Stock to dividends on preferred stock, net of losses on purchases of preferred stock was $04 million.
11. Stockholders Equity Purchases of the Companys Common Stock In 2005, the Company purchased 154million shares of common stock in
public market transactions, utilizing $2983 million in cash to affect these purchases. In 2006, the Company purchased 159million shares of common stock in public market transactions, utilizing $5180 million in cash to affect these

purchased 32million shares of common stock in public market transactions, utilizing $1260 million in cash to effect these purchases. The Company may choose to continue to purchase its common stock in the future.

shares added shall not exceed 100million shares. Pursuant to this provision, in 2005, 2006 and 2007, the Company transferred 52million shares, 05million shares and less than 01million shares, respectively, from the Crown
Castle International Corp. 1995 Stock Option Plan to the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan. Pursuant to these plans, the Company granted
restricted stock awards to certain executives and employees beginning in 2003. The restricted stock awards vest over periods of up to five years. The Companys performance restricted stock awards have provisions for accelerated vesting based on
the market performance of its common stock. Some of the restricted stock awards have provisions for forfeiture by the employee if certain market performance of the Companys common stock is not achieved. The Company has not granted CCIC stock
options since 2003 and has not granted options to the executive management since October 2001. In addition, CCAL may award options to its

The performance restricted stock awards granted in 2007 contain provisions for accelerated vesting
based on the market performance of the Companys common stock. In order to reach the first level for accelerated vesting of these restricted shares, the market price of the Companys common stock would have to close at or above $3968 per
share for 20 consecutive trading days. Reaching the first target level would result in the restrictions expiring with respect to one-third of these restricted shares. In order to reach the second and third target levels for accelerated vesting of
these restricted shares, the market price of the common stock would have to close at or above $4563 per share and $5247 per share, respectively 115% of each of the previous target levels, for 20 consecutive trading days. Reaching each of the
second and third target levels would result in the restrictions expiring with respect to an additional one-third of these restricted shares respectively. The performance restricted stock awards to executives also contain provisions that result in
forfeiture by the employee of any unvested shares in the event the Companys common stock does not achieve the target of $4140 per share for 20 consecutive trading days which include any dates on or before February22, 2011. The
integration restricted stock awards were granted to executives and employees deemed to be integral to the successful integration of Global Signal. The integration restricted stock awards contain provisions that result in forfeiture by the employee
of any unvested shares in the event the Companys common stock does not achieve the market performance target of $4450 per share for 20 consecutive trading days which include any dates on or between July1, 2008 and December31,
2008. However, to the extent that the requisite service period is rendered, compensation cost for accounting purposes will not be reversed for either performance restricted stock awards or the integration restricted stock awards; rather, it will be
recognized regardless of whether or not the market performance targets are achieved. For the years ended December31, 2005 and 2006,
the Company granted 08million shares and 12million shares, respectively, of restricted stock awards to the Companys executives and certain other employees. The weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of the grants for
the years ended December31, 2005 and 2006 was $1676 and $2363 per share, respectively. The performance restricted stock awards granted during 2005 and 2006 contain provisions for accelerated vesting based on the market performance of the
Companys common stock. All of the performance awards granted in 2005 and the first one-third of the performance awards granted in 2006 have accelerated vested. In order to reach the second and third target levels for accelerated vesting of an
additional one-third of the restricted stock awards granted in 2006, the market price of the common stock would have to close at or

above $4085 per share and $4698 per share, respectively 115% of each of the previous target levels, for 20 consecutive trading days. During 2006, the
Company granted retention awards that cliff vest after three years. The performance and retention restricted stock awards to executives also contain provisions that result in forfeiture by the employee of any unvested share in the event the
Companys common stock does not achieve certain targets $3707 and $4250 per share, respectively. However, to the extent that the requisite service period is rendered, compensation cost for accounting purposes will not be reversed; rather,
it will be recognized regardless of whether or not the market performance target is achieved. The following table summarizes the
assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation to determine the grant-date fair value for the awards granted during the year ended December31, 2007 with market conditions and the derived service period for awards with accelerated vesting
provisions.  Risk-free rate

per share prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R. This table only shows pro forma amounts for the year ended December31, 2005, since in the first quarter of 2006 the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R; and
therefore, compensation expenses are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of December31, 2005.

Employee Benefit Plans The Company and its subsidiaries have various defined contribution savings plans covering substantially all employees. Employees may elect to contribute a portion of their eligible compensation, subject to limits
imposed by the various plans. Certain of the plans provide for partial matching of such contributions. The cost to the Company for these plans amounted to $32 million, $31 million and $43 million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2006
and 2007, respectively. 14. Related Party Transactions On January19, 2007, the Company purchased 177million shares from the Global Signal Significant Stockholders in a private transaction. See note 11.

15. Commitments and Contingencies The Company is involved in various claims, lawsuits and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business along with a derivative lawsuit as
described below. While there are uncertainties inherent in the ultimate outcome of such matters, and it is impossible to presently determine the ultimate costs or losses that may be incurred, if any, management believes the resolution of such
uncertainties and the incurrence of such costs should not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In February 2007, plaintiffs filed a consolidated petition styled In Re Crown Castle
International Corp. Derivative Litigation, Cause No2006-49592; in the 234th Judicial District Court, Harris County, Texas which
consolidated five shareholder derivative lawsuits filed in 2006. The lawsuit names various of the Companys current and former directors and officers. The lawsuit makes allegations relating to the Companys historic stock option practices
and alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar matters. Among the forms of relief, the lawsuit seeks alleged monetary damages sustained by CCIC. Asset Retirement Obligations Pursuant to its ground lease agreements, the Company has the obligation
to perform certain asset retirement activities, including requirements upon lease termination to remove towers or remediate the land upon which its towers reside. Accretion expense related to liabilities for contingent retirement obligations
amounted to $02 million, $16 million and $25 million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. The adoption of FIN 47 resulted in the recognition of liabilities amounting to $139 million for contingent retirement
obligations under certain tower site land leases, asset retirement costs amounting to $49 million, and the recognition of a charge for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle amounting to $90 million. At December31, 2006
and 2007, liabilities for contingent retirement obligations amounted to $185 million and $292 million, respectively inclusive of the $97 million liability recorded in the allocation of the total purchase price for the Global Signal Merger,
representing the net present value of the estimated expected future cash outlay. As of December31, 2007, the estimated undiscounted future cash outlay for asset retirement obligations was approximately $1 billion. See note 1. Property Tax Commitments The Company
is obligated to pay, or reimburse others for, property taxes related to the Companys towers pursuant to operating leases with landlords and other contractual agreements. For the year ended December31, 2007, the Company paid, or
reimbursed others for, property taxes of approximately $442 million, inclusive of the payment to Sprint Nextel discussed below. For the year ended December31, 2008, the Company estimates that it will pay, or reimburse others for, property
taxes of approximately $47 million, inclusive of the payment to Sprint Nextel discussed below. The property taxes for the year ended December31, 2008 and future periods are contingent upon new assessments of the towers and the Companys
appeals of assessments. As a result of a commitment that remained effective at the closing of the Global Signal Merger, the Company has an
obligation to reimburse Sprint Nextel for property taxes Sprint Nextel will pay for the Companys Sprint Towers. The Company paid $137 million for the year ended December31, 2007 $2,095 per tower and expects to pay $142 million for
the year ended December31, 2008. The amount per tower to be paid to Sprint Nextel increases by 3% each successive year through 2037, the expiration of the lease term. See note 2. Letters of Credit The Company has
issued letters of credit to various landlords, insurers and other parties in connection with certain contingent retirement obligations under various tower land leases and certain other contractual obligations. The letters of credit were issued
through the Companys lenders in amounts aggregating $126 million and expire on various dates through February 2009. Operating
Lease Commitments See note 16 for a discussion of the operating lease commitments.

Operating Leases The following table is a summary of rental cash payments owed by the Company, as lessee, to landlords pursuant to lease agreements in effect as of
December31, 2007. The Company is obligated under non-cancelable operating leases for land under 80% of its towers, space on towers owned by third parties that the Company manages, office space and equipment. The majority of these operating
lease agreements have certain termination rights that provide for cancellation after a notice period. The majority of the land and managed tower leases have multiple renewal options at the Companys option and annual escalations. Lease
agreements may also contain provisions for a contingent payment based on revenues or the gross margin derived from the tower located on the leased land. Certain of the land and managed tower leases have purchase options at the end of the original
lease term. Approximately 25% of the land under the Companys towers have lease agreements with remaining terms to expiration including renewals of greater than 20 years. The operating lease payments included in the table below include
payments for certain renewal periods at the Companys option up to the estimated tower useful life of 20 years.  Years Ending December31 2008

Rental expense from operating leases was $1355 million, $1427 million and $3092 million,
respectively, for the years ended December31, 2005, 2006 and 2007. The rental expense was inclusive of contingent payments based on revenues or gross margin derived from the tower located on the leased land of $129 million, $152 million and
$416 million, respectively, for the years ended December31, 2005, 2006 and 2007. 17. Spectrum Lease and Modeo Investment On July23, 2007, the Company entered into a lease of its Spectrum. The Spectrum is leased to a venture formed by Telcom Ventures, LLC and Columbia
Capital LLC CCTV for a $13 million annual lease fee with an initial term from July23, 2007 until October1, 2013. Upon the expiration of the initial term of the lease, CCTV will have the right to acquire the Spectrum for
$130 million, escalated at CPI from July 2007, or to renew the lease for a period of up to ten years on the same terms, subject to the annual lease fee increasing to $143 million. As part of such transaction, the Company also transferred for
nominal consideration the subsidiary holding the assets related to its former trial network in New York City. In addition, the Company is the preferred provider of tower infrastructure for future tower sites during the term of the lease if and as
the Spectrum is deployed by CCTV. See note 19 for a discussion of the asset-write down charges recorded that related to the write-off of substantially all of Modeos assets other than the Spectrum and the restructuring charges related to the
termination of the Modeo employees.

18. Operating Segments and Concentrations of Credit Risk Operating Segments The Companys
reportable operating segments for 2007 are 1CCUSA, primarily consisting of the Companys U.S. including Puerto Rico tower operations, and 2CCAL, the Companys Australian tower operations. Financial results for the Company
are reported to management and the board of directors in this manner. The Company has reclassified the Corporate Office and Other segment into the CCUSA segment reflecting the significance of the CCUSA segment to the consolidated business after the
Global Signal Merger. The Company has reclassified the Emerging Businesses segment, previously consisting of the Modeo business, into the CCUSA segment following both the lease of the Spectrum to CCTV on July23, 2007 and the related write-off
of substantially all of the Modeo assets other than the Spectrum see notes 16 and 19. Segment information for all periods has been reclassified to reflect these changes in reportable segments. The results of operations from Global Signal have been
included in the CCUSA segment from January12, 2007. The measurement of profit or loss currently used by management to evaluate the
results of operations for the Company and its operating segments is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted Adjusted EBITDA. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income loss plus
restructuring charges credits, asset write-down charges, integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, losses on purchases and redemptions of debt, interest and other income expense, interest expense and amortization of deferred
financing costs, impairment of available-for-sale securities, benefit provision for income taxes, minority interests, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income loss from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation
expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and the Companys measure of Adjusted EBITDA
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including as may be used in the historical financial statements of Global Signal. There are no significant revenues resulting from transactions between the Companys
operating segments.

trade receivables. The Company mitigates its risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents by maintaining such deposits at high credit quality financial institutions and monitoring the credit ratings of those institutions. The Companys
restricted cash is held and directed by a trustee see note 1. The Company derives the largest portion of its revenues from customers in
the wireless communications industry. In addition, the Company has concentrations of operations in certain geographic areas including various regions in the U.S. The Company mitigates its concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade
receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of its customers.

in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. b Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f and 15d-15f
under the Exchange Act for the Company. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys CEO and CFO, management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
described in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the Treadway Commission. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007. Based on our assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Management of the Company reviewed the results
of their assessment with the Audit Committee of the board of directors. KPMG LLP, a registered public accounting firm, has issued an

c Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have not been any changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f
of the Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. d Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.
