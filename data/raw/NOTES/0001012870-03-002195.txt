REPORT OF ERNST YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS The Board of Directors and Stockholders
BEA Systems, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BEA Systems, Inc. as of January 31, 2003 and 2002 and the related
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the index at a. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of BEA Systems, Inc. at January 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting
for goodwill and other intangible assets in the year ended January 31, 2003. /s/ERNST YOUNG LLP San Francisco, California February 19, 2003

BEA SYSTEMS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.Organization and Significant Accounting Policies Description of business BEA Systems, Inc. BEA or the
Company is a provider of application infrastructure software and related services that help companies of all sizes build distributed systems that extend investments in existing computer systems and provide the foundation for running an
integrated business. BEAs customers use BEA products as a deployment platform for Internet-based applications, including custom-built and packaged applications, and as a means for robust enterprise application integration among mainframe,
client/server and Internet-based applications. Our revenues are derived from a single group of similar and related products and related services. Principles of consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions
and balances have been eliminated. The operating results of businesses acquired and accounted for as purchases are included from the date of their acquisition. Use of estimates The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Foreign currencies The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated from their respective functional currencies
at the rates in effect at the end of each reporting period while revenue and expense accounts are translated at weighted average rates during the period. Foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected as a separate component of accumulated
other comprehensive income loss. The Company
hedges a portion of its exposure on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily intercompany balances, using forward foreign exchange contracts, which are recorded at fair value based on current exchange rates
each month. Gains and losses resulting from exchange rate fluctuations on forward foreign exchange contracts are recorded in interest income and other, net and are generally offset by the corresponding foreign exchange gains and losses from the
foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Net losses resulting from foreign currency transactions were approximately $351,000, $848,000 and $787,000 in the years ended January 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Cash equivalents and short-term investments
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid
investments, including corporate debt securities and money market funds with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Short-term investments consist principally of corporate debt securities and U.S. Treasuries with remaining time to maturity of two years
or less. The Company considers all investments with remaining time to maturity greater than one year but less than two years to be short-term investments. The investments are classified in the balance sheet as current assets because they can be
readily converted at any time into cash or into securities with a shorter remaining time to maturity and because the Company is not committed to holding the investments until 
54 Table of Contents BEA SYSTEMS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued maturity, but rather the investments are selected for yield management purposes only. The Company determines the appropriate classification
of its investments at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designations as of each balance sheet date. All short-term investments and cash equivalents in the portfolio are classified as available-for-sale and are stated at fair
market value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such
amortization and accretion are included in interest income and other, net. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income and other, net. The cost of securities sold is based
on the average cost method. Accounts
Receivable Accounts receivable are stated
at cost, net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based
upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided based upon a percentage of expected uncollectible accounts. In determining these percentages, the Company analyzes
its historical collection experience and current economic trends including such factors as geography and industry of the customer. Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful
lives of the assets:  Computer hardware and software
2-5years
Furniture and equipment
2-5 years
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the remaining lease term. Acquired intangible assets Acquired intangible assets consist of purchased technology, patents and trademarks, non-compete agreements, distribution rights and customer base related to the Companys acquisitions accounted
for using the purchase method. Amortization of these acquired intangible assets is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives of the assets:  Purchased technology
2-4years
Patents and trademarks
2-5 years
Non-compete agreements
2 years
Distribution rights
25 years
Customer base
3 years
Amortization of purchased technology, patents and trademarks, non-compete agreements, distribution rights and customer base is included as a component of cost of revenues. Acquired in-process research and development without
alternative future use is charged to operations when acquired. 
55 Table of Contents BEA SYSTEMS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
The
Company periodically assesses the impairment of its acquired intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 FAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets. An impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include,
but are not limited to, significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the Companys overall business, and
significant industry or economic trends. When the Company determines that the carrying value of the intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators, the Company measures any impairment based
on a discounted future cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in its current business model. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired in
business combinations accounted for under the purchase accounting method. Prior to January 31, 2002, goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over two to five years. Subsequent to January 31, 2002 goodwill is accounted for under a
non-amortization approach and is evaluated at least annually for impairment on November 1 of each year and whenever events or circumstances may indicate that the carrying amount of the recorded goodwill might not be recoverable. Software development costs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed, requires the capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility. Based on the
Companys product development process, technological feasibility is established upon the completion of a working model. Costs incurred by the Company between the completion of the working model and the point at which the product is ready for
general release have been insignificant. Accordingly, the Company has charged all such costs to research and development expense in the period incurred. Equity investments The Company has made equity investments in privately held companies for business and strategic purposes. These investments are included in
other long-term assets and are accounted for under the cost method because ownership is less than 20 percent and the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating, investing and financing activities of the
investee companies. Under the cost method, the Company does not record its pro-rata share of the investee companys income or loss but rather the investment is recorded at its initial cost and is periodically reviewed for impairment. The
Company regularly reviews the investee companys actual and forecasted operating results, financial position and liquidity, and business and industry factors in assessing whether a decline in value of an equity investment has occurred that is
other than temporary. When such a decline in value is identified, the fair value of the equity investment is estimated based on the preceding factors and an impairment loss is recognized in interest and other, net. Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenues in accordance with the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended. Revenue from software license agreements is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement
exists, delivery of the 
56 Table of Contents BEA SYSTEMS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued product has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. The Company uses the residual method to recognize revenue
when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is
deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue. If evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist, the revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or
when fair value can be established. When
licenses are sold together with services, license fees are recognized upon delivery, provided that 1the above criteria have been met, 2 payment of the license fees is not dependent upon the performance of the services, and 3 the services
do not provide significant customization of the software products and are not essential to the functionality of the software that was delivered. The majority of license fees are recognized in this manner. For arrangements that do not meet the above
criteria, the license and related services revenue is recognized in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts. If the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable,
revenue is recognized as payment is due from the customer, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Generally, the Company considers arrangements with extended payment terms not to be fixed or determinable. In certain regions
or countries where collection risk is generally considered to be high, such as Latin America, China and Korea, revenue is generally recognized when full cash payment is received from the customer. Revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized
on a sell-through basis, that is, when the Company receives persuasive evidence that the reseller has sold the products to an end user customer. Revenue from sales to independent software vendors ISVs who embed BEAs products into their
software products is recognized either upon shipment to the ISV or on a sell-through basis, depending upon the facts and circumstances and BEAs past experience with the particular ISV. The amount of revenue recognized on a sell-through basis
for sales to ISVs has been insignificant to date. Services revenue includes consulting services, customer support and education. Consulting revenue and the related cost of services are recognized on a time and materials basis; however, revenues from certain fixed-price contracts are
recognized on the percentage of completion basis, which involves the use of estimates. The amount of consulting contracts recognized on a percentage of completion basis has not been significant to date. Customer support agreements provide technical
support and the right to unspecified future upgrades on an if-and-when available basis. Customer support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the support period generally one year and education revenues are recognized as the related
training services are provided. The unrecognized portion of amounts billed in advance for licenses and services is recorded as deferred revenues. The Company occasionally purchases software products from vendors who are also customers of BEA. For non-monetary exchanges of software
products, the transaction is generally recorded on a net basis i.e. revenue or expense is recognized equal to the net cash exchanged in the transaction. Stock-based compensation The Company generally grants stock options to its employees for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price equal to the fair market
value of the stock on the date of grant. As permitted under the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation FAS 123, the Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and related interpretations in accounting for stock awards to employees. Accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized in the Companys financial
statements in connection with employee stock awards where the exercise price of the award is equal to the fair market value of the stock at the date of the 
57 Table of Contents BEA SYSTEMS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued award. When stock options are granted with an exercise price that is lower than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant, the
difference is recorded as deferred compensation and amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting term of the stock options. Pro forma information regarding net income loss and net income loss per share is required by FAS 123. This information is required to
be determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options including shares issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, collectively called stock-based awards, under the fair value method of that statement. The
fair value of the Companys stock-based awards granted to employees in fiscal years prior to the Companys initial public offering in fiscal 1998, was estimated using the minimum value method. Stock based awards granted in fiscal years
subsequent to the Companys initial public offering, have been valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Among other things, the Black-Scholes model considers the expected volatility of the Companys stock price, determined in
accordance with FAS 123, in arriving at an option valuation. The minimum value method does not consider stock price volatility. Further, certain other assumptions necessary to apply the Black-Scholes model may differ significantly from assumptions
used in calculating the value of stock based awards granted in fiscal years prior to the Companys initial public offering under the minimum value method. The fair value of the Companys stock based awards to employees was estimated assuming no expected dividends and the following
weighted-average assumptions:   Employee stockpurchase

The
Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including the expected volatility of the stock price. Because the Companys stock based awards have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimates, in the opinion of management, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock based awards.

The pro
forma compensation expense, net of related tax, for fiscal 2003 calculated using the fair value method of $1542 million included in the above table consists of approximately $230 million for amortization of stock awards that were granted in fiscal
2003 and $1312 million for amortization of stock awards that were granted in prior fiscal years. The pro forma compensation expense, net of related tax, for fiscal 2003 consists of approximately $706 million for amortization of stock awards
granted with an exercise price less than $30 per share and $836 million for amortization of stock awards granted in prior fiscal years with an exercise price greater than $30 per share. Net income loss per share Basic net income loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of the
Companys common stock less the weighted average number of shares subject to repurchase and held in escrow. Diluted net income loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of the Companys common stock and
common equivalent shares using the treasury stock method for stock options and using the if-converted method for convertible notes, if dilutive.

Service, as well as revenues and gross margins for license and service revenues and operating expenses by functional area as disclosed in the Companys statement of operations. Advertising costs The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Total advertising expenses were approximately
$54million, $176 million and $182 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Projects funded by third parties The Company occasionally enters into product development agreements with third parties that provide funding to BEA, which is intended by BEA and the third party to offset certain operating costs
incurred by BEA. Such amounts are recorded as a reduction in BEAs operating expenses. During fiscal 2003, approximately $89million of third party funding was recorded as a reduction in operating expenses. The amount of such funding
received by BEA in fiscal 2002 and 2001 was insignificant. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Effect of new accounting pronouncements In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities FAS 146. FAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No94-3, Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring and must be applied for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. FAS
146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value when the liability is incurred rather than when the exit or disposal plan is approved. The adoption of FAS 146
did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF Issue No.
00-21 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF Issue No. 00-21 will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in
fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of EITF Issue No. 00-21 will have on its results of operations and financial condition. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45
FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantors balance sheet upon
issuance of a guarantee. In addition, FIN 45 requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued, including a reconciliation of changes in the entitys product warranty liabilities. The initial recognition and initial
measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after
December 15, 2002. The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements for its financial statements included in this form 
61 Table of Contents BEA SYSTEMS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 10-K. The provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee do not apply to product warranties or to
indemnification provisions in the Companys software license arrangements. However, the accounting profession and regulatory agencies continue to discuss various provisions of this pronouncement with the objective of providing additional
guidance on its application. These discussions and the issuance of any new interpretations, once finalized, could lead to an unanticipated impact on the Companys future financial results. Therefore, although the Company currently does not
believe these provisions will have a material effect on its operating results or financial position, it will continue to evaluate the impact of FIN 45. The only significant guarantees issued to third parties by the Company are the product warranty
and indemnification provisions in our software license agreements and the residual value guarantee of approximately $330 million, which is pursuant to our synthetic land lease transaction. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 FAS 148,
Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. FAS No. 148 amends FASB Statement No. 123 FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide
alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair-value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. It also amends the disclosure provisions of that statement to require prominent disclosure
about the effects on reported net income and earnings per share and the entitys accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee compensation. Certain of the disclosure requirements are required for all companies, regardless of
whether the fair value method or intrinsic value method is used to account for stock-based employee compensation arrangements. The Company continues to account for its employee incentive stock option plans using the intrinsic value method in
accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The amendments to FAS 123 will be effective for financial statements for fiscal years ended
after December 15, 2002 and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Accordingly, the Company adopted the disclosure provisions of this statement in its fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46. This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest
entities. Under current practice, two enterprises generally have been included in consolidated financial statements because one enterprise controls the other through voting interests. FIN 46 defines the concept of variable interests and
requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved. This interpretation applies immediately to variable interest
entities created after January 31, 2003. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003.
For these variable interest entities, the assets, liabilities and non-controlling interest of the variable interest entity would be initially measured at their carrying amounts, with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet
and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. If determining the carrying amounts is not practicable, fair value at the date FIN 46 first applies may be used to measure the assets,
liabilities and non-controlling interest of the variable interest entity. If it is reasonably possible that an enterprise will consolidate or disclose information about a variable interest entity when FIN 46 becomes effective, the enterprise shall
disclose information about those entities in all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003. The interpretation may be applied prospectively with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating
previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated. The Company is evaluating the impact of applying FIN 46 and has not yet completed this analysis. The
Company has not yet concluded whether the current land lease structure would be consolidated upon its adoption of FIN 46 because the rules are recent and contain numerous complicated provisions that the accounting profession continues to analyze.
The impact of 
62 Table of Contents BEA SYSTEMS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued consolidating the land held under lease at carrying value would be an increase to assets and liabilities of approximately $330 million. It is
possible that the final determination under FIN 46 will be that the land must be capitalized on the Companys balance sheet at current fair market value, which could be less than the outstanding lease balance in the near term. This could result
in a material charge to earnings, equal to the difference between the current fair market value of the property and the outstanding lease balance at the time such determination is made. Alternatively, the Company could elect to restructure the
financing arrangement or exercise the purchase option, which could also result in it recording the land on its balance sheet at current fair market value, resulting in a material charge to earnings as described above. 2.Financial Instruments Concentration of credit risk and bad debt expense
Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt securities and trade receivables. The Company invests its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in commercial paper rated
A-1/P-1, corporate bonds rated A2/A or higher, money market instruments and U.S. Treasuries and limits the amounts invested with any one institution, type of security and issuer. The Company sells its products to customers, typically large corporations, in a variety of industries in the
Americas, Europe and the Asia/Pacific region. The Company performs credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and limits the amount of credit extended as deemed appropriate, but generally requires no collateral. The Company
maintains allowances for estimated credit losses and, to date, such losses have been within managements expectations. Future credit losses may differ from the Companys estimates, particularly if the financial conditions of its customers
were to deteriorate, and could have a material impact on the Companys future results of operations. Bad debt expense was $35 million, $87 million and $50 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. No customer accounted for more than 10 percent of total
revenues in fiscal 2003, 2002 or 2001. There were no customers that accounted for more than 10 percent of accounts receivable as of January 31, 2003, 2002 or 2001. The only individual country outside of the United States with revenues greater than
10 percent of total revenues in fiscal 2001 was the United Kingdom with 103 percent or $847 million. No one individual country outside of the United States accounted for more than 10 percent of total revenues in either fiscal 2003 or 2002.

contracts The Company enters into forward
foreign currency contracts to reduce its exposure to the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The contracts are marked-to-market on a monthly basis and are not used for
trading or speculative purposes. At January 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had outstanding forward foreign currency contracts with notional amounts of approximately $2208 million and $1754 million, respectively. All of the Companys forward
foreign currency contracts have original maturities of 115 days or less.

Accordingly, the estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange. For certain of the Companys financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, and
notes payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts was based on the estimated amount at which they could be settled based on quoted exchange rates. The fair
values of the convertible subordinated notes are determined using quoted market prices. 3.Property and Equipment Property and equipment consist of the following in thousands:  January 31 2003 2002 Computer hardware and software

small companies, for which the total consideration was approximately $135 million and $226 million, respectively, in aggregate. The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method, with a substantial majority of the purchase price
allocated to deferred compensation, intangible assets and goodwill. 5.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets On February 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and as a result will no longer amortize goodwill, but will test
for impairment at least annually on November 1 of each year or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

018 6.Impairment of Certain Acquired Intangible Assets and Goodwill In the third quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company recorded asset impairment charges totaling $801 million against certain acquired
intangible assets and goodwill, $71 million of which was a write-down of certain acquired intangible assets that is included in cost of revenues and $730 million of which was a write-down of goodwill that is included in operating expenses. The
acquired intangible assets and goodwill that were impaired primarily originated from the acquisitions of The Theory Center, Inc. the Theory Center in November 1999 and Bauhaus in October 2000. During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company observed
indicators that the acquired intangible assets and goodwill from the Theory Center and Bauhaus were possibly impaired and, accordingly, performed an assessment for impairment. With respect to the Theory Center, the Company made product and strategic
changes during the third quarter that significantly decreased the importance and value of the technology acquired from the Theory Center, including the decision to discontinue the use of certain technology acquired from the Theory 
69 Table of Contents BEA SYSTEMS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Center. With respect to Bauhaus, the Company observed a significant downturn in its consulting business during the third quarter of fiscal
2002, and in particular the consulting business of Bauhaus, which indicated possible impairment. The Company performed asset impairment tests at the lowest operational level that had separately identifiable cash flows related to the Theory Center and Bauhaus intangible assets and goodwill. The
tests were performed by comparing the expected undiscounted cash flows over a 39 month period for the Theory Center and a 51 month period for Bauhaus to the carrying amount of the long-lived assets resulting from the acquisitions. The conclusion of
these tests was that the decline in value of the Theory Center and Bauhaus intangible assets and goodwill was significant and other than temporary. The impairment loss was measured as the amount by which the carrying values of such assets exceeded
their fair value. Measurement of fair value was based on analyses of the discounted future cash flows at the Theory Center and Bauhaus level. In performing these analyses, the Company used the best information available under the circumstances,
including reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections of future operating results. The discount rates used in the analyses were 30 percent for the Theory Center and 20 percent for Bauhaus, which were based on historical risk premiums
required by investors for companies of BEAs size, industry and capital structure and included risk factors specific to the sectors in which the Theory Center and Bauhaus operated. The analyses indicated that the intangible assets and goodwill
for the Theory Center were impaired by an amount totaling $645 million and for Bauhaus by an amount totaling $100 million. In addition, an impairment charge of $56 million was recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2002, which related to the
write-off of goodwill associated with a small foreign sales operation that was disposed. The total impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2002 is summarized as follows in millions:  The Theory Center

8.Facilities Consolidation and Severance Charges During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company approved a plan to consolidate certain facilities in regions including the United
States, Canada, and Germany. A facilities consolidation charge of $200 million was calculated using managements best estimates and was based upon the remaining future lease commitments and brokerage fees for vacant facilities from the date of
facility consolidation, net of estimated future sublease income. The facilities consolidation charge also included the write-off of $22 million of leasehold improvements. The estimated costs of abandoning these leased facilities, including
estimated costs to sublease, were based on market information and trend analyses, including information obtained from third party real estate industry sources. As of January 31, 2003, $126 million of lease termination costs, net of anticipated
sublease income, remains accrued and is expected to be fully utilized by fiscal 2012. In calculating this charge, certain assumptions were made relating to such factors as the estimated time periods of vacancy and sublease rates and opportunities.
If actual circumstances prove to be materially worse than management has estimated, the Companys total charges for these vacant facilities could be significantly higher. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company
reduced the scope and re-evaluated the timing of the planned construction of facilities at its San Jose, California headquarters, resulting in an additional facilities related charge of $50million. Adjustments to the facilities consolidation
charge will be made in future periods, if necessary, based upon then current actual events and circumstances. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2002, the Company reduced its workforce by approximately 10percent and, accordingly,
it recorded total severance charges of $155 million, of which $103 million was paid in fiscal 2002 and $52 million was paid in fiscal 2003. The employee reductions were across all business functions, operating units and major geographic regions.
Severance charges included severance benefits, notice pay and out-placement counseling services.

Realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income, if any, the timing and amount of which is uncertain in part due to the potential impact of future stock option deductions. Accordingly, a valuation
allowance, in an amount equal to the net deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income at January 31, 2003 and 2002, has been established to reflect these uncertainties. The valuation allowance decreased by approximately $122 million in
fiscal year 2003 and increased by approximately $430 million in fiscal year 2002. Approximately $1895 million and $2016 million of the valuation allowance at January 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, relates to tax benefits associated with
exercises of stock options, which will reduce income taxes payable and be credited to additional paid-in capital when realized.

On
February 1, 2003, 20 million additional shares became available for issuance under the Incentive Stock Option Plans and 4 million additional shares became available for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Class B common stock In March 1997, BEAs Board of Directors authorized 35
million shares of an additional class of common stock Class B common stock, convertible into 140 million shares of ordinary common stock. The Class B common stock had the same rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions as the common stock,
except that each share of Class B common stock was convertible into one share of common stock, had no voting rights except as required by Delaware law and had no right to vote for the election of directors. The shares of Class B common stock were
convertible at the option of the holder into common stock, provided that such conversion did not result in the converting stockholder holding more than 49 percent of the Companys outstanding voting securities. The shares of Class B common
stock could be automatically converted into common stock upon the occurrence of certain events. During fiscal 2001, all remaining outstanding shares of Class B common stock were converted into common stock. Share Repurchase Program In September 2001, the Board of Directors approved a share
repurchase program for the Company to repurchase up to $1000 million of its common stock the September 2001 Share Repurchase Program. An insignificant number of shares were repurchased in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003, approximately 69
million shares of the Companys common stock were repurchased at a total cost of approximately $421 million. Preferred Stock Rights Plan In September 2001, the Board of Directors approved a Preferred Stock Rights Plan, which has the antitakeover effect of causing substantial
dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the Company on terms not approved by the Board of Directors. Under the Plan, the Company issued a dividend of one right for each share of the Companys common stock, par value of $0001 per
share, held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 12, 2001. Each right will initially entitle stockholders to purchase a fractional share of the Companys preferred stock for $15000. The rights are not immediately
exercisable and will become exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events. If a person or group acquires, or announces a tender or exchange offer that would result in the acquisition of, 15 percent or more of the Companys common stock
except pursuant to an amendment dated January 15, 2003 in the case of FMR Corp., for whom the threshold is an amount greater than 16 percent while the stockholder rights plan remains in place, the rights will become exercisable, unless redeemed
for $0001 per right, by all rights holders except the acquiring person or group, for shares of the Company or of the third party acquirer having a value of twice the rights then-current exercise price. Deferred compensation During fiscal 2003, the Company granted approximately 59
million discounted stock options to certain employees and executive officers with an exercise price that was lower than the fair market value of the Companys stock on the date of grant grant date fair value. The discounts on
these stock options ranged from 25 percent to 50 percent of the grant date fair value. The exercise prices of these stock options range from $278 to $646, and the weighted average exercise price of these stock options was $361. The aggregate
amount by which the price of the Companys stock on the date of grant exceeded the exercise price of the stock options was approximately $117 million, which was recorded as deferred compensation. This balance is amortized on a 
76 Table of Contents BEA SYSTEMS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued straight-line basis over the three and four year vesting terms of the stock options. The amortization expense related to these stock options
was approximately $19 million in fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2003, the Company also granted 100,000 shares of restricted stock with a purchase price of $001 per share and a vesting term of one year. The aggregate amount by which the price of the
Companys stock on the date of grant exceeded the purchase price of the restricted stock was approximately $12 million, which was recorded as deferred compensation and is amortized over the one year vesting term. During fiscal 2002, BEA recorded total deferred compensation
of approximately $129 million, which represented the portion of the consideration for the acquisitions of CrossGain and other small companies that is dependent upon the continued employment of certain employees. This balance of deferred
compensation is being amortized to operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the vesting term, which ranges from two to four years. An insignificant amount of deferred compensation was recorded in fiscal 2001. 12.Employee Benefit Plans Stock option plans Under the Companys stock option plans, incentive and nonqualified stock options may be granted to
eligible participants to purchase shares of the Companys common stock. Options generally vest over a four-year period and have a term of ten years. Annually, the number of shares available in the stock option plan is automatically increased by
an amount of up to 6 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, less the number of shares of common stock added to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, based on a formula, but not to
exceed 24 million shares per fiscal year. The exercise price of the stock options is determined by the Companys Board of Directors on the date of grant and is generally equal to the fair market value of the stock on the grant date.

1702 Employee stock purchase plan In March 1997, the Companys stockholders approved an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP Plan for all employees meeting certain eligibility criteria. Under the ESPP Plan, employees may purchase shares of the
Companys common stock, subject to certain limitations, at 85 percent of the lower of the closing sale price of BEAs Common Stock reported on the Nasdaq National Market Nasdaq at the beginning or the end of each six-month
offering period. Additionally, the price paid by the employee will not exceed 85 percent of the closing sale price as reported on Nasdaq at the beginning of a 24 month period that restarts in January or July of every second year, determined by the
employees enrollment date in the plan. Eligible employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions by electing to have between 1 percent and 15 percent of their compensation withheld, subject to certain limitations. Annually, the
number of shares available in the ESPP Plan automatically increases by an amount equal to the lesser of 24 million shares or 6 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year less the number
of shares of common stock added to the stock option plan. Approximately 24 million, 18 million, and 43 million shares for total proceeds of approximately $195 million, $247 million and $228 million were sold through the ESPP Plan in fiscal
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. At January 31, 2003, 203 million shares had been issued under the 
78 Table of Contents BEA SYSTEMS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued ESPP Plan and 59 million shares were reserved for future issuance. On February 1, 2003, 4 million additional shares became available for
issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The weighted average grant date fair value of the ESPP shares was $499, $1882 and $1501 in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 401k plan The Company has a 401k Profit Sharing Plan the 401K
Plan that allows eligible employees to contribute up to 15 percent of their annual compensation to the 401K Plan, subject to certain limitations. The employees funds are not held in BEA stock directly, but rather the employee directs
how the funds are distributed across a series of mutual funds. The Company matches 50 percent of the employee contributions subject to a maximum rate of 6 percent of salary, not to exceed $3,000 per year. Employee contributions vest immediately,
whereas the Companys matching contributions vest at a rate of 25 percent per year of employment. The 401K Plan also allows the Company to make discretionary contributions; however, none have been made to date. The Company recognized matching
contribution expense of $38 million, $46 million and $14 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 13.Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Loss The components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss are as follows in thousands:  January 31 2003 2002 2001 Foreign currency translation adjustment

stock and for stock options granted with an exercise price lower than the fair market value of the Companys stock on the date of grant. During fiscal 2001, the Company sold investments in WebGain with a cost of $283 million to WP Equity
Partners in exchange for a note receivable due from WP Equity Partners in the amount of approximately $500 million. In connection with this transaction, additional notes receivable of $180 million were issued to BEA during fiscal 2002. During

lease payments included in the above table of approximately $99 million per year commencing in fiscal 2004 through 2006 are calculated based on a variable London Interbank Offering Rate LIBOR see Land Lease below. The Company
has estimated future lease obligations based on current LIBOR. Actual future lease payments will differ based on changes in LIBOR. The land lease payments included in the above table exclude any amounts that could be payable under the residual value
guarantee see Land Lease below. Total
rent expense charged to operations for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 was approximately $555 million, $377 million and $242 million, respectively. Litigation and Other Claims The Company is subject to legal proceedings and other claims that arise, such as those arising from domestic and foreign tax authorities
and employee-related matters, in the ordinary course of its business. While management currently believes the amount of ultimate liability, if any, with respect to these actions will not materially affect the Companys financial position,
results of operations, or liquidity, the ultimate outcome of any litigation or claim is uncertain, and the impact of an unfavorable outcome could be material to the Company. Land Lease During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company entered into a lease agreement for the lease of approximately 40 acres of land
adjacent to the Companys San Jose, California headquarters the land lease. The Company intends to construct additional corporate offices and research and development facilities on the leased land. Under the land lease agreement,
the lessor will finance up to $331 million of land and associated costs. The land lease has an initial term of five years with renewal options. Rent payments commence at the beginning of the third year. Although no rental payments are currently
being made under the land lease, the Company began expensing rent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 of approximately $3 million per quarter, as it re-evaluated the scope and timing of the construction for additional corporate offices. The
agreement qualifies for operating lease accounting treatment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases, and, as such, the land and the related obligation discussed below are not included on the
Companys balance sheet. Total minimum
lease payments are estimated to be approximately $99 million per year commencing in fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2006, and are calculated based on LIBOR. The minimum lease payments will fluctuate 
81 Table of Contents BEA SYSTEMS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued from time to time depending on changes in LIBOR. As of January 31, 2003, the outstanding lease balance was approximately $3274 million. The
Company has an option to renew the land lease agreement, purchase the land at the end of the lease term or earlier for the outstanding lease balance, or, to arrange for the sale of the land to a third party. If the Company elects to renew the lease
or arrange for the sale of the land, it is obligated to pay any shortfall between the fair value or sales price and the outstanding land lease balance under a residual value guarantee of approximately $330 million. If it became probable that the
value of the leased property would be less than the outstanding lease balance at lease termination, the estimated deficiency would be expensed ratably over the remaining lease term. If the Company elects to purchase the land, the Company could be
required to capitalize the land on the Companys balance sheet at then current fair market value, which could be less than the outstanding lease balance in the near term. This could result in a material charge to earnings at the time of
purchase, equal to the difference between the current fair market value of the property and the outstanding lease balance. As part of the land lease agreement, the Company must maintain a minimum restricted cash balance consisting of United States government
securities as defined in the lease, which was $1265 million as of January 31, 2003. This amount represents collateral for specified obligations to the lessor under the lease. The restricted cash cannot be withdrawn and is managed by a third party
subject to certain limitations. The Company has classified this amount as a long-term restricted asset on the consolidated balance sheet at January 31, 2003. The Company must maintain certain covenants, including liquidity, leverage and
profitability ratios. As of January31, 2003, the Company is in compliance with all financial covenants. In the event of a default, the lessor may demand payment equal to the lessors investment, require BEA to purchase, facilitate the
sale of, or surrender the property. Employer
Payroll Taxes The Company is subject to
employer payroll taxes when employees exercise stock options. The payroll taxes are assessed on the stock option gain, which is the difference between the common stock price on the date of exercise and the exercise price. The tax rate varies
depending upon the employees taxing jurisdiction. The timing and amount of employer payroll taxes is directly related to the timing and number of options exercised by employees, the gain thereon and the tax rate in the applicable jurisdiction.
During fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded employer payroll taxes related to stock option exercises of approximately $736,000, $26million and $133 million, respectively. Because the Company is unable to predict these employer
payroll taxes the Company is unable to predict what, if any, expense will be recorded in a future period. Warranties and Indemnification The Company generally provides a warranty for its software products and services to its customers and accounts for its warranties under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies FAS 5. The Companys products are generally warranted to perform substantially as described in the associated product documentation for a
period of 90 days. The Companys services are generally warranted to be performed consistent with industry standards for a period of 90 days from delivery. In the event there is a failure of such warranties, the Company generally is obligated
to correct the product or service to conform to the warranty provision or, if the Company is unable to do so, the customer is entitled to seek a refund of the purchase price of the product or service. The Company has not provided for a warranty
accrual as of January 31, 2003 or January 31, 2002. To date, the Companys product warranty expense has not been significant. The Company generally agrees to indemnify its customers against legal claims that the Companys software products infringe certain
third-party intellectual property rights and accounts for its indemnification obligations 
82 Table of Contents BEA SYSTEMS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued under FAS 5. In the event of such a claim, the Company is generally obligated to defend its customer against the claim and to either settle
the claim at the Companys expense or pay damages that the customer is legally required to pay to the third-party claimant. In addition, in the event of an infringement, the Company agrees to modify or replace the infringing product, or, if
those options are not reasonably possible, to refund the cost of the software, as pro-rated over a three-year period. To date, the Company has not been required to make any payment resulting from infringement claims asserted against our customers.
As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for infringement costs as of January 31, 2003. 17.Events Subsequent to Date of Auditors Report In February and March 2003, under the September 2001 Share Repurchase Program, the Company repurchased approximately 53 million shares of
its common stock at a total cost of approximately $520 million. In March 2003, the Board of Directors approved an additional repurchase of up to $1000 million of the Companys common stock.
