INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Stockholders and Board of Directors
JLM Industries, Inc.
Tampa, Florida
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of JLM Industries,
Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 1997 and 1998, and the
related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, of changes
in stockholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1998. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of JLM Industries, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1998 and the consolidated results
of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1998 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP

JLM INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1997 AND 1998
1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
JLM Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries JLM or the Company is a
leading marketer and distributor of certain commodity chemicals, principally
acetone and phenol. JLM is headquartered in Tampa, Florida.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of JLM and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. JLM
principal operating subsidiaries are JLM Marketing, Inc., JLM Chemicals,
Inc., JLM Terminals, Inc., JLM International, Inc., Olefins Marketing, Inc.,
JLM Industries Europe B.V., JLM Chemicals Canada, Inc., JLM Industries de
Venezuela, C.A., Tolson Holland B.V., Tolson Transport B.V., Tolson Asia,
Ltd. the Tolson Group, Browning Chemical Corporation Browning,
Inquinosa International S.A. Inquinosa Aurora Chemicals, Inc. Aurora
and Phoenix Tank Car Corporation Phoenix. All material intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Included in
the 1998 consolidated financial statements is the 501% owned subsidiary.
Inquinosa, that the Company acquired in July 1998 see Note16. Included in
the 1996 and 1997 consolidated financial statements is the 55% owned
subsidiary, JLM Industries Europe B.V. In July 1997, the Company purchased
the 45% minority interest in JLM Industries Europe B.V. for approximately
$111,000 cash. Effective January 1, 1997, both Aurora and Phoenix were
dissolved and all business conducted under these companies were transferred
to the Company remaining subsidiaries.
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS - Cash equivalents consist of highly
liquid investments with original maturities from purchase date of three
months or less.
INVENTORIES - Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The
costs of JLM Marketing, Inc. inventories are determined on the last-in,
first-out LIFO method. As of December 31, 1997 and 1998, JLM Marketing,
Inc. inventory was approximately 30% and 40%, respectively, of total
inventory. The costs of the Company remaining inventories are determined
on the first-in, first-out FIFO method. In the year ended December 31,
1998, there was a decrease of LIFO inventory prices partially offset by an
increase in LIFO inventory quantities resulting in the elimination of the
LIFO reserve and the creation of a LIFO inventory supplement. If LIFO
inventories were valued at current costs, operating income would have been
approximately $13,000, $570,000 and $1,585,000 lower than those
reported for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively.
The excess supplement of the replacement cost over the value of
inventories based upon the LIFO method was approximately $1,046,000 and
$539,000 as of December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively.
JLM enters into contracts whereby parties to the contracts agree to
exchange various quantities of inventory over a specified period of time.
JLM records these exchanges of inventory at the lower of cost or market. As
of December 31, 1997 and 1998, JLM owed approximately $80,000 and $1,439,000
respectively, under these contracts which are included in inventory.
31
In 1996, JLM entered into a fixed price financial hedging contract in
order to minimize its exposure in the three months ended March 31, 1997 to
the fluctuations in the price of propylene, one of the two key raw materials
used by JLM Chemicals, Inc. The purpose of the financial hedging contract
was to secure an acceptable purchase price for JLM propylene requirements
in the three months ended March 31, 1997. The contract was for 13 million
pounds of propylene at $1225 per pound. In accordance with the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 80, ACCOUNTING FOR FUTURES CONTRACTS, gains and
losses for such contracts are recognized as an adjustment to cost of sales
at the time the finished goods are sold by JLM. During the three months
ended March 31, 1997, JLM purchased and sold substantially all of the 13
million pounds of propylene covered under the hedging contract. As a result,
JLM recognized a gain of approximately $493,000, which reduced cost of sales
for the period. JLM can be exposed to losses in connection with such
contracts, generally the amount by which the fixed hedged price on the
contract is above the market price for such chemicals at the time of
purchase. The Company did not enter into any material financial hedging
contracts in 1997 or 1998.
OTHER INVESTMENTS - Other investments include investments in partnerships
and the investment in Olefins Terminal Corporation OTC. JLM accounts for
certain of its investments in partnerships on an equity basis and,
accordingly, records its respective share of profits and losses that are
allocated in accordance with the partnership agreements. Except for OTC, JLM
has no obligation to make any contributions beyond its initial investment.
See further discussion of OTC in Note 5.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT - Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method
over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives.
A summary of the lives used for computing depreciation is as follows    Buildings                 15 and 315 years
Vehicles and airplane           2 to 10 years
Equipment                 5 to 10 years
Furniture and fixtures          3 to 5 years
Leasehold improvements          Life of lease
OTHER ASSETS - As of December 31, 1997 and 1998, other assets consist
primarily of the cash surrender values of life insurance policies held on
key employees, license fees, certain development costs and advances on
consulting and non-competition agreements see Note 12. These costs are
amortized on a straight-line basis from 2 to 10 years. Accumulated
amortization on other assets as of December 31, 1997 and 1998 was
approximately $927,000 and $1,355,000, respectively.
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES - Goodwill and other intangibles resulting
from business acquisitions see Note 16, comprising cost in excess of net
assets of businesses acquired, customer lists, tax credit carry forwards,
employee contracts and distribution rights are being amortized over their
respective useful lives ranging from 3 to 40 years.
INCOME TAXES - JLM accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability
method as required by SFAS No. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME Taxes. Under this
method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of
temporary differences by applying 
32
enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of
existing assets and liabilities. The effect of a tax rate change on deferred
taxes is recognized in income in the period that the change in the rate is
enacted.
Prior to the acquisition of Aurora on January 1, 1997 and Phoenix on June
1, 1997 by the Company, Aurora and Phoenix elected to be treated as S
corporations for federal income tax purposes, with profits and losses
generally reportable by the stockholder in their individual income tax
returns. Any tax liability related to either Aurora or Phoenix prior to
their acquisition by JLM will be the responsibility of their shareholders.
Accordingly, JLM has recorded no tax liability for such periods. On a pro
forma basis, the tax liability for Aurora and Phoenix is immaterial.
TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Assets and
liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange
rates. Results of operations are translated at weighted average rates for
the year. The effects of exchange rate changes in translating foreign
financial statements are presented as a separate component of stockholders'
equity, except for the Company Venezuelan subsidiary which operates in a
hyperinflationary economy for which the translation gains and losses are
included in net income currently.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS - From time to time, JLM enters into foreign
exchange contracts as a hedge against foreign accounts payable and
receivables. Market value gains and losses are recognized and the resulting
credit or debit offsets foreign exchange gains and losses on these payables
and receivables. At December 31, 1997 and 1998, JLM had no open foreign
exchange contracts.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION - In accordance with SFAS No. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, JLM has elected to recognize stock-based
compensation under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, ACCOUNTING
FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES, and to disclose in the consolidated financial
statements the effects of SFAS No. 123 as if its fair value recognition
provisions were adopted. See Note 19 for additional information on the
Company stock-based compensation.
STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY - Effective May 22, 1997, the Company amended its
Certificate of Incorporation and increased the number of shares of common
stock authorized to 30,000,000 and changed the par value from no par to $01
per share. Additionally, this amendment provided for 5,000,000 authorized
shares of a new class of preferred stock. All shares and per share amounts
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
retroactively adjusted for the amendment.
INCOME PER SHARE - The FASB has issued SFAS No. 128, EARNINGS PER Share,
which was required to be adopted for financial statement periods ending
after December 15, 1997. SFAS No. 128 requires that basic and diluted
earnings per share replace the primary and fully diluted earnings per share,
respectively. The basic calculation computes earnings per share based only
on the weighted average number of shares outstanding as compared to
primary earnings per share reported in prior years which included common
stock equivalents. The diluted earnings per share calculation is computed
similarly to fully diluted earnings per share reported in prior years. All
earnings per share amounts for all periods presented conform to SFAS No.
128. See Note 13.
33
REVENUE RECOGNITION - The Company recognizes revenue from product sales
upon shipment and passage of title. The Company estimates and records
provisions for quantity rebates and sales allowances, if necessary, in the
period the sale is reported.
USES OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles,
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimated.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - The estimated fair value of amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements have been determined by
using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
The carrying value of all current assets and current liabilities
approximates the fair value because of their short-term nature. The fair
value of long-term debt approximates its carrying value.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-TERM ASSETS - The Company evaluates the recoverability
of the net carrying value of its property and equipment, goodwill and other
intangibles, and other long-lived assets by comparing the carrying values to
the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. A deficiency in these cash
flows relative to the carrying amounts is an indication of the need for a
write-down due to impairment. The impairment write-down would be the
difference between the carrying amounts and the fair value of these assets.
A loss on impairment would be recognized by a charge to operations.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK - Financial instruments which potentially
subjects the Company to a concentration of credit risk principally consist
of trade accounts receivable. Credit risk with respect to trade accounts
receivable is generally diversified due to the large number of entities
comprising the Company customer base and their dispersion across many
different geographic regions. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers' financial condition and requires collateral,
such as letters of credit, or business insurance in certain circumstances.
IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS - In June 1997, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 130, REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, that establishes
standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its
components in a full set of general-purpose financial statements and is
effective for all companies with fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1997. SFAS No. 130 requires that all items that are required to be
recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income
be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same
prominence as other financial statements. SFAS No. 130 does not require a
specific format for that financial statement but requires that an enterprise
display an amount representing total comprehensive income for the period in
that financial statement. SFAS No. 130 requires that an enterprise i
classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature and ii
display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately
from retained earnings and additional paid-in capital in the equity section
of a statement of financial position. The Company has adopted SFAS No. 130
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of income and
comprehensive income.
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, SEGMENT DATA, that requires
companies to report selected segment information in their quarterly reports
issued to shareholders for fiscal 
34
years beginning after December 31, 1997. It also requires, among other
items, entity-wide disclosure about the products and services an entity
provides, the material countries in which it holds assets and reports
revenues and its major customers. The Company will begin implementing the
requirements under SFAS No. 131 for quarterly purposes beginning in fiscal
year 1999. The Company has adopted SFAS No. 131 in 1998 see Note 21.
However, there were no changes required to prior year amounts.
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE
INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, that requires that gains or losses be
recognized in earnings for a fair value hedge in the period of change
together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to
the risk being hedged. Management does not believe that the adoption of SFAS
No. 133 will have a significant impact on the Company consolidated
financial statements. SFAS No. 133 is effective for all fiscal quarters of
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999.
RECLASSIFICATIONS - Certain amounts in the 1996 and 1997 consolidated
financial statements are reclassified to conform to the 1998 presentation.
3. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment consist of the following at December 31                             1997      1998
Land and building                $ 7,123,124  $ 7,438,563
Vehicles                       319,708    216,652
Airplane                      2,411,681   2,475,939
Equipment                     23,647,967   24,977,860
Leased equipment - capital leases          1,188,122   1,188,122
Furniture and fixtures                878,288    882,804
Leasehold improvements                388,250    442,699
35,957,140   37,622,639
Less accumulated depreciation and amortization   6,452,129  9,237,650
$ 29,505,011  $ 28,384,989
Depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment was
approximately $2,242,000, $2,598,000 and $2,834,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively. The leased equipment
consists of several capital leases, which expire through June 1999, with a
$189,000 option to purchase at the end of the lease period. Future minimum
capital lease payments for each of the years 1999 through 2003 are
approximately $420,000, $74,000, $54,000, $14,000 and $11,000, respectively.
4. INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPS
Investments in partnerships at December 31, 1997 and 1998, consist
principally of the following    PHENOL PLANT PARTNERSHIP - The Company holds a 2% interest in the Mt.
Vernon Phenol Plant Partnership via its wholly owned subsidiary JLM Ind,
Inc., an Indiana corporation. The plant converts cumene into phenol that is
marketed under contractual agreements to GE Plastics. JLM has a long-term
exclusive agreement through 2002, and thereafter, unless the 
35
agreement is terminated upon prior notice, to purchase all acetone not used
internally by GE Plastics produced at the Mt. Vernon Phenol Plant. Based on
its percentage ownership, JLM accounts for this investment using the cost
method. As of December 31, 1997 and 1998, the amount of this investment was
approximately $496,000. During 1997 and 1998, JLM contributed approximately
$4,000 and $0, respectively, to the partnership and received no
distributions in either year.
ASIAN PARTNERSHIP - In April 1997, JLM entered into an agreement to
purchase 25% of the common stock of S.K. Chemicals Asia Pte. Ltd. SK
Chemicals, an international petrochemical distributor, for $500,000 cash.
In addition, in April 1997, JLM entered into an agreement to purchase for
$500,000 cash a 127% interest in S.K. Chemical Trading Pte. SK Trading.
As of December 31, 1997 and 1998, these investments of approximately
$1,069,000 were included in other investments in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet and are carried on the cost method.
REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS - The Company holds a 99% interest in Len-Kel
Realty Limited Partnership Len-Kel. During 1987 and 1988, Len-Kel
acquired 28 units in a development project converting historical buildings
into residential use. The units are currently operated as rental property.
JLM is a limited partner in Len-Kel and cannot exert control over the
partnership. Accordingly, the investment is carried on the equity method. As
of December 31, 1997 and 1998, the amount of this investment was
approximately $996,000 and $948,000, respectively.
JLM holds other investments through limited partnerships. The amount of
these partnerships totaled approximately $821,000 and $744,000 at December
31, 1997 and 1998, respectively, and are carried on the cost method in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
During each of the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, JLM
recorded losses from partnership investments of approximately $48,000. As a
limited partner, the Company has no obligation to make any contributions
beyond its initial investment.
5. OLEFINS TERMINAL CORPORATION
During 1991, JLM formed a 100% owned subsidiary, OTC, to design and
construct a polymer grade propylene export facility in Bayport, Texas. On
August 15, 1991, OTC issued stock and stock warrants to other investors
reducing the Company ownership to 49% 32% on a fully diluted basis.
Construction was completed in July 1992. The Company accounts for its
investment in OTC on the equity basis. During the years ended December 31,
1996, 1997 and 1998, losses from the investment in OTC of approximately
$55,000 and $830,000, and $0, respectively, were recorded. As of
December 31, 1997 and 1998, the Company investment in OTC was $0 due to
the cumulative losses incurred by OTC.
During 1996, JLM provided OTC with financial and management services for a
fee of 25% on certain sales, as defined. As part of the refinancing of
OTC long-term debt discussed below, JLM switched its management fee to a
fixed rate of approximately $16,000 per month. JLM recorded management fees
of approximately $139,000, $134,000 and $192,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively, under this agreement.
On May 7, 1997, OTC refinanced its existing long-term debt and replaced it
with an unsecured term loan the Term Loan. The proceeds from the Term
Loan was, among other 
36
items, used to repay all of OTC existing long-term debt, purchase all
outstanding stock warrants and repay all outstanding management fees to JLM.
After the purchase of the stock warrants, OTC is owned 50% by JLM. In
conjunction with the refinancing, JLM terminaling contract was canceled
and a new, one-year terminaling arrangement, which became effective January
1, 1997, was entered into by all parties. The new terminaling contract,
which has no minimum throughput requirements, requires JLM to pay for
throughput at $16 per metric ton during the one-year term and it cancels the
carryover rights from the old terminaling contract. Also in conjunction with
the refinancing, JLM non-current note receivable, including accrued
interest, was converted to an investment in OTC and JLM account payable to
OTC was forgiven and accounted for as a reduction in JLM investment in
OTC. The amount of the accounts payable to OTC which was forgiven was
approximately $2 million. In addition, JLM has pledged its ownership
interest in OTC to the other 50% owner as security for certain contingent
payment obligations required to be made equally by JLM and the other 50%
owner of OTC, if OTC has inadequate operating funds.
The following summarizes the assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity
of OTC as of December 31:
1997     1998 
ASSETS:
Current                   $ 1,233,608  $  874,033
Noncurrent                  9,502,090   7,590,993
$10,735,698  $ 8,465,026
LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT:
Current liabilities             $  534,383  $  524,814
Noncurrent liabilities            7,300,000   7,300,000
Stockholders' equity             2,901,315    640,212
$10,735,698  $ 8,465,026
OTC had net losses of approximately $166,000, $1,468,000 and $2,261,000
for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively. During
1997, the Company investment in OTC was reduced to zero due to the
recognition of the Company pro rata share of OTC operating losses. As
the Company has no current financial commitments to OTC, the Company will
not record additional losses on its investment until future operating income
from OTC surpasses the cumulative unrecorded operating losses or until any
contingent payment obligations, discussed above, are required. As of
December 31, 1998, the Company had cumulative unrecorded operating losses
from OTC of approximately $1,318,000.

Accrued expenses        2,806,093    6,757,356
$34,474,758   $37,804,598

The loans payable are collateralized by most of JLM inventory and
accounts receivable. As of December 31, 1997 and 1998, JLM had a total of
approximately $72,100,000 and $125,000,000, respectively, of credit
facilities available with various financial institutions of which
approximately $60,172,000 and $95,116,000, respectively, was unused.
Additionally, as of December 31, 1997 and 1998, JLM had guaranteed vendor
letters of credit of approximately $5,964,000 and $12,836,000, respectively.
In December 1997, the Company completed the refinancing of certain of its
revolving loan agreements and replaced it with an unsecured $30 million line
of credit the LOC. Under terms of the LOC, $15 million of the LOC will
be restricted to funding future acquisitions with terms that will expire on
November 1, 2003. The remaining $15 million will be used to fund working
capital needs with terms that will expire on November 1, 2001. The interest
on the LOC will accrue at the bank prime rate less 1/2 percent. As of
December 31, 1998, there was $60 million outstanding under the LOC.
During 1998, the Company negotiated additional lines of credit with two
new financial institutions that are renewable each year in the amount of
$520 million. These lines of credit are to be used primarily for the
Company international subsidiaries. The lines of credit are unused and are
secured by accounts receivable and inventory.
JLM loans payable contain certain financial covenants which must be met
with respect to, among other things, minimum consolidated net income levels,
minimum current ratio and debt service. JLM was not in compliance with
certain of such financial covenants as of December 31, 1998 related to
quarterly income levels. With respect to such noncompliance, the Company
received a waiver from the respective financial institutions. Certain
provisions of the loans payable to which JLM is subject restricts JLM
ability to pay dividends. 8.  LONG-TERM DEBT

9. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
JLM has loans payable to its majority stockholder of $905,148 at December
31, 1997 and 1998. The loan payable bears interest at the prime rate, which
was 85% and 775% at December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively, and matures
on January 1, 2000. Additionally, 
39
the Company has approximately $1,700,000 of miscellaneous receivables owed
by the majority stockholder. These items are netted together and included as
part of other accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet.
In 1996, JLM purchased approximately $319,000 of chemical products from a
joint venture partnership owned 50% by Kemlink, L.L.C., a Delaware Limited
Liability company, of which the majority stockholder of JLM is a 97% owner.
All purchases in 1996 were at prices comparable to those paid to unrelated
parties. In addition, during 1996, JLM sold approximately $1,260,000 of
chemical products to Kemlink J.V. Effective December 31, 1996, the Company
ceased doing business with both Kemlink J.V. and Kemlink, L.L.C. due to the
termination of such entities by their partners.
In 1997, the Company entered into an agreement for sale and purchase of
common stock held by the majority stockholder of JLM and an unrelated third
party to purchase for a total purchase price of approximately $125 million
all of the issued and outstanding shares of Aurora. Under the terms of the
agreement, the Company purchased from the majority owner of JLM his 80%
ownership interest in Aurora for a $10 million promissory note that matures
on June 1, 2002 and bears interest at a rate of 100% per annum. The other
shareholder of Aurora received consideration of $250,000 for the purchase of
his ownership interest. Of such amount, $150,000 was paid at closing in cash
and $100,000 was paid by a three year promissory note which bears interest
at the prime rate and is payable in three equal annual installments. During
1998, the Company repaid the entire outstanding balance due to the unrelated
third party.
In 1996 and 1997, the Company leased chemical tank railcars from Phoenix,
a Connecticut corporation of which sole owner is the majority stockholder is
the majority stockholder of JLM. The Company made payments in 1996 and 1997
to Phoenix in respect of such leases of approximately $203,000 and $6,000,
respectively. In 1997, the Company entered into an agreement for sale and
purchase of common stock with JLM majority stockholder to purchase for a
total purchase price of $500,000 all of the issued and outstanding shares of
Phoenix. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company purchased the
majority stockholder of JLM ownership interest in Phoenix for $500,000, of
which $250,000 was offset against advances owed to the Company by the
majority stockholder of JLM and $250,000 paid by means of a promissory note
that matures on June 1, 2002 and bears interest at a rate of 100% per
annum.
The Aurora and Phoenix transactions described above have been accounted
for as a combination of entities under common control using historical
amounts.

Net deferred tax liability   $3,949,910  $5,517,407
The net change in the total valuation allowance for the year ended
December 31, 1997 and 1998 was an increase of approximately $154,000 and
$1,717,000, respectively. The valuation allowance was established to reduce
the deferred tax assets booked for foreign net operating losses, reserves
and intangible assets generated from Venezuelan and Holland operations.
At December 31, 1997 and 1998, there were Venezuelan NOL of
approximately $621,000 and $1,223,000, respectively, available to offset
future foreign taxable income. These net operating losses expire in various
years after 2000. At December 31, 1997 and 1998, there were Holland NOL of
approximately $535,000 and $3,186,000, respectively, that may be carried
forward indefinitely.
JLM effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal income tax
rate of 34% for the fiscal years ended December 31                                      1996   1997   1998

The Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S.
subsidiaries, which reflect full provision for non-U.S. income taxes, to
expand its international operations.
41
Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. income taxes that might be
payable upon repatriation of such earnings. In the event any earnings of
non-U.S. subsidiaries are repatriated, the Company will provide U.S. income
taxes upon repatriation of such earnings which will be offset by applicable
foreign tax credits, subject to certain limitations.
11.  TREASURY STOCK AND STOCK SPLIT
Chemical Trading, S.L. Trading, JLM Spanish distributor, was
indebted to JLM pursuant to an arrangement in which JLM pays the
distributor operating expenses. JLM treats the difference between such
payments made by JLM and the amount of commissions and other amounts due to
the distributor in respect of his activities on behalf of JLM as a loan by
JLM to the distributor. Such indebtedness was carried on an open account
basis and in July 1996, $522,200 was repaid without interest through the
sale to JLM at fair market value of 48 shares 267,264 shares after giving
effect to the stock split in July 1997 of common stock owned by Trading
owner. On July 3, 1997, JLM approved the retirement of the shares of common
stock held in treasury by the Company and a stock split resulting in an
exchange of 1 share for 5,568 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.
All share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted for this
split. Effective October 1, 1998, $500,000 owed by Trading was repaid
without interest through the sale to JLM at fair market value of 90,909
shares of common stock owned by Trading owner.
Effective January 1, 1998, the Company purchased 3,290 shares of common
stock from certain officers of the Company valued at $72,000. The Company
entered into the transaction in order to assume certain tax liabilities
related to the vested portion of the restricted stock received by the
certain officers.
On October 16, 1998, the Company Board of Directors approved a Stock
Repurchase Program the Program whereby the Company can purchase up to
500,000 shares of its common stock. During the fourth quarter of 1998, the
Company purchased approximately 330,000 shares of its common stock for
approximately $1,818,000 under the Program.
12.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
JLM is obligated under operating leases with remaining non-cancelable
terms of a year or more for office equipment, storage facilities and
automobiles. The approximate minimum annual rentals under these leases at
December 31, 1998 are as follows            1999              $279,135
2000              250,552
2001              394,842
2002               18,040
2003               7,150
Total minimum lease payments  $949,719
Total rental expenses for all operating leases approximated $1,875,000,
$1,540,000 and $1,588,000 for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and
1998, respectively.
42
At December 31, 1998, JLM is obligated to make future minimum payments of
$115,750 in 1999 under a license agreement for the use of the cumene
catalysts at its manufacturing facility.
JLM is subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws,
rules, regulations and ordinances concerning emissions to the air,
discharges to surface and subsurface waters, and the generation, handling,
storage, transportation, treatment, disposal and import and export of
hazardous materials. JLM has engaged environmental counsel for four of their
facilities: the JLM Chemicals, Inc., Blue Island Illinois facility, the JLM
Terminals, Inc. facility, JLM Real Estate, Inc. property and the Polychem
facility. Regarding the JLM Chemicals facility, JLM believes that the low
levels of various organic compounds detected in the soil and groundwater at
the facility are the result of historical use of the facility prior to the
acquisition by JLM and/or migration from neighboring facilities. JLM also
believes that the likelihood of either state or federal environmental
regulatory agencies seeking remediation in the near term is low, based on
the location of the facility, the character of the area each of which are
factors in assessing risk and the fact that the site is pending removal
from the federal list of contaminated sites. Regarding the JLM Terminals,
Inc. facility and the JLM Realty property, JLM believes that ultimate
liability for remediation of soil and groundwater contamination rests with
the previous owner of the facility and/or a neighboring facility. In 1998,
the Company assumed from the previous owner of both the JLM Terminal, Inc.
and JLM Realty, Inc. the implementation of state approved Remedial Action
Plans RAPs to address onsite petroleum contamination at the sites.
Compliance with the RAPs does not foreseeably require any capital
expenditures and the Company believes that the owners of the neighboring
properties may bear a significant portion of the responsibility or any
additional remediation. Regarding the Polychem facility, levels of organic
compounds slightly in excess of regulatory thresholds were detected in the
ground water. JLM addressed the problem and recent analytical results show
the levels of contamination have decreased to acceptable levels.
Accordingly, JLM has requested that state authorities permit closure of the
remediation of the Polychem facility. JLM does not believe that a material
amount of funds will be required to complete remediation at any of the
sites. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued any amounts related to the
remediation of any of the sites.
On December 12, 1996, JLM entered into consulting and non-competition
agreements with two independent third parties. The terms of the consulting
agreements are from January 3, 1997 through December 31, 2003 and JLM is
committed to pay $130,000 per year, payable semi-annually beginning January
1, 1997 through December 31, 2002 and $200,000 on January 1, 2003. The terms
of the non-competition agreements will be from January 1, 1997 through
December 31, 2006 and JLM is committed to $100,000 per year, payable
semi-annually from July 1, 1997 through December 31, 2002 and $270,000 on
January 1, 2003. As of December 31, 1998, JLM has advanced $930,000 to the
third parties and, in conjunction with entering into the consulting and
non-competition agreements, these amounts shall be satisfied by setting them
off against the amounts owed by the third parties to JLM. As of December 31,
1997, the $240,000 advance has been recorded in other current assets-net and
the remaining $230,000 advance is recorded in prepaid expenses and other
current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. During 1996,
the third parties signed promissory notes aggregating $470,000 and bearing
no interest for the monies that had been advanced.
During 1997, the Internal Revenue Service IRS concluded its federal
income tax examination of JLM 1988 through 1990 and 1992 through 1994 tax
years. JLM subsequently
43
made payments to the IRS as a result of these examinations. The settlement
of these IRS examinations did not materially affect the Company financial
condition or results of operations in 1997 or 1998.
On March 10, 1998, the Company executed a long-term purchase agreement
with Solutia, Inc. Solutia to purchase on a take-or-pay basis phenol to
be produced at a phenol plant to be built on the Gulf Coast of the United
States. Under terms of the agreement, the Company was required to advance
over three years $35 million to Solutia as a partial prepayment for future
inventory purchases. The prepayment was scheduled to be paid as follows: $5
million on or about December 31, 1998, $65 million in equal quarterly
payments in 1999 and the remaining balance in equal quarterly payments in
2000. Under the contract, Solutia is required to sell 125 million pounds of
phenol per year to JLM for 15 years at a specified price outlined in the
agreement with a credit on a per pound basis for the advancement mentioned
above. Construction of the plant was anticipated to commence in the
beginning of 1999 and phenol production was anticipated to begin at the
plant in the fourth quarter of 2000. The agreement also provides that if the
Company available borrowing capacity under its aggregate credit facilities
is less than the total amount of the advance payments owed to Solutia,
Solutia may require the Company to deliver to Solutia an executed,
irrevocable bank guaranty equal to the total amount of the advance payments
owed to Solutia. Due to market conditions, the project and any required
payments were suspended prior to December 31, 1998 through the mutual
consent of both Solutia and the Company.
13.  EARNINGS PER SHARE
As described in Note 17, the Company Board of Directors adopted formal
plans to discontinue certain segments of its business. Additionally during
1997, the Company repaid certain debt from proceeds received from the initial
public offering of its Common Stock in July 1997. As part of the repayment of
the debt, the Company incurred $386,000 of extraordinary loss see Note 18.
Accordingly, the following table illustrates the impact of such items on
income per share for the years ended December 31                   1996    1997    1998
Basic earnings per share:
Discontinued operations   $ 009  $ 003  $ 000
Extraordinary item        --    007   000
Diluted earnings per share:              
Discontinued operations   $ 009  $ 003  $ 000
Extraordinary item       000   007   000
The basic earnings per share calculation is based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding adjusted for actual shares issued or
reacquired during the period. In conjunction with the initial public
offering, the Company issued 411,500 options to employees of the Company at
an exercise price of $10 per share of which 369,165 shares, reduced by
employee turnover, were still outstanding as of December 31, 1998. The
average market price of the Company common stock was greater than the
exercise price of the options throughout 1997.
The following table illustrates information concerning the options issued
under the Company LTIP for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998                    44
1997       1998
Options granted                 411,500      6,000
Options vested                   --      129,399
Options exercised                 --          Options cancelled                 3,400      43,935
Options expired                  --          The average market price of the Company common stock was less than the
exercise price of the options throughout the majority of 1998. The impact of
the dilutive effect of options included in the calculation of diluted
weighted average shares outstanding is illustrated below for the year ended
December 31                         1996    1997    1998
Basic weighted shares outstanding    4,877,568  5,752,579  7,038,321
Dilutive effect of outstanding options    --    37,409                                  Diluted weighted shares outstanding   4,877,568  5,789,988  7,038,321
There was no dilution of earnings per share for either 1996 or 1998.
14. PROFIT-SHARING PLAN
The Company has a defined contribution profit-sharing plan covering
substantially all of its employees. The Company contributes 100% of the
contribution of eligible employees, up to a maximum amount of 6% of the
employees' compensation. The Company contribution rate is determined
annually at the beginning of each plan year. The costs for this plan were
approximately $278,000, $348,000 and $395,000 in 1996, 1997 and 1998,
respectively.
Included in selling, general and administrative expenses are
profit-sharing bonuses paid to employees based on performance or formulas.
The bonuses of the Company for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and
1998 were approximately $581,000, $529,000 and $656,000, respectively.
15. POLYCHEM LTD., INC.
During 1994, the Company formed and held a 95% ownership of a new
subsidiary, JLM Acquisition, Inc. On August 8, 1994, JLM Acquisition, Inc.
purchased substantially all the business assets of Polychem, a chemical dyes
distributor in Dalton, Georgia, for $900,000 in cash and a promissory note
for $1,240,000 payable in semi-annual installments over five years.
On October 26, 1995, JLM completed the sale of substantially all the
operating assets of Polychem for cash of $882,000 and the assumption of
related liabilities. The purchaser had an irrevocable option for a period of
three years to buy the Polychem real property for $1; however, such option
was not exercised by the purchaser. Therefore, the Company has retained
title to this real property.
45
16. ACQUISITIONS OF BROWNING, THE TOLSON GROUP AND INQUINOSA

and Tolson Asia Pte., Ltd, a Singapore company through the purchase of all
of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the three companies,

note that accrues interest at the LIBOR rate plus 1%. The promissory note is
payable in five semi-annual installments of $350,000 with a lump-sum payment

Holding. B.V. contributed approximately $74 million to bring the combined
negative equity of the Tolson Group to zero.

sell the non-core business segments, consisting of Polychem see Note 15,
MAC Enterprises, Inc. Enterprises and JLM Stables, Inc. Stables
collectively the Segments, as part of JLM strategic focus on marketing
and manufacturing of commodity and specialty chemicals. The Segments are
accounted for as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements, which requires the plan of disposal to be carried out
within one year.
In December 1996, JLM entered into a plan to sell the assets of both
Enterprises and Stables. Based on management review of the assumptions
used in determining the estimated gain or loss from the disposals of
Enterprises and Stables, JLM recorded a provision of $9,050, net of income
taxes, for the loss on disposal during 1996. The Company does not allocate
any corporate overhead to either Enterprises or Stables.
In May 1997, the Company completed the sale of the majority of the assets
of Enterprises for $1,075,000 cash. The sale resulted in an additional loss
of $29,054 and the proceeds of the sale were used to repay the entire
outstanding loan balance of Enterprises of approximately $905,000.
The operating results of the discontinued operations, which includes
interest expense associated with Enterprises and Stables, are summarized as
follows for the years ended December 31                                1996     1997     1998

approximately $132 million incurred to finance the acquisition of the Blue
Island, Illinois facility and related capital expenditures associated with
the QMAX Catalyst technology and ii approximately $08 million incurred to
finance the acquisition of the Cape Fear, North Carolina, Terminal,
respectively. As a result of the early extinguishment of debt, the Company
recognized approximately $386,000 of extraordinary loss consisting primarily
of prepayment penalties, net of income tax benefits of approximately
$257,000.
19. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
On July 2, 1997, the Company approved a long-term incentive plan the
LTIP whereby 750,000 shares of Common Stock are reserved for issuance
under the LTIP. Under the LTIP, restricted stock, incentive stock options,
nonqualified stock options and stock appreciation rights or any combination
thereof may be granted to JLM employees.
On July 23, 1997, the Company granted 411,500 options under the LTIP to
the employees of JLM at an exercise price of $10 per share. During 1998, the
Company issued 5,000 options with an exercise price of $1050 per share and
1,000 options with an exercise price of $1100 per share to various
employees under the LTIP. These options vest ratably over a three-year
period. The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No.
123. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the options
in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Had compensation cost
for the options been determined based on the fair value at the grant date
for awards in 1997 and 1998 consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123,
JLM net income and income per share for the year ended December 31, 1997
and 1998 would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below                            1997      1998
Net income - as reported           $  6,493,754  $  5,715,350
Net income - pro forma              6,318,137    4,793,043
Basic net income per share - as reported       113      081
Basic net income per share - pro forma        110      068
Diluted net income per share - as reported      112      081
Diluted net income per share - pro forma       109      068
None of the options granted under the LTIP vested during 1997. During
1998, 123,055 options previously granted vested under the LTIP. The fair
value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in 1997 and 1998, respectively: dividend yield
of 0%and 0%; expected volatility of 59% and 67%; risk-free interest rate
of 57% and 469%; and expected lives of 100 years.
Concurrent with the initial public offering, the Company awarded 47,000
shares of restricted stock, with a four-year vesting period to certain
officers and employees. The Company recognizes expense related to the
issuance of such restricted stock ratably over the vesting period.
49

Purchase Plan whereby an aggregate of 75,000 shares of Common Stock are
reserved for issuance under the plan. Under the Purchase Plan, all employees
