audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

MapInfo Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in thousands, except share data
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Operations
MapInfo designs, develops, markets, licenses and supports software and data products, application development tools, and industry-focused solutions, together with a range of consulting, training and technical support services.
These products are sold through multiple distribution channels, including an indirect channel of value-added resellers and distributors, a corporate account sales force, and a telemarketing sales group. The Company products are translated into 20
languages and sold in 58 countries throughout the world. MapInfo markets its products worldwide through sales offices in North America, Europe and Australia, and throughout the rest of Europe and the Asia-Pacific region through exclusive and non-exclusive
distribution relationships.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MapInfo Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For the purpose of the cash flows statements, the Company defines cash and cash equivalents as cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market as determined on the average cost method and consist primarily of computer media, user manuals and software packaging supplies.
Short-term Investments
The Company short-term investments consist of debt securities with maturity dates of one year or less. In accordance with SFAS No. 115, debt securities have been classified in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as
held-to-maturity securities and are reported at amortized cost because the Company has the positive intent and the ability to hold these debt securities to maturity. Market value is determined by quoted market prices.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets two to seven years for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for
tax purposes. When assets are sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of, the applicable costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized.
Product Development Costs
Product development costs, including product enhancements, are capitalized after technological feasibility has been established. These costs are reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value and are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over two to five years, the estimated economic life of the products. Annual amortization under the straight-line method is greater than the ratio of current gross revenue to total expected product revenues method. 
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Intangible assets are being amortized over the estimated lives using the straight-line method over five to ten years. The Company
continually evaluates the existence of impairment on the basis of whether the intangible asset is fully recoverable from projected, undiscounted net cash flows of the related business activity.
Revenue Recognition
Product revenue: Revenue from software and data product licenses and technology development fees is recognized upon the later of shipment of product or completion of significant obligations to customers, provided collectibility
of the resulting receivable is probable.
Original Equipment Manufacturer OEM Revenue: Revenue from products licensed to original equipment manufacturers is recorded when the product has been shipped and all obligations of the Company have been satisfied, provided
collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable.
Value Added Reseller VAR Sales: Revenue from product sales to distributors and VAR is recorded when related products are shipped, provided collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable.
Postcontract customer support PCS: PCS, inclusive of technical support and maintenance, may be bundled with an initial licensing fee or sold separately. In either case, the fair value of the PCS arrangement is recognized
ratably over the term of the agreement, generally over a one to two year period, provided collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable.
Services revenue: Revenue from services such as training and consulting are recognized as the services are performed, provided collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable.
Reserve for Returns
The Company as a matter of policy provides the buyer the right to return certain products within a stated period ranging from 30-60 days, for a refund of the purchase price or replacement of the product. Accordingly, the
Company accrues for estimated future returns.
Advertising Costs
The Company expenses all advertising costs as they are incurred.
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable for future years to differences between financial statement and tax basis of existing
assets and liabilities. The effect of tax rate changes on deferred taxes is recognized in the income tax provision in the period that includes the enactment date.
Business tax credits are recorded by the flow-through method of accounting, whereby they are applied as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the credits are utilized.
Foreign Currency
The assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates, and the income statements are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Gains or losses
resulting from translating non-U.S. currency financial statements are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income. The Company exposure to foreign currency
risk is mitigated, in part, by the fact that it incurs certain operating costs in the same foreign currencies in which revenues are denominated.
Computation of Earnings Per Share
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128 - Earnings Per Share, earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and diluted common equivalent shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted common equivalent shares consist of stock options using the treasury stock method. 
Stock Split
During January 2000 and September 2000, the outstanding shares of the Company common stock were split three-for-two, which were effected in the form of stock dividends. All prior share amounts have been restated to reflect
the stock splits.
Segment Information
In 1999, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131 - Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 supercedes SFAS No. 14, Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise. Under the new
standard the Company is required to use the management approach to reporting its segments. The management approach designates that the internal organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the
source of the Company segments. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncement
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and
hedging activities. It requires that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value.
In June 2000, SFAS No. 133 was amended by SFAS No. 138 Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities. Both SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 138 are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.
Accordingly, the Company will adopt SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 138 effective October 1, 2000. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 138 will have a material effect on the Company financial position or results of
operations. 
In December 1999, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, which is effective no later than the fourth fiscal quarter of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15,
1999. SAB No. 101 clarifies the SEC views related to revenue recognition and disclosure. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SAB No. 101 will have a material effect on the Company financial position or results of operations. 
In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation - an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25 FIN 44. FIN 44 clarifies the
application of APB Opinion No. 25 and among other issues clarifies the following: the definition of an employee for purposes of applying APB Opinion No. 25; the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan; the accounting
consequences of various modifications to the terms of previously fixed stock options or awards; and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination. The Company adopted FIN 44 effective July 1, 2000.

considered realizable could be reduced in the future if estimates of future taxable income are reduced.

15.Segment Information 
The Company operations involve the design, development, marketing, licensing and support of software and data products, application development tools, and industry-specific solutions, together with a range of consulting, training
and technical support services.
The Company conducts business globally and is managed geographically. The Company management relies on an internal management accounting system. This system includes revenue and cost information by geographic location. Revenues are
attributed to a geographic location based on the origination of the order from the customer. The Company management makes financial decisions and allocates resources based on the information it receives from this internal system. Based on the criteria
set forth in SFAS No. 131, the Company has three reportable segments: the Americas, EAME Europe, Africa and the Middle East and Asia-Pacific.
Summarized financial information by segment for 2000, 1999 and 1998, as taken from the internal management accounting system discussed above, is as follows September 30 2000 1999 1998 Revenue Americas 58,065  40,019  30,675 EAME 27,257 24,861 19,540 Asia-Pacific 10,838 9,476 10,388 Asia-Pacific Total Revenue 96,160  74,356  60,603 Total Revenue Operating income Americas 23,389  13,780  8,703 EAME 8,201 6,902 5,015 Asia-Pacific 2,764 3,121 5,160 Corporate adjustments 23,169 18,073 15,704  Total operating income 11,185  5,730  3,174 Depreciation and amortization included in operating income consists of Americas 3,625  3,158  2,970 EAME 1,459 1,380 1,079 Asia-Pacific 223 225 265 Total depreciation and amortization 5,307  4,763  4,314 The operating income by segment above differs from the amounts recognized under generally accepted accounting principles because the Company does not allocate certain corporate costs for research and development, marketing, and general
and administrative activities to the geographic locations. The table above reconciles the operating income by segment to operating income as reported on the Income Statements by including such adjustments.
Enterprise-wide information is provided in accordance with SFAS No. 131. Geographic revenue information is based on the ordering location of the customer. Long-lived assets information is based on the physical location of the assets.
The following is revenue and long-lived assets information for geographic locations.
