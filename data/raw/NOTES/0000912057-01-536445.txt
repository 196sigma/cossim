Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements             21                    15 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT To the Board of Directors of
KMG Chemicals, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of KMG Chemicals,
Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of July 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2001. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of KMG Chemicals, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of July 31, 2001 and 2000, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for the three years in the period ended July 31,
2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
GENERAL - KMG Chemicals, Inc. the Company is principally involved in
the sale and manufacture of specialty chemicals in niche markets. At the
present time, the company sells three wood preserving chemicals,
pentachlorophenol penta, creosote and sodium pentacholorphenate
sodium penta, and an herbicide product consisting of monosodium and
disodium methanearsonic acids MSMA. Penta-manufacturing operations are
conducted through KMG de Mexico KMEX, a Mexican corporation and 9998
percent owned subsidiary, at a plant in Matamoros, Mexico. The penta plant
began operations in 1986 and was moved to a new location in Matamoros in
May 1997. The Company has two main suppliers of creosote, which it sells
throughout the United States.
The Company MSMA agricultural chemicals product line was acquired form
Zeneca Ag Products, Inc. Zeneca in October 2000. The MSMA production
facility acquired from Zeneca was relocated adjacent to the Company
penta manufacturing facility and reassembled. The Company MSMA
herbicides are sold under the name Bueno-Registered Trademark- 6 in the
United States to protect cotton crops, primarily in the southern
cotton-growing states and in California, and under the name
Ansar-Registered Trademark- 66 to state agencies to control highway weed
growth.
The historical financial information of the Company reflects the
historical results of KMG-Bernuth KMG and KMEX as a result of a
reverse merger of KMG with KMG-B, Inc. KMG-B in October 1996. KMG-B
was incorporated in the state of Texas in 1992 under the name Water Point
Manufacturing, Inc. Water Point. Water Point adopted fresh-start
accounting as of October 23, 1996 and subsequently changed its name to
KMG-B. On October 15, 1996, pursuant to a stock exchange agreement dated
September 13, 1996, KMG-B issued 6,510,000 shares of common stock
approximately 93 percent of its issued and outstanding common stock in
exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of
KMG. KMG-B also issued 352,474 shares of common stock to other
shareholders as payment for certain services for KMG-B in connection with
the stock exchange agreement and in conjunction with other services.
During 1998, the Company changed its name to KMG Chemicals, Inc.
The Company significant accounting policies are as follows    PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of KMG Chemicals, KMG-Bernuth, and KMEX. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - The Company considers all investments with
original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents.
INVENTORIES - Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost
is determined using the first-in first-out FIFO method.
21    PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT - Property, plant, and equipment is stated
at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Major renewals and
betterments are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as
incurred.
INCOME TAXES - Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined
using the asset and liability method in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
established for future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and
their tax bases.
EARNINGS PER SHARE - Basic earnings per common share amounts are
calculated using the average number of common shares outstanding during
each period. Diluted earnings per share assume the exercise of all stock
options having exercise prices less than the average market price of the
common stock using the treasury stock method.
CURRENCY TRANSLATION - The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the
Company foreign operations. For those operations, remeasurements to U.S.
dollars from currency translations are included in the statement of
income.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION - The Company has adopted SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under SFAS No. 123, the Company
is permitted to either record expenses for stock options and other
employee compensation plans based on their fair value at the date of grant
or to continue to apply its current accounting policy under Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB No. 25 and recognize compensation
expense, if any, based on the intrinsic value of the equity instrument at
the measurement date. The Company elected to continue following APB No. 25
for stock options granted to employees; however, the Company accounts for
stock options granted to non-employees under the provisions of SFAS 123.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS - For financial statement purposes, intangible assets
are being amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets see Note 6.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - The carrying value of financial
instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and
accounts payable approximate fair value because of the relatively short
maturity of these instruments. The notes receivable, including the current
portion, are of a related-party nature, and it is not practicable to
estimate their fair value. The fair value of the Company debt at July
31, 2001 and 2000 was estimated to be the same as its carrying value since
the debt obligations bear interest at a rate consistent with current
market rates.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISKS - Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist
principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Although
the amount of credit exposure to any one institution may exceed federally
insured amounts, the Company limits its cash investments to high-quality
financial institutions in order to minimize its credit risk. With respect
to accounts receivable, such receivables are primarily from wood-treating
manufacturers located worldwide. The Company extends credit based on an
evaluation of the customer financial condition, generally without
requiring collateral. Exposure to losses on receivables is dependent on
each customer financial condition.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS - Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, became effective for the Company beginning August 1, 2001.
SFAS No. 133, as amended and interpreted, establishes accounting and
reporting standard for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging
activities. Under SFAS 133, certain contracts that were not formerly                    22    considered derivatives may now meet the definition of a derivative.
Management does not believe the adoption of SFAS 133 has a significant
impact on the financial position, results of operation, or cash flows of
the Company because it currently has no contracts that qualify as
derivatives under the provisions of this new standard. The Financial
Accounting Standards Board and the Derivatives Implementation Group
continue to discuss several issues that, once decided, could have
additional impact on the Company financial statements.
In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 141 SFAS 141, Business Combinations. SFAS 141 requires the
purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after
June 30, 2001 and eliminates the pooling-of-interests method. The Company
does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 141 will have a significant
impact on its financial statements.
In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142 SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which is
effective January 1, 2002. SFAS 142 requires, among other things, the
discontinuance of goodwill amortization. In addition, the standard
includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing
intangibles as goodwill, reassessment of the useful lives of existing
recognized intangibles, reclassification of certain intangibles out of
previously reported goodwill and the identification of reporting units for
purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill. SFAS 142
also requires the Company to complete a transitional goodwill impairment
test six months from the date of adoption. The Company is currently
assessing, but has not yet determined, the impact of SFAS 142 on its
financial position and results of operations.
RECLASSIFICATIONS - Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have
been made to conform to current year presentation.

On October 3, 2000, the Company acquired the monosodium/-disodium
methanearsonic acid MSMA herbicides product line see Note 6 and its
manufacturing facility from Zeneca Limited, for a total acquisition cost
of $23 million. The MSMA manufacturing facility, originally located in
Houston, Texas, is being dismantled and reassembled adjacent to the
Company penta manufacturing facility in Matamoros, Mexico. Included in
construction-in-progress at July 31, 2001 are costs of approximately $33
million related to the purchase and relocation of the MSMA manufacturing
facility.
Depreciation is principally computed using a straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation expense was $336,060,
$333,712 and $310,344 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The estimated
useful lives of classes of assets are as follows       ASSET DESCRIPTION             LIFE YEARS
Building                  15 to 30
Plant                   10 to 18
Equipment                 3 to 10
Leasehold improvements           5 to 8 4.  FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT
Monetary assets and liabilities and income items for KMEX are remeasured
to U.S. dollars at current rates, and certain assets notably plant and
production equipment are remeasured at historical rates. Expense items
for KMEX are remeasured at average monthly rates of exchange except for
depreciation and amortization expense. All gains and losses from currency
remeasurement for KMEX are included in operations. Foreign currency
remeasurement resulted in an aggregate exchange gain of $11,705 in 2001
and $15,416 in 1999 and an aggregate exchange loss of $1,901 in 2000.                    24

Total                               $8,607,531   $7,889,455
On June 30, 1998, the Company entered into a long-term supply contract to
purchase creosote a wood-treating chemical from Allied Signal, Inc.
Allied. At the same time, the Company purchased certain intangible
assets from Allied pertaining to creosote sales and distribution. The
Company paid Allied $4,000,000 and $4,500,000 for entering into the supply
contract and for the intangible assets, respectively. The supply contract
is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a 10-year term, which is
the initial term of the contract. The intangible assets, including
Allied creosote customer list, one customer contract, certain rail car
leases, and Allied rights in creosote product registrations, are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over a 15-year term which approximates
the life of the assets purchased.
During 1991, the Company entered into a technology-licensing agreement
resulting in the granting to the Company of an exclusive worldwide right
and license to use and sublease certain proprietary and sales information
and to manufacture and sell certain products for an indefinite period of
time. Total cost to the Company for this license was $320,000, which is
being amortized on a straight-line basis over a 15-year term which
approximates the patent life of the products represented by this
agreement.
On October 3, 2000, the Company acquired various intangible assets, such
as brand names and customer lists, in connection with the purchase of the
MSMA herbicides product line from Zeneca Limited see Note 3.
Approximately $115 million of the total $23 million acquisition cost was
allocated to the intangible assets purchased. These costs are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over a 15-year term, which approximates
the life of the assets purchased.
7.  LONG-TERM DEBT
Effective August 1, 1996, the Company entered into a revolving
line-of-credit agreement with a bank that provides for borrowings of up to
$3,500,000. The borrowing base under this agreement is limited by a
formula defined in the agreement based on the amount of receivables and
inventory. Interest payments will be due monthly. The line of credit is
subject to a one-fourth percent unused line fee and is secured by the
Company receivables, inventory, and general intangibles. The loan
agreement includes, among other things, restrictions on equity investments
and loans made by the Company and                    26
requires the maintenance of a minimum fixed-charge coverage ratio and
minimum net worth requirements. No borrowings were outstanding under this
agreement at July 31, 2001 or 2000. The termination date of this loan
agreement is January 31, 2004.
On June 26, 1998, the Company entered into a term loan with an original
maturity date of July 1, 2005 for $6,000,000 with a bank. Starting August
1, 1998, the Company began making monthly principal and interest payments
of $91,498. This term loan is secured by the Company receivables,
inventory, and general intangibles. The interest rate of the term loan is
fixed at 732 percent per annum. At July 31, 2001, the Company was in
compliance with its various debt covenants which, among other things, has
restrictions on equity investments and loans made by the Company and
requires the maintenance of a minimum fixed-charge coverage ratio and
minimum and ratio requirements on tangible net worth.
The term loan note at July 31, 2001 matures as follows            YEAR ENDING
JULY 31,
2002        $ 939,906
2003         1,013,776
2004          600,737
Total        $2,554,419
8.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
OPERATING LEASES - The Company has noncancelable operating leases for its
office and warehouse facilities and certain transportation equipment. At
July 31, 2001, the Company was obligated under these leases for the
following future minimum lease commitments                    
2002        $ 355,316
2003          333,882
2004          251,044
Total        $ 940,242
Rent expense relating to the operating leases was $437,103, $346,138 and
$317,361 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
ENVIRONMENTAL - As a manufacturer and supplier of wood treatment products
and herbicides, the Company is subject to a variety of health, safety, and
environmental laws within the countries in which it operates. These
governments may implement new laws or regulations that amend or impose
restrictions on the sale or use of the Company raw materials and
products. In management opinion, the Company is currently in compliance
with all applicable laws and regulations, and no actions or proceedings
against the Company are known to be in process.
Producers of chemicals such as penta, creosote and MSMA are required by
the Environmental Protection Agency EPA to obtain a registration for
their products under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
Act FIFRA in order to sell those products in the United States. The
registration system requires an ongoing submission to the EPA of
substantial scientific research and testing data regarding the chemistry
and toxicology of pesticides produced by manufacturers. Under an agreement
with other industry participants, the Company shares the costs of the
research and testing required by FIFRA, as well as possible compliance
testing required by foreign governments, based on
27    relative market share. In the current year, data obtained from these tests
were consistent with historical test results and will not, in management
opinion, hinder the re-registration of the Company pesticide products.
The Company incurred expenses in connection with the FIFRA research and
testing programs of approximately $716,000, $756,000 and $721,000 in 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively. These costs are included in selling, general,
and administrative expenses.
Future costs to the Company of the research and testing programs are
difficult to quantify, since foreign governments have the authority to
amend testing protocols and/or mandate additional tests. However,
management estimates that these future costs will be approximately
$625,000 per year and intends to expense these costs as incurred.
LAWSUITS - The Company is involved in various claims and lawsuits in the
normal course of business. Management does not believe that the outcome of
any of these matters will have a materially adverse effect on the
Company consolidated financial position or results of operations.
9.  RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
During 1991, the Company entered into split-dollar insurance
arrangements with two officers/stockholders. Under these arrangements, the
Company advances funds for insurance premiums and records these advances
as a noncurrent asset. The Company has a security interest in the
insurance policies to the extent of the advances made. The security
interest is to be satisfied either from death benefit proceeds or, in the
event of termination of the arrangements, by reimbursement from the
officers/stockholders. During fiscal 1998, the arrangement with one
such officer was terminated under the provisions of a five-year employment
agreement and converted to a noninterest-bearing promissory note. As a
portion of the officer compensation under the employment agreement, the
note is being amortized to compensation expense by the Company over a
five-year period beginning January 1, 2000 see Note 6; such amortization
was $74,023 and $71,288 in 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The Company advanced funds to an officer under unsecured promissory notes
dated May 15, 1998 and July 15, 1994. The 1998 note was due in annual
installments of $28,571, plus interest at 8 percent, with installments
starting May 15, 2001. The 1994 note was due in semimonthly installments
of $1,000, including interest at 65 percent. The amount outstanding under
these notes was $0 and $428,057 at July 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
In August 1998, the Company purchased a $200,000 participation in a loan
by Sterling Bank to National Health Capital, Ltd. NHC, a limited
partnership engaged in purchasing medical receivables. In November 1998,
the Company made an additional loan of $200,000 to NHC. At the time of
these transactions, directors of the Company were directors of the general
partner of NHC, limited partners in NHC, and one director was president of
NHC. NHC ceased operations in 1999 and began the process of recovering on
its assets and winding up its business. Management believes that at that
time, and through the date that the interest in theses notes was purchased
by an officer of the Company see below, the notes receivable were
collectible. Both loans were modified and renewed as of October 1999. The
participation loan bore no interest and was due August 20, 2000. The
second loan bore no interest and was due on September 30, 2000.
On October 18, 2000, the Company completed its purchase of 180,000 shares
of the Company outstanding common stock from an officer at a price of
$500 per share, the value of the Company common stock on August 29,
2000, the date on which the Company Board of Directors approved the
transaction. In accordance with the Company desire to remove certain
related party transactions from                    28    its accounts, the proceeds from the sale were used by the officer to
purchase the Company interest in the two NHC notes referred to above,
and to repay the loans made to the officer by the Company in fiscal 1998
and 1994.
10.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has a defined contribution 401k plan covering substantially
all of its U.S. employees. The participants may contribute from 3 percent
to 15 percent of their compensation, and the Company makes matching
contributions under this plan equal to 3 percent of the participant
compensation. Company contributions to the plan totaled approximately
$30,000, $40,000 and $46,000 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
In July 2001, the Company adopted a supplemental executive retirement
plan. Only persons specifically designated by the company may be
participants in the plan. The plan is unfunded and amounts payable to
participants are general obligations of the company. The plan provides
that a participant will be paid a supplemental retirement benefit for 10
years equal to a percentage of the participant three-year average base
salary at normal retirement. The benefit payable to participants is
reduced by the equivalent actuarial value of the Company other pension
plan payments to the participant, if any, the Company 401k plan and
one-half social security benefits. Normal retirement is the earlier of age
65 and completion of 10 years credited service or age 60 with 30 years
credited service. As of July 31, 2001, none of the Company executives
were designated as a participant in the plan; however, one executive was
designated as a participant in August 2001.
11.  SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS
The Company had one significant customer in 2001, 2000 and 1999 whose
sales as a percentage of total sales were 15 percent, 12 percent and 15
percent, respectively.
12.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
The Company adopted the 1996 Stock Option Plan the Stock Plan on
October 15, 1996 and reserved 700,000 shares of its common stock for
issuance under the Stock Plan. The Stock Plan provides for the grant of
incentive stock options, as defined in Section 422 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and nonqualified stock options. The
Stock Plan will be administered either by the Company Board of Directors
or by a committee of two or more nonemployee directors. Subject to the
terms of the Stock Plan, the Board of Directors or the committee has the
authority to grant options under the Stock Plan, to amend, construe, and
interpret it, and to make all other determinations and take any and all
actions necessary or advisable for its administration. The directors,
consultants, and key employees of the Company or any subsidiary are
eligible to receive options under the Plan, which are fully vested upon
issuance, but only salaried employees of the Company or its subsidiaries
are eligible to receive incentive stock options, which vest over a
five-year period from the date of issuance.
Options will be exercisable during the period specified in each option
agreement and in accordance with a vesting schedule to be designated by
the Board of Directors or the committee. Any option agreement may provide
that options become immediately exercisable in the event of a change or
threatened change in control of the Company and in the event of certain
mergers and reorganizations of the Company. Options may be subject to
early termination within a designated period following the option holder
cessation of service with the Company.
In 2000 the Company granted an option to acquire 40,000 shares of common
stock in consideration for investor relations consulting services. These
options would have vested if before January 1, 2000 the average closing
price of the Company common stock equaled or exceeded $900 per share
for ten                    29
consecutive days, however, the options failed to vest and expired
unexercised. Also in 2000 the Company granted warrants to acquire 25,000
shares of common stock to JP Turner & Company L.L.P. for consulting
services as requested by the Company and pertaining to the evaluation of
acquisition and financing transactions and to investor relations. The
warrants are immediately exercisable at a price of $550 per share of
common stock through March 17, 2003.
In 2000, the Company granted a warrant for the purchase of 25,000 shares
of the Company common stock to Gilman Financial Corporation, a company
that employs a Director of the Company, in exchange for consulting
services with respect to developing, studying, and evaluating merger and
acquisition proposals. The warrant is immediately exercisable at a price
of $550 per share of common stock through March 6, 2009.
Stock option and warrants activity for the Company in 2001, 2000 and 1999
was as follows                        2001           2000             1999

weighted-average exercise price of $341. The remaining contractual life
of these options was approximately 79 years. At July 31, 2001, 355,829
shares were available for future option grants.
The weighted-average fair value of options granted during 2001, 2000 and
1999 was $103,176, $114,314 and $95,488, respectively. The effect of these
options would have decreased basic and diluted EPS by $01 per share in
2001 and $02 per share during 2000 and 1999, respectively. Fair value of
the options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions for fiscal years 2001,
2000 and 1999                         2001   2000    1999
