Compliance With Section 16a of The Exchange Act of 1934
Section 16a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the
Company officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of
ServiceMaster shares, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership
with the Securities and Exchange Commission the Commission and the New York
Stock Exchange. The Commission regulations require certain officers, directors
and greater-than-ten-percent shareholders to furnish to the Company copies of
all Section 16a forms that they file. During 1999, the Company received
Section 16a forms from such officers and directors. As of January 1, 2000, the
Company did not have any shareholders with an interest greater than ten percent.
Based solely on a review of the copies of Section 16a forms received
by the Company or on written representations from certain reporting persons that
no Form 5 was required for those persons, the Company believes that during 1999
the officers and directors of the Company complied with applicable filing
requirements.
