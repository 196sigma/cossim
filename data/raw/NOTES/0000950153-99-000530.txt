REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
CSK Auto Corporation
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity deficit, and cash
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CSK
Auto Corporation and subsidiary the Company at January 31, 1999 and February
1, 1998, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended January 31, 1999, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CSK Auto Corporation is a holding company. At January 31, 1999, CSK Auto
Corporation had no business activity other than its investment in CSK Auto,
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary Auto. On a consolidated basis, CSK Auto
Corporation and subsidiary are referred to herein as the Company.
CSK Auto, Inc. is a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts and
accessories. At January 31, 1999, the Company operated 807 stores in 13 Western
states as a fully integrated company under three brand names: Checker Auto
Parts, founded in 1969 and operating in the Southwestern and Rocky Mountain
states; Schuck Auto Supply, founded in 1917 and operating in the Pacific
Northwest; and Kragen Auto Parts, founded in 1947 and operating primarily in
California.
NOTE 1 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CSK Auto
Corporation, Auto and Auto wholly-owned subsidiaries, Schuck Distribution
Co. and Kragen Auto Supply Co., for all years presented. In addition, the
accounts of TRK Socal, Inc. the former Trak West stores are included in the
accompanying financial statements from December 9, 1997, the date of acquisition
see Note 3. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in
consolidation. On April 8, 1998, Schuck Distribution Co., Kragen Auto Supply
Co. and TRK Socal, Inc. were merged into Auto.
FISCAL YEAR
The Company fiscal year end is on the Sunday nearest to January 31 of the
following calendar year. The fiscal years ended January 31, 1999 fiscal 1998
and February 1, 1998 fiscal 1997 each consisted of 52 weeks, while the
fiscal year ended February 2, 1997 fiscal 1996 consisted of 53 weeks.
CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash equivalents consist primarily of certificates of deposit with
maturities of three months or less when purchased.
RECEIVABLES
Receivables are primarily comprised of amounts due from vendors for rebates
or allowances and from commercial sales customers.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration
of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade
receivables. As of January 31, 1999, the Company had cash and cash equivalents
on deposit with a major financial institution that were in excess of FDIC
insured limits. Historically, the Company has not experienced any loss of its
cash and cash equivalents due to such concentration of credit risk.
The Company does not hold collateral to secure payment of its trade
accounts receivable. However, management performs ongoing credit evaluations of
its customers' financial condition and provides an allowance for estimated
potential losses. Exposure to credit loss is limited to the carrying amount.
INVENTORIES AND COST OF SALES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, cost being
determined utilizing the last-in, first-out method. Cost of sales includes
product cost, net of earned vendor rebates, discounts and allowances. The
Company recognizes vendor rebates, discounts and allowances based on the terms
of the underlying
30
32
CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
agreements. Such amounts may be amortized over the life of the applicable
agreements or recognized as inventory is sold. Certain operating and
administrative costs associated with purchasing and handling of inventory are
capitalized in inventories. The amounts of such costs included in inventories as
of January 31, 1999 and February 1, 1998 were approximately $179 million and
$159 million, respectively. The replacement cost of inventories approximated
$3567 million and $3162 million at January 31, 1999 and February 1, 1998,
respectively.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property, equipment and purchased software are recorded at cost.
Depreciation and amortization are computed for financial reporting purposes
utilizing primarily the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the related assets, which range from 5 to 25 years, or for leasehold
improvements and property under capital lease, the base lease term or estimated
useful life, if shorter. Maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings when
incurred.
STORE PREOPENING COSTS
Store preopening costs, consisting primarily of incremental labor, supplies
and occupancy costs directly related to the opening of specific stores, are
capitalized as prepaid expenses and other current assets and expensed during the
month in which the store is opened. In keeping with the recommendations of
Statement of Position SOP 98-5, Reporting on the Cost of Start-up
Activities we will change this policy in fiscal 1999 and expense these costs as
incurred. Upon adoption, we will expense approximately $12 million of
preopening expenses deferred as of January 31, 1999. This will be reflected in
the consolidated statement of operations as the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle.
INTERNAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Internal software development costs, consisting primarily of incremental
internal labor costs and benefits, are expensed as incurred. Total amounts
charged to operations for fiscal years 1998, 1997 and 1996 were approximately
$16 million, $13 million and $15 million, respectively. In keeping with the
recommendations of SOP 98-1 Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, we will change this policy in fiscal
1999 and begin to capitalize certain internal software development costs and
amortize them over the life of the related software, as provided for in the SOP.
LEASEHOLD INTERESTS
Leasehold interests represent the discounted net present value of the
excess of the fair rental value over the respective contractual rent of
facilities under operating leases acquired in business combinations.
Amortization expense is computed on a straight-line basis over the respective
lease terms. Accumulated amortization totaled $162 million at January 31, 1999
and February 1, 1998, respectively.
STORE CLOSING COSTS
The Company provides an allowance for estimated costs and losses to be
incurred in connection with store closures and losses on the disposal of
store-related assets, which is net of anticipated sublease income. Such costs
are recognized when a store is specifically identified, costs can be estimated
and closure is planned to be completed within the next twelve months. See Note
12.
ADVERTISING
The Company expenses all advertising costs as such costs are incurred.
Amounts due under vendor cooperative advertising agreements are recorded as
receivables until their collection. Advertising expense for
31
33
CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996 totaled approximately $219 million, $237 million
and $218 million, net of vendor funded cooperative advertising, respectively.
ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
Assets held for sale consist of newly acquired land, buildings and store
fixtures owned by the Company which the Company intends in the next twelve
months to sell to and lease back from third parties under lease arrangements.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets on a
quarterly basis to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and an impairment
loss should be recognized.
INCOME TAXES
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future
years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their
financial reporting amounts temporary differences at each year end based on
enacted tax laws and statutory rates applicable to the period in which the
temporary differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation
allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense includes both taxes payable
for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and
liabilities.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, encourages but does not require companies to
record compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation plans at fair
value. The Company has chosen to continue to account for stock-based
compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and
related interpretations thereof. Accordingly, compensation cost for stock
options is measured as the excess, if any, of the market price of the Company
stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the
stock. See Note 9.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. SFAS No. 128 establishes standards for
computing and presenting earnings per share EPS and supercedes Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 15, Earnings per Share APB 15. SFAS No. 128
replaces the presentation of primary EPS with a presentation of basic EPS which
excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common
shareholders by the weighted-average of common shares outstanding during the
period. This statement also requires dual presentation of basic EPS and diluted
EPS on the face of the income statement for all periods presented. Diluted EPS
is calculated similarly to fully diluted EPS pursuant to APB 15, with some
modifications. SFAS No. 128 is effective for financial statements issued for
periods ending after December 15, 1997, including interim periods. The Company
adopted SFAS No. 128 in fiscal 1997 and has restated all prior period EPS data
presented within these financial statements.

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior year financial statement amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the current year presentation.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
During fiscal 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income, which had no effect on the Company financial position
or results of operations.
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 establishes new
standards for the way that public companies report selected information about
operating segments in interim and annual financial statements. It also
establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services,
geographic areas and major customers. The adoption of SFAS No. 131 had no effect
on the financial statements since the Company operates in a single segment.
In February 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132, Employers Disclosures
about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. This statement was adopted
during fiscal 1998 and only required certain disclosures in the Company
financial statements. The adoption did not have any effect on the Company
financial position or results of operations.
In March 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position SOP
98-1, Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use. The SOP defines the characteristics of internal-use computer,
software criteria for capitalization, and financial statement disclosure
requirements. The SOP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1998, with earlier application encouraged. The
33
35
CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Company will adopt SOP 98-1 in the first quarter of fiscal 1999 and does not
expect that such adoption will have a material effect on the Company financial
position or results of operations.
In April 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued SOP 98-5, Reporting on the
Cost of Start-up Activities. The SOP broadly defines start-up activities as
those one-time activities related to opening a new facility, introducing a new
product or service, conducting business in a new territory, or commencing some
new operation. The SOP requires that the costs of start-up activities be
expensed as incurred and is effective for financial statements for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1998, with earlier application encouraged. The
Company current accounting policy with respect to the cost of start-up
activities store preopening expenses is to defer such costs for the
approximately three month period of time that it takes to develop a new store
facility and to expense such costs during the month that the new store opens.
The Company will adopt SOP 98-5 in the first quarter of fiscal 1999, which will
require the Company to change its current accounting policy to expense start-up
costs as incurred. Upon adoption, the Company will expense approximately $12
million, which will be reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
NOTE 2 -- 1996 RECAPITALIZATION
In October 1996, certain affiliates of INVESTCORP S.A. Investcorp and
certain other investors collectively with Investcorp, the Investcorp Group
acquired a 51% common equity interest in the Company for $1050 million in cash
from the Carmel Trust Carmel, which previously had held 100% of the common
equity interests in the Company. A corporation in which an affiliate of
Investcorp held a minority interest also purchased $400 million in aggregate
principal amount of the Company 12% Subordinated Notes for $400 million in
cash, and the Company in turn purchased $400 million of preferred stock of
Auto. Transatlantic Finance, Ltd., an affiliate of Carmel Transatlantic, and
with Carmel, the Carmel Group purchased $100 million in aggregate principal
amount of the Company 12% Subordinated Notes, and the Company in turn
purchased $100 million of preferred stock of Auto. Auto then borrowed $1000
million under the Senior Credit Facility, which together with the net proceeds
from the sale of $1250 million of Auto 11% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006
and the net proceeds from the sale by Auto to the Company of $500 million of
preferred stock, following a dividend to the Company by Auto, was used to redeem
the stock of the Company held by Carmel for $2385 million. Carmel then
purchased from the Company for $1009 million a 49% common equity interest in
the Company. Auto then repaid amounts outstanding under a then existing credit
agreement, which was terminated, and paid $99 million to members of management
pursuant to previously existing equity participation agreements and incurred
additional expenses of $227 million related to the foregoing. The foregoing
transactions are referred to individually and collectively as the 1996
Recapitalization. Following the 1996 Recapitalization, the Investcorp Group
owned a 51% common equity interest in the Company, a corporation in which an
affiliate of Investcorp held a minority interest owned $400 million in
aggregate principal amount of the Company 12% Subordinated Notes, Carmel owned
a 49% common equity interest in the Company, Transatlantic owned $100 million
in aggregate principal amount of the Company 12% Subordinated Notes and the
Company owned 100% of the common equity and $500 million of preferred stock of
Auto.
Prior to the 1996 Recapitalization, the Company had entered into incentive
compensation agreements with certain of its executives pursuant to which they
would be compensated in a sale of the Company equity securities as if they
owned specified percentages of the Company outstanding common stock. Pursuant
to these agreements, three former and four current executive officers received
certain payments in connection with the 1996 Recapitalization based upon the
consideration they would have been entitled to if they had owned an aggregate of
64% of the Company common stock and had sold all of such common stock in
connection with the 1996 Recapitalization at the price per share paid for such
shares in the 1996 Recapitalization. Upon closing of the 1996 Recapitalization,
the Company became obligated to pay
34
36
CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
approximately $199 million under these equity participation agreements. The
Company expensed this full amount plus a provision for estimated payroll taxes
thereon during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996 when the 1996 Recapitalization
was consummated and paid $99 million approximately 50% of the total
obligation with proceeds from the 1996 Recapitalization. The Company paid the
remaining balance in November 1997 and Carmel reimbursed the Company for
approximately 60% the estimated after-tax cost to the Company of the amount of
such final payment. Such reimbursement was recorded as a Stockholder
Receivable and as Additional Paid-in Capital.
In addition, the Company incurred legal, accounting, consulting, bridge
loan commitment and other 1996 Recapitalization fees and expenses of
approximately $125 million.
The sources and uses of cash in the 1996 Recapitalization which transpired
on October 30, 1996 were as follows in thousands:

NOTE 3 -- TRAK WEST ACQUISITION
On December 8, 1997, the Company acquired a newly formed subsidiary Trak
West of Trak Auto Corporation Trak Auto. Upon its formation, Trak Auto
contributed to Trak West the fixtures and equipment, merchandise inventories and
store leases of 82 specific store sites in Southern California, together with
the merchandise inventory of the Ontario, California distribution center
operated by Trak Auto. After this contribution, Trak West had no liabilities and
owned no other assets than those previously described.
The Company acquired Trak West for a total cost of approximately $345
million and financed its acquisition with a $220 million equity investment by
affiliates of the Company existing stockholders and borrowings under the
Senior Credit Facility. In connection therewith, an affiliate of Investcorp was
paid a $10 million placement fee. In connection with the negotiation of the
Trak West acquisition, TG Investments, Ltd., an affiliate of Carmel, was paid a
$10 million consulting fee.
The Trak West acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of these stores are included
in the consolidated operating results of the Company from December 9, 1997, the
first day of operations subsequent to the acquisition, and were not material to
the Company consolidated results of operations for fiscal 1997.

The purchase price was allocated based upon the fair market values of
assets acquired at December 8, 1997 as follows in thousands:
$35,322
Closed store    625
Benefits    193
$34,504
No goodwill was recorded in connection with this acquisition.
The Company incurred $31 million and $34 million of one-time transition
and integration expenses during fiscal 1998 and fiscal 1997, respectively,
associated with the Trak West acquisition. Such expenses included the costs of
employee training, remerchandising and grand opening advertising for the former
Trak West stores.
NOTE 4 -- TRANSACTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH RELATED PARTIES
During fiscal 1996, the Company received approximately $185 million of
proceeds from the sale of realty and fixtures to an affiliate at amounts that
equaled the Company cost, which approximated fair market value. The related
assets were subsequently leased back by the Company under operating lease
arrangements. No such transactions occurred during fiscal 1998 and 1997.
In October 1989, the Company entered into a nine-year lease the Initial
Lease for its corporate headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, with an unaffiliated
landlord. The lease relates to approximately 78,577 square feet and provides for
a current base rent of approximately $149 million per year. During January
1994, Missouri Falls Holdings Corp., an affiliate of Carmel, acquired an
interest in a partnership Missouri Falls Partners which acquired the
building and assumed the lease between the Company and the former landlord. In
April 1995, the Company assumed a lease the Subsequent Lease between a
former tenant and Missouri Falls Partners for approximately 11,683 square feet
of additional office space at a current lease rent of $221,510 per year. In
connection with the 1996 Recapitalization, both the Initial Lease and the
Subsequent Lease were extended through October 2006. Additionally, the Company
rents approximately 5,754 square feet of additional space at these premises for
an annual rental of $106,449 under three separate lease documents with
expiration dates of February and March 2000, respectively. The Company also
leases from MFP Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of Carmel, a parking lot adjacent to
its corporate headquarters for an annual rental of $62,506 under a separate
lease document with an expiration date of October 2006.
The Company paid Transatlantic, in April of 1998, the sum of $10 million
on account of fees for past financings.
In connection with the 1996 Recapitalization, $400 million of the
Company 12% Senior Subordinated Notes were acquired by a designee of the
Investcorp Group, Southwest Finance Limited Southwest Finance, a company in
which an affiliate of Investcorp holds a minority interest. In connection with
the purchase of the 12% Subordinated Notes, Southwest Finance Limited received a
fee of $40 million. In addition, Transatlantic acquired $100 million of the
12% Subordinated Notes. Also, in connection with the 1996 Recapitalization,
Invifin S.A., an affiliate of Investcorp Invifin, received a fee of $1575
million for providing a standby commitment to fund the amount of the Senior
Credit Facility and the Company paid Investcorp International Inc.
International advisory fees of $1275 million. The Company also paid $315
million to International for arranging the Senior Credit Facility.
In addition, in connection with the 1996 Recapitalization, the Company
entered into a five-year agreement for management advisory and consulting
services the Management Agreement with International pursuant to which the
Company paid International at the closing of the 1996 Recapitalization
36
38
CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
$50 million for the entire term of the Management Agreement in accordance with
its terms. The Management Agreement was terminated in connection with the
completion of an initial public offering of the common stock of the Company, as
more fully described in Note 8. In connection with the termination of the
agreement, the Company recognized a charge to earnings of approximately $36
million during the first quarter of fiscal 1998, which represented the
unamortized balance of the prepaid advisory fees.

On December 8, 1997, in connection with the consummation of the Trak West
acquisition, Auto amended and restated its Senior Credit Facility to provide
maximum borrowings of $3000 million, subject to the limitations on the
incurrence of indebtedness under the indenture for Auto 11% Senior
Subordinated Notes. As amended and restated, the Senior Credit Facility provides
for a $1750 million term loan and a revolving credit facility with maximum
borrowings of $1250 million. In addition to increasing the term loan
37
39
CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
and revolving credit facility availability by $755 million and $250 million,
respectively, the amendment and restatement primarily provided for: i an
initial reduction in the interest rate for the term loan and the revolving
credit facility and the introduction of a pricing grid which periodically
permits adjustment based upon Auto degree of leverage; ii the elimination of
the previous borrowing base restrictions on revolving credit borrowings; iii
capital expenditure baskets for the Trak West acquisition and for up to $500
million of other acquisitions subject to pro forma compliance with financial
covenants; and iv a $500 million revolving capital expenditure basket of
funds that can be used by Auto to finance store purchase and development
activities. The term loan portion of the Senior Credit Facility matures on
October 31, 2003 and the revolving credit portion matures on October 31, 2001.
The Company recognized an extraordinary charge of $51 million $30
million net of income taxes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997 to reflect the
write-off of certain deferred financing costs associated with the early
extinguishment of the original Senior Credit Facility.
Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility are collateralized by a first
priority security interest in substantially all of the personal property of
Auto, subject to certain permitted liens. The Company also issued a guarantee of
such borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility, which guarantee is
collateralized by a pledge by the Company of all issued and outstanding capital
stock of Auto. In addition, the revolving credit portion allows for the issuance
of letters of credit that reduce revolver availability. At January 31, 1999 06 million in letter of credits were outstanding. There were no letters of
credit outstanding as of February 1, 1998.
The Senior Credit Facility prohibits, with certain limited exceptions, the
optional or mandatory prepayment or other defeasance of Auto 11% Senior
Subordinated Notes. The Senior Credit Facility further requires that, under
certain circumstances, Auto make prepayments of the term loan outstanding
thereunder with i 50% of any Excess Cash Flow as defined therein and ii
50% of the Net Proceeds as defined therein from certain offerings of the
Company voting stock. In addition, a change of control allows the lenders to
accelerate the loans. A change of control occurs whenever anyone acquires the
power to vote at least 30% of the common stock, on a fully diluted basis as
defined, and holds a greater percentage of shares of common stock than the
Investcorp Group. A change of control also occurs if a majority of the Board of
Directors ceases to be composed of Investcorp Group nominees.
Commitment fees on available funds under the Revolving Credit Commitment
are payable quarterly in arrears on the average daily-unused amount of the total
commitment at the rate of 3/8 of 1% per annum. Commitment fees totaling $295,000
and $194,000 were incurred in fiscal 1998 and 1997, respectively.
The terms of the Senior Credit Facility include restrictions on
investments, capital expenditures, dividends and certain other payments and
require the Company to meet certain financial covenants. The Company believes it
was in compliance with all such covenants at January 31, 1999.
11% SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE 2006
On October 30, 1996, Auto issued and sold in a private placement $1250
million aggregate principal amount of 11% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006
the Old 11% Notes pursuant to an indenture, between Auto and The Bank of New
York as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee. On March 13, 1997,
Auto offered to exchange up to all outstanding Old 11% Notes for a like
principal amount of its 11% Series A Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006 the
11% Senior Subordinated Notes issued pursuant to the Indenture in a
transaction registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Auto
consummated the exchange offer on June 18, 1997, with all of the Old 11% Notes
being exchanged for the 11% Senior Subordinated Notes.
The indenture potentially restricts Auto from making additional borrowings
under its Revolving Credit Commitment that, when added to the aggregate amount
of outstanding borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility including term
loans, exceed $2000 million. This restriction does not apply if the new
borrowings
38
40
CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
are of a type specifically permitted by the indenture, or, if after giving pro
forma effect to such new borrowings the ratio of Auto consolidated EBITDA to
fixed charges as such terms are defined in the indenture exceeds 225 to 1.
Accordingly, the Company has been able to exceed the potential restriction and
does not anticipate that it will limit access to further borrowings under the
Senior Credit Facility.
The indenture also provides that upon a change of control, as defined
therein, each holder of 11% Senior Subordinated Notes will have the right to
require Auto to repurchase all or any part of such holder notes at a purchase
price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date of purchase.
The 11% Senior Subordinated Notes bear interest at 11% per year, payable
semiannually in arrears on each May 1 and November 1, and mature on November 1,
2006. The 11% Senior Subordinated Notes are general, unsecured senior
subordinated obligations. The 11% Senior Subordinated Notes were guaranteed
fully, unconditionally and jointly and severally by all of Auto subsidiaries
and will be similarly guaranteed by any future United States subsidiaries of
Auto, on a senior subordinated basis. On April 8, 1998, Auto subsidiaries were
merged into Auto.
On and after November 1, 2001, the 11% Senior Subordinated Notes will be
redeemable, at the option of Auto, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30
nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices set forth below
expressed in percentages of principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, if any, to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the
12-month period beginning on November 1 of the years indicated below:

Note 8.
12% SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE 2008
On October 30, 1996, the Company issued and sold in a private placement

2008 the Series A Notes pursuant to an Indenture between the Company and
Transatlantic Finance, Ltd., as Trustee, and $400 million aggregate principal
amount of 12% Subordinated Series B Notes due 2008 the Series B Notes, and
together with the Series A Notes, the 12% Subordinated Notes pursuant to an
Indenture between the Company and AIBC, N.V., as Trustee. The terms of the

in full, with proceeds of the Company March 1998 initial public offering of
common stock.

the redemption of indebtedness and the write-off of a portion of deferred debt
issuance costs.
NOTE 7 -- LEASES
The Company leases its office and warehouse facilities, all but six of its
retail stores, and a majority of its equipment. Generally, store leases provide
for minimum rentals and the payment of utilities, maintenance, insurance and
taxes. Certain store leases also provide for contingent rentals based upon a
percentage of sales in excess of a stipulated minimum. The majority of lease
agreements are for base lease periods ranging from 15 to 20 years, with three to
five renewal options of five years each.
On November 18, 1997, the Company reached an agreement with an unrelated
third party for the establishment of a $1250 million operating lease facility
for the acquisition and development of approximately 100 to 125 new stores over
the period from February 1, 1998 through May 31, 1999. As of January 31, 1999,
approximately $358 million of this $1250 million leasing facility had been
committed.

Class A, Class C, Class D and Class F capital stock. All of the Class F stock
consisting of 100 shares was then redeemed at an aggregate redemption price of
approximately $2385 million. Concurrently therewith, the Company issued
8,381,450 shares of Class E stock to Carmel at an issue price of $1009 million.
See Note 2.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
On March 17, 1998, the Company completed an initial public offering the
IPO of approximately 86 million shares of its common stock, generating
proceeds of approximately $1591 million, net of offering expenses. The offering
proceeds were used to retire the Company 12% Subordinated Notes and other
indebtedness as more fully described in Note 6. Upon retirement of the 12%
Subordinated Notes, all of the outstanding preferred stock of Auto was
cancelled.
In connection with the IPO, the Company Board of Directors and
stockholders approved a 17105 to 1 stock split effected in the form of a stock
dividend. Accordingly, all share and option information contained herein has
been adjusted to give retroactive effect to such stock split. In addition, under
the terms of the Company restated Certificate of Incorporation in effect at
the time of the IPO, each share of each class of issued and outstanding capital
stock of the Company automatically converted to common stock upon the
consummation of the IPO on March 17, 1998.
The Company capital stock, as adjusted for the stock split discussed
above, consists of the following:

NOTE 9 -- EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company provides various health, welfare and disability benefits to its
full-time employees which are funded primarily by Company contributions. The
Company does not provide post-employment or post-retirement health care or life
insurance benefits to its employees.
RETIREMENT PROGRAM
The Company sponsors a 401k plan which is available to all employees of
the Company who have completed one year of continuous service. Effective October
1, 1997, the Company matches from 40% to 60% of employee contributions in 10%
increments, based on years of service with the Company, up to 4% of the
participant base salary. Prior to October 1, 1997, the Company matched 20% of
employee contributions, up to 6% of the participant base salary, without
regard to years of service. Participant contributions are subject to certain
restrictions as set forth in the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matching
contributions totaled $1,258,500, $394,500 and $288,000 for fiscal years 1998,
1997 and 1996, respectively.
1996 STOCK OPTION PLANS
On October 30, 1996, the Company awarded options to purchase shares of
common stock under its Associate Stock Option Plan the Associate Plan and
its Executive Stock Option Plan the Executive Plan and together with the
Associate Plan, the Plans in order to provide incentives to store managers
and
42
44
CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
salaried corporate and warehouse employees of the Company. In October 1996 and
February 1997, the Company Board of Directors approved the Associate Plan and
the Executive Plan, respectively.
The Plans may be administered by a committee of the Board of Directors of
the Company, which would have broad authority in administering and interpreting
the Plans, or, if a committee has not been appointed, by the entire Board of
Directors. The Plans provide that, at such time as the Company has a class of
equity securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended the Exchange Act, the committee if appointed must consist
entirely of Non-Employee Directors as defined in Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act. A committee has not yet been appointed to administer the Plans.
Options to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,026,300 and 684,200 shares of
common stock may be granted under the Associate Plan and the Executive Plan,
respectively. Options granted under the Plans may be options intended to qualify
as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, or options not intended to so qualify. In the event of a sale
of more than 80% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or
80% of its assets, as defined, all options under the plan are vested. All
options expire on the seventh anniversary of the date of grant or, under
certain circumstances, 30 days later.
As a result of the IPO, each option granted under the Plans will become
exercisable upon vesting. Options granted under the Associate Plan vest in three
equal installments on the second, third and fourth anniversaries of the date of
their grant, assuming the associate employment continues during this period
Four Year Vesting. Options granted under the Executive Plan are subject to
the Four Year Vesting as to 84% of such options and performance vesting over
the same four years as to the remaining 16%. The performance vesting criteria
is based upon achieving specified operating results. Partial vesting of options
subject to performance vesting occurs if the Company achieves less than 95% of
the specified operating results. Any portion of options granted under the
Executive Plan which are subject to performance vesting and which do not vest
during the four years will automatically vest 90 days prior to the end of the
option term. If the specified operating results are exceeded for any year by
at least 10%, the executive will receive options for up to an additional 5% 20%
on a cumulative basis of his or her original option grant. Based on 1998
results, an additional 8,713 options will be granted in April 1999.
As of January 31, 1999, the Company has granted options to purchase 796,416
shares under the Associate Plan and 390,908 shares under the Executive Plan, net
of cancellations and exercises. Except for 96,062 options granted under the
Executive Plan see Employment Agreements below, the exercise prices
represent the fair market value at the date of grant based upon the price paid
for such shares in the 1996 Recapitalization and other valuation analyses
performed by the Company, or actual market prices as determined by trades
reported by the New York Stock Exchange subsequent to the IPO, as applicable.
DIRECTORS STOCK PLAN
Directors who are currently associated with the Investcorp Group or the
Carmel Group do not currently receive any compensation for serving as directors.
In June 1998, the Company Board of Directors adopted a non-employee director
compensation plan, subject to shareholder approval. The plan provides for an
aggregate of up to 50,000 shares in the form of restricted stock grants or stock
options. The Board of Directors has adopted a policy which provides each
non-employee director with an annual stipend of $25,000, of which at least
$10,000 must be paid in the form of restricted stock grants.
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS
Auto has entered into employment agreements with the Chairman and the
President pursuant to which they are paid fixed base salaries and are eligible
for bonuses based upon earnings per share. The agreements do not contain stated
termination dates, but rather are terminable at will by either party. If Auto
were to
43
45
CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
terminate the employment of the Chairman and President without cause, or if they
terminate their employment for good reason, Auto has agreed to pay to the
Chairman his base salary and performance bonus for a period of 24 months and to
the President his base salary for one year. The Chairman also received a loan of
$550,000 from the Company, bearing interest at 4535% and due in 1999.
In connection with the commencement of his employment, the Company agreed
to pay the Chairman $10 million which, in turn, was used by the Chairman to
purchase 83,079 shares of common stock from a member of the Investcorp Group,
reflecting a share value of $1204, the fair market value at the date of the
agreement, based on the price paid for such shares in the 1996 Recapitalization.
The Company also loaned the Chairman approximately $440,000 to pay the income
tax consequences of the award. The loan bears interest at the rate applicable to
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Commitment. This loan was paid in full in
December 1998.
In connection with the execution of his employment agreement, the Company
Chairman received an option for 401,967 shares of common stock, exercisable at
$1204 per share. As of January 31, 1999, this option vested to the extent of
100,491 shares. As a result of vesting acceleration triggered by the IPO, this
option will generally vest and become exercisable in March 2000, subject to
earlier vesting based upon the achievement of certain EBITDA targets and the
occurrence of other specified events. In connection with the Trak West
acquisition, the Company Chairman received an option for 39,940 shares of
common stock, exercisable at $1204 per share, effective as of February 1, 1998.
This option will vest and become exercisable in four equal annual installments
beginning in April 1999. In connection with the issuance of these options, the
Company will recognize a charge to earnings of approximately $02 million over
the vesting period for the difference between the exercise price and the fair
market value of the common stock at the date of grant. In connection with the
IPO, the Company Chairman received an option for 216,634 shares of common
stock, exercisable at $2000 per share, the fair market value at the date of
grant based on the IPO. This option will vest and become exercisable in three
equal annual installments beginning in April 2000.
In connection with the execution of his employment agreement, the Company
President received an option for 299,337 shares of common stock, exercisable at
$1204 per share. This option has both vested and become exercisable to the
extent of 106,905 shares. As a result of vesting acceleration triggered by the
IPO, the remainder of this option will generally vest and become exercisable in
March 2000, subject to earlier vesting based upon the achievement of certain
EBITDA targets and the occurrence of other specified events.
MANAGEMENT STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND LOANS PLANS
In December 1997, the Company entered into stock purchase agreements with
certain executives of the Company. Under the terms of the agreements, the
Company agreed to issue a total of 180,600 shares of its common stock at a price
of $1204 per share, the same price paid in the 1996 Recapitalization. In
addition, the Company granted certain executives non-qualified options to
purchase 96,058 shares of its common stock, also at a price of $1204 per share.
The options contain similar terms and vesting provisions as existing options
under the Company Executive Stock Option Plan. In connection with the issuance
of these shares, the Company recognized a charge to earnings of $09 million in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997 for the difference between the issuance price
and the fair market value of the stock at the date of sale. In addition, in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company recorded deferred compensation of
approximately $05 million to reflect the difference between the exercise price
and the fair market value of stock associated with the options granted to
certain executives. The deferred compensation will produce a charge to earnings
over the vesting period of the options.
Of the total consideration paid to the Company of $22 million in
connection with the purchase of the Company common stock by certain
executives, approximately $10 million was loaned by the Company to certain
executives to purchase 84,542 of the shares the Stock Loans. The Stock Loans
are collateralized

The Company has recorded deferred tax assets of approximately $55 million
as of January 31, 1999 reflecting the benefit of tax loss carryforwards totaling
$137 million which expire in 2013. Realization is dependent on generating
sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards.
Utilization of certain of the net operating loss carryforwards may be limited
under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Although realization is not
assured, management believes it is more likely than not that all the deferred
tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, the Company believes that no valuation
allowance is required for deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax
liabilities. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable,
however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income
during the carryforward period are reduced.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
In January 1997, the Company updated its strategic plan relating to the
closing of certain stores. As a result of the 1996 Recapitalization, the Company
obtained greater access to capital resources including the availability of a
sale-leaseback facility for new stores, thereby improving the Company ability
to implement such store closings. While management believes that there will be
long-term operating benefits from this strategy, the Company will incur costs
for early lease terminations or negative sub-lease rentals for stores vacated
under this plan and, accordingly, a charge to earnings of approximately $129
million was recorded in January 1997.
Store closing costs include estimates for vacancy periods of the related
stores through the expiration of the underlying leases, collectibility of rents
due from sub-tenants, and similar factors.
NOTE 13 -- LEGAL MATTERS
The Company was served with a lawsuit that was filed in the Superior Court
in San Diego, California on May 4, 1998. The case is brought by two former store
managers and a former assistant manager. It purports to be a class action for
all present and former California store managers and senior assistant managers
and seeks overtime pay for a period beginning in May 1995 as well as injunctive
relief requiring overtime pay in the future. This case is in the early stages of
discovery. The Company was recently served with two other lawsuits purporting to
be class actions filed in California state courts in Orange and Fresno Counties
by thirteen other former and current employees. These lawsuits include similar
claims to the San Diego lawsuit, except that they also include claims for unfair
business practices which seek overtime from October 1994. The Orange County
lawsuit initially included a claim for punitive damages based on an unlawful
conversion theory. On March 9, 1999, the Orange County court dismissed the
conversion theory and claim for punitive damages but gave the plaintiff 30 days
to refile an amended claim. These plaintiffs have since filed an amended
complaint which also includes a claim for conversion and asks for punitive
damages. The Company has again requested the court to eliminate these items from
the case. The three cases have recently been coordinated before one judge in
San Diego County who will be selected shortly. If these cases are permitted by
the courts to proceed as a class action and are decided against the Company, the
aggregate potential exposure could be material to results of operations for the
year in which the cases are ultimately decided. The Company does not believe,
however, that such an adverse outcome, if it were to happen, would materially
affect the Company financial position or operations in subsequent periods.
Although at this early stage in the litigation it is difficult to predict its
outcome with any certainty, the Company believes that there are meritorious
defenses to all of these cases and intends to defend them vigorously.
The Company currently and from time to time is involved in other litigation
incidental to the conduct of business. The damages claimed in some of these
litigations are substantial. Although the amount of liability that may result
from these matters cannot be ascertained, the Company does not currently believe
that, in the aggregate, they will result in liabilities material to consolidated
financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
