Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Renaissance Learning, Inc. and Subsidiaries   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Renaissance Learning, Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and
the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2007. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at a2. We also have audited the
Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2007, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Companys management is responsible for
these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule and an
opinion on the Companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
companys principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
by the companys board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.   As described in Note5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, on January1, 2006, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No123R,
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. As described in
Note8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on
January1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation
No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Renaissance Learning, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December31, 2007, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2007, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.   /s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP

Significant
accounting policies   
a
Use of
estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.   
b
Revenue
recognition   We recognize revenue from our software products in accordance
with Statement of Position
No97-2
Software Revenue Recognition
SOP97-2
issued by the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Revenues are
recorded net of an allowance for estimated returns. Allowances
for bad debts are also recorded at the time of the sale.   Product revenue is derived primarily from the sale of
educational software and hardware. Revenue from sales of
hardware is generally recognized when the product is shipped to
the customer. Revenue recognition from sales of our software
depends on whether the software is:
ioff-the-shelf
or customized and iiwhether it is licensed on a
perpetual basis or as a subscription. We recognize revenue from
off-the-shelf
perpetually licensed software sales upon shipment to customers.
Subscription-based software sales are recognized as revenue on a
straight-line basis over the subscription period. Sales of
software that require substantial modification or customization
are recognized as revenue using the
percentage-of-completion
method of accounting. Revenues and deferred revenues from
software that require substantial modification or customization
are not significant in any of the years presented.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Service revenue is derived from iproduct support
services, iiprofessional development and product
training seminars and conferences, iiiapplication
hosting, ivtechnical services, vconsulting and
viother remote services. Product support services
included with sales of perpetually licensed software have a
duration of 12months or less and the associated revenue is
recognized at the time the software is shipped with the related
costs of providing the telephone support accrued for at the same
time. Revenue from professional development and product training
seminars and conferences is recognized when the seminar or
conference is held. Revenue from other product support services
and application hosting is initially recorded as deferred
revenue and then recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis
over the term of the agreement, typically 12months.
Revenue from technical services, consulting and other remote
services is recognized as the services are performed or on a
straight-line basis over the contractual period.   Deferred revenue includes iamounts invoiced for products
not yet delivered and services not yet performed,
iiadvance invoicing on contracts and iiithat
portion of support agreements and subscription-based product
sales that has not yet been recognized as revenue.   
c
Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.   We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of
long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully
recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and
other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives annually,
or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an
asset may be impaired. Management uses its judgment when
applying impairment rules to determine when an impairment test
is necessary. Examples of factors which could trigger an
impairment review include: ia significant decrease in
the market value of an asset, iia significant change in
the extent or manner in which an asset is used and
iiisignificant adverse changes in legal factors or the
business climate that impact the value of an asset.   Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the
carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value.
Estimating fair value requires that we forecast future cash
flows related to the asset subject to review. These forecasts
require assumptions about demand for our products and services,
future market conditions and technological developments. Other
assumptions include determining the discount rate and future
growth rates. Changes to these assumptions could result in an
impairment charge in future periods.

Investment
securities   We classify our investment securities as
held-to-maturity,

accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities SFAS115.   Debt securities have an original maturity of more than three
months and a remaining maturity of less than 24months. Our
investments in debt securities consist of auction rate
securities and municipal bonds. Municipal bonds are classified
as
held-to-maturity
and are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of our debt
securities listed below is based on quoted market prices.   Auction rate securities are classified as available for sale.
Auction rate securities are liquid investments with interest

that occurs every 7 to 49days, depending on the terms of
the individual security. The underlying securities have
long-term maturities. Our auction rate securities are stated

Software
development costs   We capitalize certain software development costs incurred after
technological feasibility is achieved. Capitalized costs are
reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value.
Capitalized software development costs are amortized on a
product-by-product
basis using the straight-line method over the estimated economic
life of the products, which is generally estimated to be
24months. Amortization begins when the products are
available for general release to customers. All other research
and development expenditures are charged to product development
expense in the period incurred. When capitalized software is
fully amortized, the balance is removed from the capitalized
software and accumulated amortization accounts. Amounts
capitalized were approximately $02million,
$07million and $03million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. Amortization expense of approximately
$05million, $04million and $05million for
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, is included in cost of
sales-products in the consolidated statements of income. At
December31, 2007 and 2006, accumulated amortization of
capitalized software development costs was $04million and

Sales and
concentration of credit risks   We grant credit to our customers in the ordinary course of
business. The majority of our customers are schools or school
districts, although we do sell some of our products through
resellers. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade
receivables are limited due to the significant number of
customers and their geographic dispersion. In 2007, 2006, and
2005, no single customer represented more than 10% of net sales.

Share-based
compensation   Effective January1, 2006, we adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No123R Share-Based
Payments SFAS123R, using the modified
prospective application transition method. The modified
prospective application transition method requires compensation
cost to be recognized beginning on the effective date
abased on the requirements of SFAS123R for all
share-based payments granted after the effective date and
bbased on the requirements of SFAS123R for all
awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of
SFAS123R that remain unvested on the effective date. As
such, prior periods will not reflect restated amounts.   Prior to January1, 2006, we elected to follow the
intrinsic value based method of accounting for stock options
consistent with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB
25 and to provide the pro forma disclosures of net income
and earnings per share as if the fair value based method had
been applied. Under the intrinsic value method, compensation
cost for stock options is measured by the excess, if any, of the
quoted price of our stock at the measurement date over the
exercise price.   No stock-based employee compensation expense related to stock
options or our stock purchase plans was reflected in net income
prior to January1, 2006. SFAS123R requires us to

shares or restricted stock units are granted to certain
employees and our directors. For employees, restricted stock
awards generally vest over a period of four years and for
non-employee directors, upon termination of the
individuals tenure on our board. Restricted stock awards
to employees are expensed over the vesting period and those made
to our non-employee directors are expensed when granted.   During the year ended December31, 2007, we recognized
approximately $11million in share-based compensation
expense related primarily to restricted stock and to a lesser
extent, stock options as compared to $07million in 2006.
Cash received from stock option exercises was approximately
$17,000 in 2007 and $16,000 in 2006. The total income tax
benefit recognized related to share-based compensation, which is
recorded in additional paid-in capital, was approximately
$10,000 and $393,000 for the years ended December31, 2007
and 2006, respectively.   The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was used to compute the
fair value of each option granted for purposes of the pro forma
disclosures required by SFAS123R. Had compensation cost in
2005 been determined for the stock option grants based on the

approximately 438,000shares of our common stock becoming
immediately exercisable. All of the unvested stock options for
which vesting was accelerated were underwater, with
exercise prices greater than the closing price of our common
stock on the date of acceleration. Vesting of the options was
accelerated as part of our plan to transition the equity-based
portion of our executive compensation plan from stock options to
grants of restricted stock, which we believe will be a more
effective performance incentive and retention tool. Also,

Earnings
per common share   Earnings per share is computed in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No128 Earnings per
Share SFAS128. Basic earnings per common
share Basic EPS is computed by dividing income
available to common shareholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Shares issued
and shares reacquired during the period are weighted for the
portion of the period they were outstanding.   Diluted earnings per common share Diluted EPS is
computed similarly to Basic EPS except that the weighted average
number of shares outstanding is increased to include the number
of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if
the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued. Our
potentially dilutive common shares consist of unexercised stock
options and restricted shares.   The computation of Diluted EPS does not assume conversion,
exercise or contingent issuance of securities that may have an
antidilutive effect on earnings per share. Consequently, stock
options with an exercise price greater than the average market
price for the period are not included in the computation of
potentially dilutive common shares. For the years ended
December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, there were approximately
833,000, 829,000 and 895,000, respectively, antidilutive options
excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.   The weighted average shares outstanding are as follows

product failures if any. The specific hardware warranty terms
and conditions vary depending upon the product sold, but
generally include technical support, parts, and labor over a

interpretation provides specific guidance on how enterprises
recognize and measure tax benefits associated with uncertain tax
positions. As a result of the adoption of FIN48, we
recognized a $03million increase in the liability for
unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as a
reduction to the January1, 2007 balance of retained
earnings. We classify interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. During the year

$03million of tax expense related to interest and
penalties.   A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
unrecognized tax benefits is as follows

Segment
reporting   Statement of Financial Accounting Statement No131
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information SFAS131 establishes annual
and interim reporting standards for an enterprises
business segments and related disclosures about its products,
services, geographic areas and major customers. The method of
determining what information to report is based on the way
management organizes the operating segments within the Company
for making operating decisions and assessing financial
performance. In addition, SFAS131 applies both qualitative
and quantitative aggregation rules to operating segments in
order to determine the final reportable segments. Under
SFAS131, we have one reportable segment. Foreign market
operations are not significant at this time.

statement data for each quarter of the last two fiscal years.
This unaudited quarterly financial information is prepared on
the same basis as the annual information presented in the

Recent
accounting pronouncements   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo141R
Business Combinations SFAS141R.
SFAS141R establishes principles and requirements for how
an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements
the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any
noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill
acquired. SFAS141R also establishes disclosure
requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and
financial effects of the business combination. SFAS141R is
effective for us on January1, 2009. SFAS141R is not
expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial
statements.   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo160
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements, an amendment of ARB No51
SFAS160. SFAS160 will change the
accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be
recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a
component of equity. This new consolidation method will
significantly change the accounting for transactions with
minority interest holders. SFAS160 is effective for us on
January1, 2009. SFAS160 is not expected to have a
material effect on our consolidated financial statements.   In February 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo159 The
Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement
No115 SFAS159. This standard
permits entities to measure many financial instruments and
certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve
financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity
to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring
related assets and liabilities differently without having to
apply complex hedge accounting provisions. The provisions of
SFAS159 are effective for us on January1, 2008 and
are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated
financial statements.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo157
Fair Value Measurements SFAS157, to
establish a consistent framework for measuring fair value and
expand disclosures on fair value measurements. The provisions of
SFAS157 are effective for us on January1, 2008 and
are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated
financial statements.   47 Table of Contents   RENAISSANCE

may repurchase an additional 12million shares as of that
date.

amended the Exchange Act. Based on this
evaluation, management, including our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of December31,
2007.   There has been no change in our internal control over financial
reporting that has occurred during the quarter ended
December31, 2007 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.   Managements

adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined under
