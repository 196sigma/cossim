46 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders Onyx Software Corporation We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A, that
Onyx Software Corporation maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Onyx Software
Corporations management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Onyx Software
Corporation and subsidiaries maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004,
is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, Onyx
Software Corporation maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of Onyx Software Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the
related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders equity and comprehensive loss, and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2004 and our report dated March23, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements. s/KPMG LLP Seattle, Washington March23, 2005 47 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders Onyx Software Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Onyx Software Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders equity and
comprehensive loss, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2004. In connection
with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we
have also audited the related financial statement schedule as
listed in the index at . These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Onyx Software Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2004, in conformity
with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. Also in
our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of Onyx Software Corporations internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004,
based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report
dated March23, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of, and the effective operation of,
internal control over financial reporting. s/ KPMG LLP Seattle, Washington March23, 2005 48 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS

Description of the Company and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies   
Description of the Company Onyx Software Corporationthe Company or Onyx is a leading
provider of enterprise solutions that combine customer
management, process management and performance management
technologies to help organizations more effectively acquire,
service, manage and maintain customer and partner relationships.
The Company focuses on its customers success as a prime
criterion for how the Company judges its own success. The
Company markets its solutions to enterprises that want to
integrate their business processes and functions with the help
of software in order to increase their market share, enhance
customer service and improve profitability. The Company
considers its solutions to be leading edge in terms of software
design and architecture. As a result, enterprises using the
Companys solutions can take advantage of lower costs, a
high degree of adaptability and flexibility, and a faster
deployment than what the Company believes is available from
other suppliers in the industry. The Companys solutions
use a single data model across all customer interactions,
allowing for a single repository for all marketing, sales,
service and customer information. The Companys solutions
are fully integrated across all customer-facing departments and
interaction media. The Company believes that its solutions are
designed to be easy to use, widely accessible, rapidly
deployable, scalable, flexible, customizable and reliable, which
can result in a comparatively low total cost of ownership and
rapid return on investment. The Companys integrated product family allows enterprises
to automate the customer lifecycle, along with the associated
business processes, across the entire enterprise. The Company
targets organizations in the services sector, including
enterprises with revenue above $1billion and government
organizations. The Company offers specialized solutions directly
to the market and with partners for industries such as financial
services, insurance and government. The Company markets its
software and services through a direct sales force as well as
through value-added resellers, or VARs, systems integrators and
original equipment manufacturer partners. Some of these partners
integrate Onyx functionality into solutions designed for
specific vertical industries. The Company believes that its
Internet-based solutions can be easily implemented and flexibly
configured to address an enterprises specific business
needs and unique processes. The Company believes its solutions
provide broad functionality that enables the Companys
customers to compete more effectively in todays intensely
competitive and dynamic business environment.   
Reverse Stock Split On July23, 2003, the Companys shareholders approved
a one-for-four reverse stock split which became effective on
that date. All share and per share amounts in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect
this reverse stock split.   
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect amounts reported in the financial statements.
Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material
impact on the financial statements. The Company has used
estimates in determining certain provisions, including
uncollectible trade accounts receivable, useful lives for
property and equipment, useful lives for intangibles, tax
liabilities and restructuring liabilities. The Company has also
used estimates in assessing impairment of goodwill and equity
investments. 53 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with accounting
standards for software companies, including Statement of
Position SOP97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, as amended by SOP98-9, and related
interpretations, including Technical Practice Aids. The Company generates revenue through two sources:
asoftware license revenue and bsupport and
service revenue. Software license revenue is generated from
licensing the rights to use the Companys products directly
to end users and indirectly through VARs and, to a lesser
extent, through third-party products the Company distributes.
Support and service revenue is generated from sales of customer
support services, consulting services and training services
performed for customers that license the Companys products. License revenue is recognized when a noncancelable license
agreement becomes effective as evidenced by a signed contract,
the product has been shipped, the license fee is fixed or
determinable, and collectibility is probable. In software arrangements that include rights to multiple
software products and/or services, the Company allocates the
total arrangement fee among each of the deliverables using the
residual method, under which revenue is allocated to undelivered
elements based on vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
value of such undelivered elements and the residual amounts of
revenue are allocated to delivered elements. Elements included
in multiple element arrangements could consist of software
products, maintenance which includes customer support services
and unspecified upgrades, or consulting services.
Vendor-specific objective evidence is based on the price charged
when an element is sold separately or, in the case of an element
not yet sold separately, the price established by authorized
management, if it is probable that the price, once established,
will not change once the element is sold separately. Standard terms for license agreements call for payment within
90days. Probability of collection is based on the
assessment of the customers financial condition through
the review of its current financial statements or credit
reports. For follow-on sales to existing customers, prior
payment history is also used to evaluate probability of
collection. Revenue from distribution agreements with VARs is
typically recognized on the earlier of receipt of cash from the
VAR or identification of an end user. In the latter case,
probability of collection is evaluated based upon the credit
worthiness of the VAR. The Companys agreements with its
customers and VARs do not contain product return rights. Revenue from maintenance arrangements is recognized ratably over
the term of the contract, typically one year. Consulting revenue
is primarily related to implementation services performed on a
time-and-materials basis, or in certain situations on a
fixed-fee basis, under separate service arrangements.
Implementation services are periodically performed under
fixed-fee arrangements and, in such cases, consulting revenue is
recognized as services are performed. Revenue from consulting
and training services is recognized as services are performed.
Standard terms for renewal of maintenance arrangements,
consulting services and training services call for payment
within 30days. Revenue for certain long-term contracts is recognized in
accordance with SOP81-1, Accounting for Performance
of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts
and is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method. Revenue consisting of fees from licenses sold together with
consulting services are generally recognized upon shipment of
the software, provided that the above criteria are met, payment
of the license fees do not depend on the performance of the
services, and the consulting services are not essential to the
functionality of the licensed software. If the services are
essential to the functionality of the software, or payment of
the license fees depends on the performance of the services,
both the software license and consulting fees are recognized
under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting. 54 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
If the fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is recognized
as payments become due from the customer. If a nonstandard
acceptance period is provided, revenue is recognized upon the
earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the
acceptance period.   
Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a
remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of
purchase to be cash equivalents. At December31, 2003 and
2004, the Companys cash equivalents consisted of money
market funds. Separately, the Company had $17million and $0 in
restricted cash at December31, 2003 and 2004,
respectively, which was security for its credit line with
Silicon Valley Bank SVBand supports its outstanding
letters of credit.   
Fair Values of Financial Instruments At December31, 2004, the Company had the following
financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, cost method equity instruments, purchased technology
obligation, term loan, accounts payable, salaries and benefits
payable and accrued liabilities. The carrying value of cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivable, term loan, accounts
payable, salaries and benefits payable, and accrued liabilities
approximates their fair value based on the liquidity of these
financial instruments or based on their short-term nature. Refer
to the disclosure regarding Investment Losses and Impairment
in Note1 for details of how cost method equity
investments are valued. The Company believes that the present
value of the fair value for the purchased technology obligation,
approximates the fair value at December31, 2004.   
Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is
provided using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the related assets or over the lease term if it
is shorter for leasehold improvements. Estimated useful lives
for computer, purchased software, and office equipment
are3, 4 and 7years, respectively.   
Intangible Assets and Goodwill The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASBissued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFASNo141, Business Combinations, and
SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, in July 2001. SFASNo141 requires that
all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase
method, thereby prohibiting the pooling-of-interests method.
SFASNo141 also specifies criteria for recognizing
and reporting intangible assets apart from goodwill; however,
assembled workforce must be recognized and reported in goodwill.
SFASNo142 requires the use of a non-amortization
approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain
intangibles. Under a non-amortization approach, goodwill and
certain intangibles are no longer amortized into results of
operations, but instead are reviewed for impairment and written
down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in
which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is
more than their fair value. The Company adopted the provisions of SFASNo142 as
of January1, 2002. The Company reclassified an assembled
workforce intangible asset with an unamortized balance of
$12million along with a deferred tax liability of
$387,000 to goodwill on January1, 2002. Goodwill and
intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination
and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not
amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually
in accordance with the provisions of SFASNo142.
SFASNo142 also requires that intangible assets with
estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective
estimated useful lives to 55 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in
accordance with SFASNo144, Accounting for
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. In connection with SFASNo142s transitional
goodwill impairment evaluation, the statement required the
Company to perform an assessment of whether there was an
indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption.
To accomplish this, the Company was required to identify its
reporting units and determine the carrying value of each
reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities,
including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those
reporting units as of January1, 2002. The Company was
required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and
compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit. To the
extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair
value of the reporting unit, the Company would be required to
perform the second step of the transitional impairment test, as
this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be
impaired. The second step, which requires a comparison of the
implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the
carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill, was not required
because the carrying amount of goodwill did not exceed the fair
value of the reporting unit. In the fourth quarters of 2002,
2003 and 2004, the Company performed a similar test to that
described above, in connection with its annual impairment test
required under SFASNo142 and, again, the implied
fair value of the reporting units exceeded their respective
carrying amounts and the Company was not required to recognize
any impairment loss. Prior to the adoption of SFASNo142, goodwill was
amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected periods to
be benefited, generally three to five years, and assessed for
recoverability by determining whether the amortization of the
goodwill balance over its remaining life could be recovered
through undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired
operation.   
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company follows SFASNo144, Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. In
accordance with SFASNo144, long-lived assets, such
as property, plant, and equipment, and purchased intangibles
subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of
assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the
carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the
carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash
flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which
the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the
asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in
the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying
amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer
depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group
classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the
appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.   
Investment Losses and Impairment During 1999 and 2000, the Company invested in a small number of
private companies. The private equity investments are accounted
for on a cost basis since the Company does not have the ability
to exercise significant influence over the investee and the
Companys ownership interest is less than 20%. Under the
cost method of accounting, investments in private companies are
carried at cost and are adjusted only for other-than-temporary
declines in fair value. The Company periodically evaluates
whether any declines in fair value of its investments are
other-than-temporary. This evaluation consists of a review of
qualitative and quantitative factors by members of senior
management, including a review of the investees financial
condition, results of operations, operating trends and other
financial ratios. The Company considers the implied value from
any recent rounds of financing completed by the investee, as
well as market prices of comparable public companies for
purposes of determining estimated fair value. The Company
generally requires its private investees to deliver monthly,
quarterly and annual financial statements to assist in reviewing
relevant financial data and to 56 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
assist in determining whether such data may indicate
other-than-temporary declines in fair value below the
Companys accounting basis. The Company generally considers
a decline to be other-than-temporary if the estimated value is
less than its accounting basis for two consecutive quarters,
absent evidence to the contrary.   
Restructuring During 2001 and 2002, the Company recorded significant
write-offs and accruals in connection with a restructuring
program under Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue
No94-3. These write-offs and accruals include estimates
pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of
contractual obligations related to excess leased facilities and
other contracts. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFASNo146,
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities. This statement addresses financial accounting
and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal
activities, and nullifies EITF Issue No94-3,
Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. This statement
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity be recognized at fair value when the liability
is incurred. The provisions of this statement are effective for
exit or disposal activities that are initiated after
December31, 2002, with early application encouraged. The
adoption of SFASNo146 has not had a material effect
on the Companys consolidated financial statements.   
Research and Development Costs Research and development costs, which consist primarily of
software development costs, are expensed as incurred. Financial
accounting standards provide for the capitalization of certain
software development costs after technological feasibility of
the software is established. Under the Companys current
practice of developing new products and enhancements, the
technological feasibility of the underlying software is not
established until the development of a working model. To date,
the period between achieving technological feasibility and the
general availability of such software has been short; therefore,
software development costs qualifying for capitalization have
been immaterial.   
Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit
Risk The Companys customer base is dispersed across many
different geographic areas throughout North America, Europe,
Asia Pacific and Latin America. Accounts receivable are recorded
at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance
for doubtful accounts is the Companys best estimate of the
amount of probable credit losses in the Companys existing
accounts receivable. The Company determines the allowance based
on historical write-off experience by industry and national
economic data. The majority of the Companys customers are
in the financial services, health care and high technology
industries and are affected by decreased corporate and consumer
spending. The Company reviews its allowance for doubtful
accounts quarterly. Past due balances over 90days and
above a specified amount are reviewed individually for
collectibility. All other balances are reviewed on a pooled
basis. Account balances are charged off against the allowance
after all means of collection have been exhausted and the
potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company does
not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its
customers. During 2002, 2003 and 2004, no single customer accounted for 10%
or more of total revenue. At December31, 2003, no single
customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable. At
December31, 2004, the Company had one customer that
accounted for approximately 15% of accounts receivable. The
Company does not require collateral or other security to support
credit sales, but provides an allowance for doubtful accounts
based on historical experience applied against its aged
receivables and specifically identified risks. 57 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Companys foreign
subsidiaries is the local currency in the country in which the
subsidiary is located. Assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are translated to U.S.dollars at the
exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. Revenues and
expenses are translated at the average monthly rates of exchange
prevailing throughout the year. The translation adjustment
resulting from this process is shown within accumulated other
comprehensive income loss as a component of shareholders
equity. At December31, 2004, we were also exposed to
foreign currency risk related to the assets and liabilities of
our foreign subsidiaries, in particular our United Kingdom
operation denominated in British pounds. Cumulative unrealized
translation gains related to the consolidation of Onyx UK,
including the goodwill and other intangible assets resulting
from the acquisition of Market Solutions Limited, amounted to
$29million at December31, 2004. The unrealized gain
in 2004 specifically associated with the goodwill and other
acquisition-related intangibles of Market Solutions amounted to
$21million. This unrealized translation gain, combined
with the cumulative unrealized translation gains and losses
related to the consolidation of our other foreign subsidiaries,
resulted in net consolidated cumulative unrealized translation
gains of $30million at December31, 2004. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are included
in the consolidated statement of operations as incurred. To
date, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses have not
been significant.   
Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.   
Stock-Based Compensation The Company applies the intrinsic-value-based method of
accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related interpretations, including FASB Interpretation
No44, Accounting for Certain Transactions involving
Stock Compensation, an interpretation of APB Opinion
No25, issued in March 2000, to account for its fixed-plan
stock options. Under this method, compensation expense is
recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price
of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price. Under APB
Opinion No25, because the exercise price of the
Companys employee stock options generally equals the fair
value of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no
compensation expense is generally recognized. Deferred
compensation expense of $2,153,000 was recorded during 1998 for
those situations where the exercise price of an option was lower
than the deemed fair value for financial reporting purposes of
the underlying common stock. No deferred compensation expense
was recorded in 1999 or 2000. In 2001, the Company recorded
deferred compensation expense of $1,840,000 in connection with
the acquisition of RevenueLab, representing the excess of the
fair value of the underlying common stock over the exercise
price for the options assumed by the Company. Deferred
compensation is amortized, on a straight line basis over the
vesting period of the underlying options. Approximately
$11million of the deferred compensation that was recorded
in January 2001 in connection with options granted to employees
of RevenueLab was reversed within shareholders equity
during 2001, 2002 and 2003 upon the employees termination.
Option-related deferred compensation recorded at our initial
public offering was fully amortized as of December31,
2002. The deferred stock-based compensation balance in
connection with the acquisition of RevenueLab was fully
amortized at December31, 2003. 58 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, established accounting and disclosure
requirements using a fair-value-based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation plans. As allowed by
SFASNo123, the Company has elected to continue to
apply the intrinsic-value-based method of accounting described
above, and has adopted only the disclosure requirements of
SFASNo123. The following table illustrates the
effect on net loss if the fair-value-based method had been
applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period.

See Note11 for details of the assumptions used to arrive

Earnings Loss Per Share Basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing net
income loss available to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
Diluted earnings loss per share reflects the potential
dilution of securities by including other common stock
equivalents, including stock options and warrants, in the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for a
period, if dilutive.   
Other Comprehensive Income SFASNo130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, establishes standards for reporting and displaying
comprehensive income and its components in the financial
statements. The only items of other comprehensive income loss
that the Company currently reports are foreign currency
translation adjustments.   
Advertising Advertising costs, which include hired services, collateral and
event-related costs, are expensed as the related promotional
materials are released or activities occur. Advertising expense
was $30million, $21million and $26million
during the years ended December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004,
respectively. 59 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Interest Expense Interest expense, which primarily relates to interest on the
Companys outstanding letters of credit and term loan, was
$118,000, $139,000 and $151,000 during the years ended
December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. Imputed
interest expense related to the purchased technology obligation
was $82,000 during the year ended 2004.   
Business Segments SFASNo131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, establishes standards
for reporting information about operating segments in annual
financial statements. It also establishes standards for related
disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and
major customers. Information related to segment disclosures is
contained in Note15.   
Reclassifications The Company reclassified prior-year amounts for long-term
accrued liabilities, long-term deferred revenue and long-term
deferred rent to conform with the current-year presentation.
Long-term accrued liabilities and long-term deferred rent are
liabilities that will not be settled within one year, while
long-term deferred revenue are deferred revenues that will not
be recognized within one year. Such reclassifications had no
impact on the results of operations or shareholders equity
for any quarter presented.   
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo123
revised 2004, Share-Based Payment
SFAS123R. SFAS123R will require that the
compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions
be recognized in financial statements. That cost will be
measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability
instruments issued. SFAS123R covers a wide range of
share-based compensation arrangements, including share options,
restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share
appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans.
SFAS123R replaces SFAS123, Accounting for
Stock Based Compensation. SFAS123R will be effective
for the Company in the third quarter ending September30,
2005. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of
adopting SFAS123R.

Acquisitions, Purchased Technology, Other Intangible Assets
and Goodwill   
Visuale On April7, 2004, the Company acquired business process
management technology from Visuale, Inc. in an asset acquisition
valued at $41million. Under the terms and conditions of
the purchase agreement, the Company purchased the acquired
technology with a purchase price valued at $41million,
including aan initial payment of $400,000 in cash,
b504,891shares of common stock valued at
$17million, and con the one-year anniversary of
closing, a subsequent payment valued at $10million, to be
paid at the Companys option in either cash or stock. In
March 2005, the Companys board of directors authorized the
Company to settle the one-year anniversary payment obligation in
the form of the Companys common stock. Based on this
decision, the Company reclassified $986,000 from current
liabilities to long-term liabilities in the fourth quarter of
2004. In addition, the Company agreed to make royalty payments
for a period of four years to Visuale on sales of certain
Company products incorporating the acquired technology, with a
guaranteed minimum royalty payment in each of the third and
fourth years following closing of $500,000. The Company also
assumed employee liabilities of $115,000 and incurred
professional fees associated with the acquisition of $155,000.
The above future payments have been recorded on the balance
sheet as purchased technology obligations net of imputed
interest in long-term liabilities. 60 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

In 2002, the Company made significant progress in its efforts to
mitigate excess facility commitments. Specifically, in August
2002, the Company executed a sublease agreement on its
21,000-square-foot facility in 61 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
the United Kingdom that reduced its obligation on seven of the
remaining 14years on the lease, and in November 2002, the
Company executed a lease termination agreement on its former
100,000-square-foot corporate headquarters facility in Bellevue,
Washington. This lease termination resulted in accelerated cash
outflows of approximately $20million during the fourth
quarter of 2002. The Company paid its last monthly lease
obligation of approximately $250,000 associated with this
facility in January 2003, after which the Company relocated its
corporate headquarters and no further obligations remained. The
signing of this agreement, which required the Company to move
its corporate headquarters, resulted in accelerated amortization
of leasehold improvements and furniture, of which approximately
$13million was charged to expense in the fourth quarter
of 2002. An additional $450,000 in accelerated amortization was
charged to expense in January 2003. The most significant mitigation of the Companys excess
facility commitments was completed in December 2002 when the
Company reached an agreement with the landlord, Bellevue Hines
Development, L.L.C. Hines, relating to its 262,000square
feet of office space in Bellevue, Washington. The partial lease
termination reduces the Companys excess facilities in
Bellevue, Washington by approximately 202,000square feet.
The Company continues to lease approximately 60,000square
feet at this facility, which began serving as its new corporate
headquarters effective at the end of January 2003. The new lease
for 60,000square feet expires in December 2013. In
addition to cash payments, the Company issued three five-year
warrants to Hines for the purchase of up to an aggregate of
198,750shares of the Companys common stock,
including a warrant to purchase66,250shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $1038per share, a
warrant to purchase66,250shares of common stock at
an exercise price of $1211per share and a warrant to
purchase66,250shares of common stock at an exercise
price of $1384per share. The lease termination agreement
with Hines provided that, if the Company either underwent a
change of control or issued securities with rights and
preferences superior to the Companys common stock within
two years after the warrants were issued, Hines would have the
option of canceling any unexercised warrants and receiving a
cash cancellation payment of $1840per share in the case
of the $1038 warrants, $1600per share in the case of the
$1211 warrants and $1392per share in the case of the
$1384 warrants. These contingent cash payments totalled
$32million. The Company also entered into a registration
rights agreement with Hines, pursuant to which the Company filed
a registration statement on February14, 2003 covering the
resale of the shares of the Companys common stock subject
to purchase by Hines under the warrants. The warrant value as of
December31, 2002 was estimated at $920,000 based on
athe estimated value of the warrants using the
Black-Scholes model with an expected dividend yield of 00%, a
risk-free interest rate of 50%, volatility of 85% and an
expected life of five years and bthe estimated value of
the cash cancellation payments in the event of a change in
control. The warrants are subject to variable accounting and the
Company is required to mark the warrants to market at each
reporting period. At December31, 2004, the warrant value
was estimated at $52,000 using similar assumptions to those used
at December31, 2002, and is included in long-term
liabilities. The current portion of restructuring-related
liabilities totaled $731,000 at December31, 2004. The accounting for excess facilities is complex and requires
judgment, a consequence of which is that adjustments may be
required to the Companys current restructuring charge. In
particular, based on the terms of the warrants issued in
connection with the partial lease termination of excess
facilities in Bellevue, Washington, the warrants were subject to
variable accounting and were marked to market at each reporting
period prior to January 2005, when the change in control
provision expired. In the first quarter of 2005, the Company
will reclassify the remaining warrant value into equity.   
4.
Investment Losses and Impairment During 1999 and 2000, the Company invested in a small number of
private companies. During 2004, the Company recorded impairment
losses totaling $403,000, relating to other-than-temporary
declines in the Companys remaining cost-basis equity
investment, based on a review of qualitative and quantitative
factors surrounding the financial condition of the investee.
This impairment loss was recorded to reflect the 62 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
investment at its estimated fair value. At December31,
2004, the carrying value of the private equity investment was
$110,000 and was included in other assets.   
5.
Onyx Japan In September 2000, the Company entered into a joint venture with
Softbank Investment Corporation and Prime Systems Corporation to
create Onyx Software Co., Ltd. Onyx Japan, a Japanese
corporation, for the purpose of distributing the Companys
technology and product offerings in Japan. In October 2000, the
Company made an initial contribution of $43million in
exchange for 58% of the outstanding common stock and the joint
venture partners invested $31million for the remaining
42% of the common stock of Onyx Japan. The Company has a
controlling interest in Onyx Japan; therefore, Onyx Japan has
been included in its consolidated financial statements. The
minority shareholders interest in Onyx Japans
earnings or losses is separately reflected in the statement of
operations. Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, Prime Systems
may at any time after September14, 2001, sell its shares
after 90days notice to the Company. The Company has
a right of first refusal to purchase any of Prime Systems
shares that are offered for resale at the same price for which
those shares are being offered to a third party. Further, since
Onyx Japan did not complete an initial public offering on or
before July31, 2003, either the Company or Prime Systems
may terminate the joint venture agreement at its discretion. If
Prime Systems exercises its right of termination for this
reason, the Company has the right, at its election, to either
abuy Prime Systems shares at the current fair
market value as determined by appraisal or bforce a
liquidation of Onyx Japan. The Company has entered into a distribution agreement with Onyx
Japan, which was approved by the minority shareholders, that
provides for a fee to the Company based on license and
maintenance revenues in Japan. During 2002, 2003 and 2004, fees
charged under this agreement were $521,000, $691,000 and
$764,000, respectively. The intercompany fees are eliminated in
consolidation; however, the Company allocates 42% of the fees to
the minority shareholders. Although profitable in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 and
in the first and fourth quarters of 2004, Onyx Japan incurred
substantial losses in previous periods. The minority
shareholders capital account balance as of
December31, 2004 was $106,000. Additional Onyx Japan
losses above approximately $252,000 in the aggregate will be
absorbed 100% by the Company, as compared to 58% in prior
periods. Restructuring efforts carried out in the second half of 2002
significantly reduced the operating expenses of Onyx Japan and
increased the probability that Onyx Japan can be cash flow
positive, as evidenced by the profits generated by Onyx Japan in
the third and fourth quarters of 2003 and in the first and
fourth quarters of 2004. Nevertheless, additional funding may be
required to continue the operation of the joint venture. If Onyx
Japan continues to incur losses and no additional capital is
invested, the Company may have to further restructure its
operations in Japan.

Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation includes stock-based charges resulting
from option-related deferred compensation recorded at the
Companys initial public offering and the portion of
acquisition-related consideration conditioned on the continued
tenure of key employees of certain acquired businesses, which
has been classified as compensation expense. It also includes
the issuance of common stock and options to contractors in
return for their services. 63 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Line of Credit The Company has a total $100million working capital
revolving line of credit and a $500,000 term loan facility with
Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB. The $100million working
capital revolving line of credit is split between an
$80million domestic facility and a $20million loan
guarantee by the Export Import Bank of the United States, or
Exim Bank. All of the facilities are secured by accounts
receivable, property and equipment and intellectual property.
The domestic facility allows the Company to borrow up to the
lesser of a70% of eligible domestic and individually
approved foreign accounts receivable and
b$80million. The Exim Bank facility allows the
Company to borrow up to the lesser of a75% of eligible
foreign accounts receivable and b$20million. The
amount available to borrow under the working capital revolving
line of credit is reduced by reserves for outstanding standby
letters of credit issued by SVB on the Companys behalf and
50% of any borrowings under the term loan facility. These
reserves amounted to $49million and $02million,
respectively, as of December31, 2004. Borrowings under the
term loan bear interest at SVBs prime rate, which was
525% as of December31, 2004, plus 2%, subject to a
minimum rate of 6%. Any borrowings under the revolving line
would bear interest at SVBs prime rate plus 15%, subject
to a minimum rate of 6%. The Company had no borrowings under the
revolving line as of December31, 2004. The loan agreements
require that the Company maintain certain financial covenants
based on its adjusted quick ratio and tangible net worth. The
Company was in compliance with these covenants as of
December31, 2004. The Company paid a $45,000 commitment
fee, plus interest and various administrative fees for these
credit facilities. The Company is in the process of renewing its
loan and security agreement with SVB, which expires
March30, 2005. The 64 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Company expects the agreement to be renewed with terms that are
acceptable to the Company. If the Company is unable to negotiate
a new agreement with SVB that has terms acceptable to the
Company or if the Company is unable to maintain compliance with
its covenants in the future and SVB decides to restrict its cash
deposits, the Companys liquidity would be further limited
and its business, financial condition and operating results
could be materially harmed.

Third-Party License Agreements The Company has entered into various agreements that allow the
Company to incorporate licensed technology into its products or
that allow the Company the right to sell separately the licensed
technology. The Company incurs royalty fees under these
agreements that are based on a predetermined fee per license
sold or fixed fee per quarter. Royalty costs incurred under
these agreements are recognized as products are licensed and are
included in cost of license revenues. These amounts totaled
$11million, $760,000 and $965,000 in 2002, 2003 and 2004.
As of December31, 2004, future minimum commitments under
these royalty arrangements are anticipated to be approximately
$12million, of which $856,000 is included in long-term
purchased technology obligation, net of $144,000 of imputed
interest.   
Term Loan The Company received funding of $500,000 from a term loan
facility in April 2004, which was used to buy out an equipment
lease. The term loan facility has a three-year term and bears
interest at SVBs prime rate plus 20%, subject to a
minimum rate of 60%. The Company makes monthly principal
payments of $14,000, and at December31, 2004, had a
short-term loan balance of $167,000 and a long-term loan balance
of $222,000.   
Purchased Technology Obligation On April7, 2004, the Company acquired business process
management technology from Visuale, Inc. in an asset acquisition
valued at $41million. Under the terms and conditions of
the purchase agreement, the Company purchased the acquired
technology with a purchase price valued at $41million,
including aan initial payment of $400,000 in cash,
b504,891shares of common stock valued at
$17million, and con the one-year anniversary of
closing, a subsequent payment valued at $10million, to be
paid at the Companys option in either cash or stock. In
March 2005, the Companys board of directors authorized the
Company to settle the one-year anniversary obligation in the
form of the Companys common stock. Based on this decision,
the Company reclassified $986,000 from current liabilities to
long-term liabilities in the fourth quarter of 2004. In
addition, the Company agreed to make royalty payments for a
period of four years to Visuale on sales of certain Company
products incorporating the acquired technology, with a
guaranteed minimum royalty payment in each of the third and
fourth years following closing of $500,000, which is included in
the third-party royalty commitment above. The Company also
assumed employee liabilities of $115,000 and incurred
professional fees associated with the acquisition of $155,000.
The above future payments have been recorded on the balance
sheet as purchased technology obligations net of imputed
interest in long-term liabilities. 66 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Guarantees Indemnification and warranty provisions contained within our
customer license and service agreements are generally consistent
with those prevalent in our industry. The duration of our
product warranties generally does not exceed 90days
following delivery of our products. We have not incurred
significant obligations under customer indemnification or
warranty provisions historically and do not expect to incur
significant obligations in the future. Accordingly, we do not
maintain accruals for potential customer indemnification or
warranty-related obligations.

Shareholders Equity   
Shareholder Rights Plan On October22, 1999, the Companys board of directors
adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan the Rights Plan in which
preferred stock purchase rights Rights were distributed as a
dividend at the rate of one Right for each share of common stock
held as of the close of business on November9, 1999. The
Company adopted the Rights Plan to guard against partial tender
offers and other abusive tactics that might be used in an
attempt to gain control of the Company without paying all
shareholders a fair price for their shares. The Rights Plan,
which expires on November9, 2009, will not prevent
takeovers, but it is designed to deter coercive takeover tactics
and to encourage anyone attempting to acquire the Company to
first negotiate with the board. Each Right will entitle each shareholder to buy one
one-hundredth of a newly issued share of SeriesA
participating cumulative preferred stock of the Company at an
exercise price of $6000per one one-hundredth of a
preferred share. The Rights will be exercisable only if a person
or group, other than an exempted person, makes a tender offer
for, or acquires beneficial ownership of, 15% or more of the
Companys then-outstanding common stock. If any person other than an exempted person becomes the
beneficial owner of 15% or more of the Companys
outstanding common stock, then each Right not owned by such
person or certain related parties will entitle its holder to
purchase, at the Rights then current exercise price,
shares of the Companys common stock or, in certain
circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the
Company having a market value equal to twice the then-current
exercise price. In addition, if, after a person becomes the
beneficial owner of 15% or more of the Companys
outstanding common stock, the Company is acquired in a merger or
other business combination transaction, or sells 50% or more of
its assets or earning power to another person, each Right will
entitle its holder to purchase, at the Rights then current
exercise price, shares of common stock of such other person
having a market value equal to twice the then-current exercise
price. The Companys board of directors will generally be entitled
to redeem the Rights at $01per Right at any time prior to
a person or group acquiring 15% or more of the Companys
common stock.   
Public Offering In February 2002, the Company completed a public offering of
1,581,250shares of its common stock at a purchase price to
the public of $1400per share from its $1000million
shelf registration statement, including 150,000shares
issued pursuant to the exercise of the over-allotment option
granted to Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, the sole underwriter for
the offering. The proceeds to the Company totaled
$205million after deducting the costs of the offering.   
Private Offering In May 2003, the Company completed a private offering of
1,038,475shares of its common stock at a purchase price of
$260per share with an existing institutional investor and
97,222shares of its common stock 67 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
at a purchase price of $322per share with certain
officers and directors of the Company. The proceeds to the
Company totaled approximately $28million after deducting
the costs of the offering. In connection with the private
offering the Company granted anti-dilution rights to the
existing institutional investor whereby the Company would issue
warrants to purchase common stock if additional shares of common
stock had been sold at a price less than $260per share
before November19, 2003. The Company did not sell any
additional shares of common stock before November19, 2003,
and, as such, no additional shares were issued pursuant to the
anti-dilution provisions of the private offering.   
Increase in Authorized Capital On July23, 2003, the Companys shareholders approved
an amendment to the Companys restated articles of
incorporation increasing the number of authorized shares of the
Companys stock after the reverse stock split from
25,000,000 including 20,000,000shares of common stock and
5,000,000shares of preferred stock to
100,000,000shares including 80,000,000shares of
common stock and 20,000,000shares of preferred stock.   
Warrants for Common Stock As part of a lease termination agreement, the Company agreed to
issue three five-year warrants to Hines, the landlord of its
Bellevue, Washington facility, for the purchase of up to an
aggregate of 198,750shares of the Companys common
stock, including a warrant to purchase66,250shares
of common stock at an exercise price of $1038per share, a
warrant to purchase66,250shares of common stock at
an exercise price of $1211per share and a warrant to
purchase66,250shares of common stock at an exercise
price of $1384per share. The lease termination agreement
with Hines provided that, if the Company either underwent a
change of control or issued securities with rights and
preferences superior to the Companys common stock within
two years after the warrants were issued, Hines would have the
option of canceling any unexercised warrants and receiving a
cash cancellation payment of $1840per share in the case
of the $1038 warrants, $1600per share in the case of the
$1211 warrants and $1392per share in the case of the
$1384 warrants. These contingent cash payments totalled
$32million. The Company agreed to enter into a
registration rights agreement with Hines, pursuant to which the
Company filed a registration statement on February14, 2003
covering the resale of the shares of the Companys common
stock subject to purchase by Hines under the warrants. The
warrant value as of December31, 2002 was estimated at
$920,000 based on athe estimated value of the warrants
using the Black-Scholes model with an expected dividend yield of
00%, a risk-free interest rate of 50%, volatility of 85% and
an expected life of five years and bthe estimated value
of the cash cancellation payments in the event of a change in
control. The warrants were subject to variable accounting and
the Company was required to mark the warrants to market at each
reporting period until January 2005, when the Company will
reclassify the remaining warrant value into equity. At
December31, 2004, the warrant value was estimated at
$52,000 using similar assumptions to those used at
December31, 2002, and is included in long-term liabilities.   
Common Stock Issued in Conjunction with Purchased
Technology On April7, 2004, the Company acquired business process
management technology from Visuale in an asset acquisition
valued at $41million. Under the terms and conditions of
the purchase agreement, the Company purchased the acquired
technology with a purchase price valued at $41million,
including aan initial payment of $400,000 in cash,
b504,891shares of common stock valued at
$17million, and con the one-year anniversary of
closing, a subsequent payment valued at $10million, to be
paid at the Companys option in either cash or stock. In
March 2005, our board of directors authorized the Company to
settle the one-year anniversary obligation in the form of the
Companys common stock. Based on this decision, the Company
reclassified $986,000 from current liabilities to long-term
liabilities in the fourth quarter of 2004. In addition, the
Company agreed to make royalty payments for a period of four
years to Visuale on sales of 68 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
certain Company products incorporating the acquired technology,
with a guaranteed minimum royalty payment in each of the third
and fourth years following closing of $500,000. The Company also
assumed employee liabilities of $115,000 and incurred
professional fees associated with the acquisition of $155,000.
The above future payments have been recorded on the balance
sheet as purchased technology obligations net of imputed
interest in long-term liabilities.   
1994 Combined Incentive and Nonqualified Stock Option
Plan Under the terms of the 1994 Combined Incentive and Nonqualified
Stock Option Plan the 1994 option plan, the board of directors
may grant incentive and nonqualified stock options to employees,
officers, directors, agents, consultants and independent
contractors of the Company. There were 2,500,000shares of
common stock reserved under the 1994 option plan. Generally, the
Company grants stock options with exercise prices equal to the
fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, as
determined by the Companys board of directors. Options
generally vest over a four and one-half year period; 25% vest
after 18months and an additional 125% vesting every six
months thereafter. Options generally expire ten years from the
date of grant. In October 1998, the board of directors suspended
the 1994 option plan and determined that no further grants are
to be made pursuant to the 1994 option plan. The 1994 option
plan was automatically terminated on April19, 2004 in
accordance with its original terms.   
1998 Stock Incentive Compensation Plan The 1998 Stock Incentive Compensation Plan the 1998 option
plan provides for both stock options and restricted stock
awards to employees, officers, directors, agents, advisors,
consultants and independent contractors of the Company. There
were 750,000shares of common stock reserved under the 1998
option plan and the plan provides that any options cancelled and
returned to the 1994 option plan shall become available for
future grant under the 1998 option plan. The 1998 option plan
provides for an annual increase to be added on the first day of
each fiscal year beginning in 2000 equal to the lesser of
a837,882shares or b5% of the average
common shares outstanding used to calculate fully diluted
earnings per share, as reported for the preceding year.
Accordingly, on January1, 2002, 2003 and 2004, the 1998
option plan pool was increased by 504,600shares,
624,139shares and 672,100, respectively. On
January1, 2005, the 1998 option plan pool was increased by
718,200shares. Options granted under the 1998 option plan
generally vest and become exercisable over a four-year period.
Initial option grants are typically structured with 25% vesting
after 12months, and an additional 2083% vesting every
month thereafter; additional option grants are typically
structured with 2083% vesting monthly over a four-year period.   
2001 Nonofficer Employee Stock Compensation Plan The 2001 Nonofficer Employee Stock Compensation Plan the NOE
plan provides for both stock options and restricted stock
awards to employees, agents, advisors, consultants and
independent contractors of the Company, but does not allow for
grants to any directors or officers of the Company. The board of
directors initially reserved 250,000shares for issuance
under the NOE plan in January 2001, and reserved an additional
625,000shares in April 2001. Additional shares may be
reserved for issuance under the NOE plan through authorization
by the board of directors. Options granted to new employees
under the NOE plan generally vest and become exercisable over a
four-year period with 25% vesting after 12months and an
additional 2083% vesting every month thereafter. Options
granted to existing employees under the NOE plan generally vest
and become exercisable over a four-year period with 2083%
vesting every month.   
Chief Executive Officer Stock Compensation Plan On June7, 2004, the Company hired Janice P. Anderson as
its Chief Executive Officer. In connection with the hiring of
Ms.Anderson, the Companys Compensation Committee
approved initial grants of options 69 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
for the Companys common stock consisting of four tranches,
all of which were granted outside of the Companys stock
option plans: aoptions to
purchase300,000shares at an exercise price of
$3855per share, the fair market value of the
Companys common stock on Ms.Andersons hire
date of June7, 2004, boptions to
purchase50,000shares at an exercise price of
$3855per share, coptions to
purchase125,000shares at an exercise price of
$550per share, and doptions to
purchase125,000shares at an exercise price of
$1150per share. The option grant of 50,000 vests 100% at the end of four years
from the date of grant, but has an acceleration clause that
allows for immediate vesting acceleration in the event that the
Company achieved certain operating results for fiscal year 2004,
which the Company did not achieve. All other options vest over
four years, with 25% vesting on the first anniversary of the
date of grant and 2083% vesting monthly thereafter. The term of
each option is ten years. Vesting of all or specified portions
of the options accelerates upon cessation of
Ms.Andersons employment in certain circumstances. In addition, the Company agreed to make future option grants to
Ms.Anderson of 135,000shares on the first
anniversary of her commencement of employment and
100,000shares on each of the second and third
anniversaries of her commencement of employment, subject to her
continued employment on those dates. In January 2005, the
Company executed an amendment to Ms.Andersons
employment contract that amended the grant date of the 135,000
options from Ms.Andersons first anniversary of
employment to January 2005. These options will be made under the
1998 option plan, will have exercise prices equal to fair market
value on the date of grant and will vest monthly over four years.

1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan The 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP permits
eligible employees of the Company and its subsidiaries to
purchase common stock through payroll deductions of up to 10% of
their compensation. The Company authorized the issuance under
the ESPP of a total of 250,000shares of common stock, plus
an automatic annual increase, to be added on the first day of
the fiscal year beginning in 2000, equal to the least of
a100,000shares, b12% of the average
common shares outstanding as used to calculate fully diluted
earnings per share as reported in the annual report for the
preceding year, or ca lower amount determined by the
board of directors. The ESPP provides for six-month offering periods, beginning on
each January 1 and July 1. The price of the common stock
purchased under the ESPP is the lesser of 85% of the fair market
value on the first day of an offering period and 85% of the fair
market value on the last day of an offering period. The ESPP
does not have a fixed expiration date, but the Companys
board of directors may terminate it at any time. In April 2001, the board of directors adopted an amendment to
the ESPP, which was approved by the shareholders on June7,
2001. The amended ESPP is being implemented by a series of
offerings that commence on January 1 and July1 of each
year and end on the second December31 and June30,
respectively, occurring after such date, each referred to as an
amended offering period; provided, however, that the offering
period that began on January1, 2001 ended on June30,
2001. Each offering period after the amendment will consist of
four consecutive six-month purchase periods; provided, however,
that the offering period that began on January1, 2001
consisted of one six-month purchase period. During the years ended December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004,
77,891shares, 109,340shares and 112,457shares
of common stock were purchased under the ESPP, respectively. At
December31, 2004, the Company had a total of
311,312shares of common stock reserved for future issuance
under the ESPP. On January1, 2005, an additional
100,000shares became available for issuance pursuant to
the automatic plan increase. 71 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Fair Value of Stock Options and Employee Stock Purchase
Rights Under SFASNo123 The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for periods
after the Companys initial public offering and the minimum
value option pricing model for periods prior to the initial
public offering. Subsequent to the Companys initial public
offering, the volatility of the Companys stock was based
on actual prices subsequent to the initial month of trading. The
following weighted average assumptions were utilized in arriving
at the fair value of each option grant

For purposes of the pro forma disclosures, the estimated
weighted average fair value of the options granted with exercise
prices equal to fair market value on the date of grant,
estimated to be $1000, $280 and $204 during 2002, 2003 and
2004, respectively, is amortized to expense over the
options vesting period. The estimated weighted average
fair value of 250,000 options granted with exercise prices in
excess of the fair market value on the date of grant, were
estimated to be $166 during 2004. There were no options granted
in 2002 and 2003 with exercise prices in excess of the fair
market value on the date of grant. There were no options granted
in 2002, 2003 and 2004 with exercise prices below fair market
value on the date of grant. The fair value of employees stock purchase rights under
the ESPP during 2002 was estimated using the Black-Scholes model
with an expected dividend yield of 00%, a risk-free interest
rate of 15%, volatility of 85% and an expected life of
125years. The fair value of employees stock
purchase rights under the ESPP during 2003 was estimated using

Outstanding stock options of 2,456,673, 3,242,208 and 4,491,476
at December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively, were
excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share
because their effect was antidilutive see Note11 for
additional stock option information. Outstanding options will
be included in the computation of diluted earnings per share in
future periods to the extent their effects are dilutive. If the
Company had been profitable during any of the periods reported,
based on the average price of the Companys common stock
during each period using the treasury stock method, the
approximate number of dilutive options included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share would have been
210,000shares, 111,000shares and
128,000shares, respectively, during the years ended
December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004.   
In January 2003, the Company issued warrants to
purchase198,750shares of its common stock at
exercise prices ranging from $1038 to $1384per share in
connection with the termination of excess facilities. In May
2003, the Company issued warrants to
purchase6,250shares of its common stock at an
exercise price of $325per share in connection with the
private placement of the Companys common stock in May
2003. There were no warrants outstanding prior to January 2003.
Outstanding warrants were excluded from the computation of
diluted earnings per share for the year ended December31,
2004 because their effect was antidilutive. Outstanding warrants
will be included in the computation of diluted earnings per
share in future periods to the extent their effects are dilutive.

At December31, 2004, the Company had federal net operating
loss carryforwards of $1085million, and state and foreign
net operating loss carryforwards reported on a federal rate
equivalent basis of $104million and $83million,
respectively, which expire between 2005 and 2024. Additionally,
the Company had capital loss, research and development and
foreign tax credit carryforwards of $20million 28million and $09million, respectively, which
expire between 2005 and 2024. Utilization of these carryforwards
depends on the recognition of future taxable income. The
Companys ability to utilize net operating loss
carryforwards may be limited in the event of a change in
ownership, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. To the
extent that any single-year loss is not utilized to the full
amount of the limitation, such unused loss is carried forward to
subsequent years until the earlier of its utilization or the
expiration of the relevant carryforward period. To the extent
that net operating losses, when realized, relate to stock option
deductions of approximately $74million, the resulting tax
benefits will be credited to shareholders equity. 74 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Deferred tax assets reflect the net tax effects of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the

Since the Companys utilization of these deferred tax
assets depends on future profits, which are not assured, a
valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax assets has
been provided, except for certain deferred tax assets related to
foreign operations. The valuation allowance for deferred tax
assets increased by $29million during 2003 and by
$11million during 2004.

Employee Benefit Plan The Company maintains a profit-sharing retirement plan for
eligible employees under the provisions of Internal Revenue Code
Section401k. Participants may defer up to 60% of their
annual compensation on a pretax basis, subject to maximum limits
on contributions prescribed by law. Contributions by the Company
are at the discretion of the board of directors. In 2002, 2003
and 2004, no employer contributions were made.   
15.
Segment and Geographic Information The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the
design, development, marketing and support of enterprise-wide
solutions designed to promote strategic business improvement and
revenue growth by enhancing the way businesses market, sell and
service their products. Substantially all revenue results from
the licensing of the Companys software products and
related consulting and customer support
maintenanceservices. The Companys chief operating
decision-maker reviews financial information presented on a
consolidated basis, accompanied by disaggregated information
about revenue by geographic region for purposes of making
operating decisions and assessing financial performance.
Accordingly, the Company considers itself to be in a single
industry segment, specifically the license, implementation and
support of its software applications and to have only one
operating segment. The Company does not prepare reports for, or
measure the performance of, its individual software applications
and, accordingly, the Company has not presented revenue or any
other related financial information by individual software
product. 75 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
The Company evaluates the performance of its geographic regions
primarily based on revenues. In addition, the Companys
assets are primarily located in its corporate office in the
United States and not allocated to any specific region. The
Company does not produce reports for, or measure the performance
of, its geographic regions on any asset-based metrics.
Therefore, geographic information is presented only for
revenues. Total revenue of the North America segment, primarily
relates to revenue within the United States. Total revenue outside of North America for the years ended
December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 were $248million 229million and $206million, respectively. The following geographic information is presented for the years

Litigation and Contingencies The Company is currently not subject to any legal proceedings
that it believes would have a material adverse effect on the
Company.   
17.
Liquidity The Company believes its revenue performance will be comparable
to the most recent quarterly periods reported and that the
Companys existing cash and cash equivalents will be
sufficient to meet its capital requirements for at least the
next 12months. Should the Companys revenue results
for subsequent quarters fall significantly below the results
achieved in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company would likely
take action to restructure its operations to preserve its cash.
Such actions would primarily consist of reductions in headcount.
Because the level of cash can negatively affect the
Companys sales efforts, the Company may seek additional
funds in the future through public or private equity financing
or from other sources to fund its operations and add flexibility
in pursuing its growth strategy. The Company may experience
difficulty in obtaining funding on favorable terms, if at all. The Company has a total $100million working capital
revolving line of credit and a $500,000 term loan facility with
SVB. The $100million working capital revolving line of
credit is split between an $80million domestic facility
and a $20million Exim Bank facility. All of the
facilities are secured by accounts receivable, property and
equipment and intellectual property. The domestic facility
allows the Company to borrow up to the lesser of a70% of
eligible domestic and individually approved foreign accounts
receivable and b$80million. The Exim Bank
facility allows the Company to borrow up to the lesser of
a75% of eligible foreign accounts receivable and
b$20million. The amount available to borrow under
the working capital revolving line of credit is reduced by
reserves for outstanding standby letters of credit issued by SVB
on the Companys behalf and 50% of any borrowings under the
term loan facility. These reserves amounted to $49million
and $02million, respectively, as of December31,
2004. Borrowings under the term loan bear interest at SVBs
prime rate, which was 525% as of December31, 2004, plus
2%, subject to a minimum rate of 6%. Any borrowings under the
revolving line would bear interest at SVBs prime rate plus
15%, subject to a minimum rate of 6%. The Company had no
borrowings under the revolving line as of December31,
2004. The 76 Table of Contents ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
loan agreements require that the Company maintain certain
financial covenants based on its adjusted quick ratio and
tangible net worth. The Company was in compliance with these
covenants as of December31, 2004. The Company paid a
$45,000 commitment fee, plus interest and various administrative
fees, for these credit facilities. The Company is in the process
of renewing its loan and security agreement with SVB, which
expires on March30, 2005. The Company expects the
agreement to be renewed with terms that are acceptable to the
Company. If the Company is unable to negotiate a new agreement
with SVB that has terms acceptable to the Company or if the
Company is unable to maintain compliance with its covenants in
the future and SVB decides to restrict its cash deposits, the
Companys liquidity would be further limited and its
business, financial condition and operating results could be
materially harmed. 77 Table of Contents

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as
defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange
Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. The
controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision of our
Audit Committee, and with the participation of management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable
assurance that ithe information required to be disclosed
by us in this Annual Report on Form10-K was recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms and
iiinformation required to be disclosed by us in our
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our
financial reporting and the preparation of our financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Our management assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2004. In making this assessment, our
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment and those
criteria, our management believes that, as of December31,
2004, our internal control over financial reporting is
effective. Our independent registered public accounting firm,
KPMG LLP, has issued an attestation report on managements
assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
That report is included on page47 of this Report on
Form10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During 2004, we made numerous changes to our controls and
procedures as part of our ongoing monitoring of our controls.
None of these changes, however, has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure
controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent or
detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how
well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Onyx have
been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of
the controls. The 78 Table of Contents design of any system of controls is based in part on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we can
provide no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving
its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to
future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions or
deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or
procedures.
