CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AS OF DECEMBER 31, 1996 AND 1995
TOGETHER WITH REPORT OF 
INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS          REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To Western Pacific Airlines, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of WESTERN 
PACIFIC AIRLINES, INC. a Delaware corporation AND SUBSIDIARIES as of 
December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the related consolidated statements of 
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended and 
for the period from inception April 12, 1994 to December 31, 1994. These 
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on 
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the financial position of Western Pacific Airlines, 
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of its 
operations and its cash flows for the years then ended and for the period from 
inception April 12, 1994 to December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles.                     ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1996 AND 1995 1 ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS Western Pacific Airlines, Inc. Western Pacific or the Company, commenced 
commercial flight operations on April 28, 1995, as a low-cost, low-fare 
airline from its hub at Colorado Springs Airport in Colorado Springs, 
Colorado. Western Pacific provides up to 38 daily round trips between 
Colorado Springs and Seattle, San Francisco, Portland, Los Angeles, San Diego, 
Phoenix, Houston, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Kansas City, 
Atlanta, Indianapolis, Orlando, Miami, Chicago-Midway, Washington-Dulles and 
Newark with a fleet of 15 modern, 138-passenger Boeing 737-300 aircraft, of 
which 14 are under operating leases with original terms of either five or ten 
years, and one has been purchased.
During 1996, Western Pacific assisted in the start-up of a regional airline, 
Mountain Air Express, Inc. MAX to carry traffic initially into and out of 
Colorado ski markets and other small markets that cannot support jet traffic. 
MAX is an independent company with its own operating certificate and 
management. MAX commenced flight operations on December 15, 1996, with four 
Dornier 328 aircraft with seating capacity of 32 passengers each. MAX serves 
Aspen/Snowmass, Crested Butte/Gunnison, Ft. Collins and Grand Junction, 
Colorado, Santa Fe, New Mexico, and Casper and Cheyenne, Wyoming. Western 
Pacific owns approximately 57% of the outstanding voting stock of MAX.
In November 1996, Colorado Springs Car Rental, Inc., a Thrifty Rent-A-Car 
franchise and a 100% owned subsidiary of Western Pacific, commenced operations 
from its base in Colorado Springs.   MANAGEMENT'S PLANS
The Company initially selected Colorado Springs as its operating hub because 
of its unique and favorable position in the Denver/Colorado Springs market, 
which is the seventh largest air travel market in the United States. Before 
the Company began service at Colorado Springs Airport, air service available 
in Colorado Springs was characterized by high fares and limited flights. 
During 1996, the Company competitors, both in Colorado Springs and in 
Denver, began to more aggressively match the Company low fares. 
Additionally, two U.S. airline accidents which occurred in May and July 1996 
caused many travelers to avoid the low-cost, startup carriers, including the 
Company, over the late summer and fall of 1996. These events significantly 
impacted the Company results of operations during 1996.
The Company growth plan and business strategy had been focused on developing 
its routes and expanding the markets it serves from its Colorado Springs hub 
based on the Company low-fare, no frills, low-cost structure and a 
simplified approach to airline operations. The Company initial route 
structure was built around providing low frequency, scheduled service to high 
density, high volume primary travel markets, such as Los Angeles, San 
Francisco, New York-Newark, Washington, D.C. and Chicago-Midway and strong 
secondary travel markets such as Oklahoma City, Phoenix and Indianapolis. The 
Company believes that after almost two years of flight service, it has 
successfully established itself within this targeted market. With the 
addition of several new members to its management team in late 1996 and the 
expansion of its fleet of aircraft, the Company has decided to expand its 
focus, not only to retain its existing customer base of leisure travelers, but 
also to attract the value-conscious business traveler. To accomplish this, in 
February 1997, the Company initiated a schedule change, adding flights to all 
cities it served except Houston, Miami and Portland, while discontinuing 
service to its unprofitable routes to Nashville, San Antonio, Ontario, and Las 
Vegas. The additional flights increased capacity by 21% and the average hours 
of daily aircraft utilization by 19%. This schedule change was implemented to 
provide better aircraft utilization and to offer more flight and connecting 
opportunities for both leisure and business travelers. As the Company expands 
the size of its aircraft fleet, the Company strategy will be to increase 
both service frequency and the number of markets served in order to build an 
efficient, low-cost hub and spoke air transportation network targeted at the 
value conscious leisure and business traveler.
An integral part of the Company initial business strategy was a streamlined 
ticketless reservation system. However, as call volumes to the Company 
reservation center increased, the Company existing proprietary reservation 
system was unable to handle such call volume. Therefore, in order to remedy 
this growing problem as well as increase its ticket distribution to the flying 
public, during March 1997, the Company entered into agreements with several 
computer reservation systems CRS that allow travel agents the ability to 
directly book seats on the Company aircraft.
Western Pacific is based in Colorado Springs as a result of the initial belief 
that it could function effectively as an alternative airport to Denver 
International Airport DIA for the Denver/Colorado Springs market. As 
scheduled air carrier operations moved from Stapleton International Airport to 
DIA in February of 1995, a significant adverse public reaction developed. 
This was primarily due to the combination of the increased distance to the 
airport for a large portion of the metro Denver population and the increased 
fares associated with the higher cost of operations at DIA. In addition, the 
lower fares offered by Western Pacific not only provided significant market 
stimulation in Colorado Springs, but also provided significant incentive for 
Denver passengers to drive to Colorado Springs Airport. While this trend 
continued throughout the balance of 1995 and well into 1996, underlying 
factors surfaced which made the continued expansion of Western Pacific 
Airlines at Colorado Springs Airport, to the exclusion of DIA, impractical.
With the advent of low fare service available out of DIA as a result of 
Frontier Airline Frontier entry into the Denver market, fewer passengers 
were willing to make the drive to Colorado Springs Airport. In addition, 
United Airlines began to match the fare offerings of Western Pacific and 
Frontier in selected markets which further reduced the incentive for 
passengers to make the drive from Denver to Colorado Springs. At the same 
time, carriers who had served the Colorado Springs market only on a limited 
basis prior to Western Pacific commencement of operations at Colorado 
Springs Airport, began to schedule additional flights. All of these factors 
had a dampening effect on the traffic available to Western Pacific at Colorado 
Springs Airport. Therefore, as capacity increased, it became increasingly 
difficult to stimulate additional traffic at acceptable fare levels. The 
traffic erosion occurred in spite of the fact that average fares continued to 
decline on a year over year basis. The combination of all these factors has 
led to management conclusion that given current capacity and traffic levels 
in Colorado Springs, Western Pacific prospects for significant growth in 
this market could be significantly limited.
With this in mind, management is actively exploring an entry into the Denver 
market. While numerous Denver/Colorado Springs schedule alternatives are 
under consideration, each would appear to provide favorable economics for 
Western Pacific.
As is discussed above, the Company new management has taken several steps 
during late 1996 and early 1997 to turn around the financial condition and 
financial performance of the Company. These steps included i a significant 
schedule change on February 2, 1997, ii a commitment to begin service in 
Denver in June 1997, iii entering into an agreement to multi-host on the 
SABRE CRS beginning March 7, 1997, which allows direct connectivity with 
travel agents worldwide, iv a focused marketing and sales plan targeted to 
the value conscious leisure and business traveler and v entering into an 
agreement with a third-party to outsource its technology support systems. To 
date, with the exception of initiating service to Denver which is not planned 
to occur until June 1997, the above have had a significant impact on the 
Company operations.
In early 1997 following the announcement of the February 2 schedule change, 
the Company began listing its flight schedules in several CRS systems on a 
view only capability. This allowed travel agents to view Western Pacific 
flight and fare schedules but still required them to telephone Western 
Pacific reservation office to actually book the flights. Telephone call 
volume to the Western Pacific reservation center increased from an average of 
20,000 calls per day in January 1997 to in excess of 150,000 calls per day of 
which only about 10,200 per day could be answered by Western Pacific 
reservation staff using its internal reservation systems. As a result of this 
dramatic increase in telephone volume, certain design flaws were identified in 
Western Pacific computer based reservation system. Following a 
comprehensive review of various alternative solutions, Western Pacific 
determined that the most expedient and cost effective solution was to join the 
SABRE multi-host system, effective March 7, 1997. While Western Pacific is 
still reviewing its distribution strategies, the demand for Western Pacific 
product on the CRS has been much greater than management had anticipated. 
Ticket sales in February 1997 exceeded actual travel in February 1997 by over 
$11 million. Western Pacific expects that this additional demand will 
positively impact its results of operations during the spring and summer of 
1997, and also positively impact its cash flow.
Management also expects the outsourcing of its technology support function 
Note 12 to improve cash flow as a result of certain monthly payments being 
satisfied through the issuance of common stock and from the proceeds of the 
sale of certain of its technology assets to the outsourcer.
In addition to the above, the Company is taking certain short-term measures to 
preserve its cash resources through the months of April and May which are 
generally lower revenue periods in the airline industry. Among other 
measures, the Company is currently negotiating agreements with certain of its 
aircraft lessors to defer lease payments during the months of April through 
June, an agreement with its major fuel supplier for an extension of payment 
terms on fuel payments, and an agreement with its provider of heavy 
maintenance for the extension of payment terms for the months of April and May 
from 30 days to 60 days.
OPERATIONAL AND INDUSTRY RISKS
The airline industry is characterized by low gross profit margins and high 
fixed costs. The expenses of operating each flight do not vary significantly 
with the number of passengers carried and, therefore, a relatively small 
change in the number of passengers carried or in fare pricing or traffic mix 
could have a disproportionate effect on operating and financial results. 
Accordingly, a minor shortfall from expected revenue levels could have a 
material adverse effect on the Company growth or its financial performance.
The airline industry is highly sensitive to general economic conditions. 
Because a substantial portion of airline travel both business and personal 
is discretionary, the industry tends to experience adverse financial results 
during general economic downturns. Any prolonged general reduction in airline 
passenger traffic may adversely affect the Company. In addition, the airline 
industry tends to be seasonal in nature. The Company expects that based on 
its experience, February, April, May, September and October of each year will 
be periods with lower load factors and lower yields.
Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of the Company operating costs 
and significant increases in fuel costs would materially affect the Company 
operating results. Both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many 
economic and political factors and events occurring throughout the world which 
the Company can neither control nor accurately predict. In the event of a 
fuel shortage resulting from a disruption of oil imports or otherwise, higher 
fuel prices or curtailment of scheduled service could result. The Company has 
no agreement assuring the availability and price stability of fuel.
The airline industry is highly competitive and, therefore, the competitive 
reaction of other airlines in markets that the Company plans to enter, 
particularly Denver, could also have a material adverse effect on the 
Company results of operations and financial condition. 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Western Pacific, 
MAX, and Colorado Springs Car Rental, Inc. All significant intercompany 
accounts have been eliminated. The minority stockholders' share of MAX net 
loss and stockholders' equity has been presented as minority interest in the 
accompanying consolidated financial statements.
PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
RESTRUCTURING CHARGE
During the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company initiated a restructuring 
program designed to expand its focus from its existing base of leisure 
travelers, to attract the value-conscious business traveler. The initiation 
of the restructuring program resulted in a pre-tax charge of $77 million 
during the fourth quarter of 1996. The charge principally reflects severance 
costs for former members of senior management that have or will be replaced, 
along with the write-off of the cost to develop and implement the Company 
automated computer reservation system and several other technology-related 
assets. The technology-related write-offs were precipitated by the Company 
plans to enter several of the computer reservation systems owned and operated 
by third parties in an effort to increase its exposure and distribution to the 
flying public.
PASSENGER REVENUE
Passenger ticket sales are generally recorded as revenue when the 
transportation is provided. The Company fares are nonrefundable and changes 
in travel plans may be made only prior to scheduled departure for a $50 change 
fee, plus any increase to the new fare. The original fare plus any increase 
to the new fare for those passengers who cancel their flight in advance of the 
scheduled departure are accounted for as unused tickets as described below. 
The change fee is recognized as revenue when the change is made. Fares for 
passengers who do not cancel in advance of scheduled departure and do not take 
the scheduled flight are recognized as revenue when the scheduled flight 
departs. The value of unused tickets is included in current liabilities as 
air traffic liability, net of the Company estimates of what credits will be 
unused at the end of one year after the passenger cancels, at which time the 
credits are forfeited and recognized as revenue.
OTHER REVENUE
Other revenue includes cargo, mail and small package service revenue, all of 
which is recognized when the related service is provided. In addition, other 
revenue includes amounts earned by the Company in connection with its Air 
Logo program under which the Company makes available the exterior of its 
aircraft for advertising purposes. The Company recognized Air Logo revenues 
of approximately $1,288,000 and $649,000 for the years ended December 31, 1996 
and 1995, respectively.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company 
considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or 
less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Short-term restricted cash and cash equivalents consists of the balance of 
credit card receipts of approximately $8,315,000 and $8,350,000 at December 
31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, held by the Company credit card processing 
bank. Long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents consists of cash 
securing letters of credit required by the various airport authorities and the 
Department of Transportation see Note 11.
At December 31, 1996 and 1995, cash equivalents including $2,638,158 and 
$571,985 classified as restricted cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 
1996 and 1995, respectively consisting of United States government agencies' 
securities are classified as available for sale in accordance with Statement 
of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain 
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. At December 31, 1996 and 1995, the 
amortized cost, which approximated fair value, was approximately $8,711,000 
and $43,957,000, respectively.
ADVERTISING
The Company expenses the costs of advertising the first time the advertising 
takes place, except for direct-response advertising, which is capitalized and 
amortized over its expected period of future benefits.
Direct-response advertising consists primarily of specific programs offering 
promotional fares for a fixed period of time and for a fixed number of seats. 
The capitalized costs of the direct-response advertising are amortized over 
the period during which the passengers who purchased the promotional fares 
travel. Direct-response advertising capitalized at December 31, 1996 and 
1995, totaled $487,000 and $737,000, respectively.
MAINTENANCE RESERVES AND PREPAID MAINTENANCE
Routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred. Under the terms 
of its aircraft leases, the Company is required to make monthly maintenance 
reserve deposits based on aircraft usage. These deposits, which are to be 
applied against the cost of scheduled major maintenance checks and overhauls, 
are included as maintenance reserves in the accompanying consolidated 
financial statements until used for scheduled major maintenance checks and 
overhauls.
As scheduled major maintenance checks and overhauls are performed, the cost of 
such maintenance is capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method 
over the estimated periods benefited, which is to the next scheduled major 
maintenance check or overhaul or the life of the aircraft lease, whichever 
is shortest. These amounts are included as prepaid maintenance in the 
accompanying consolidated financial statements.
PASSENGER TRAFFIC COMMISSIONS AND RELATED FEES
Passenger traffic commissions and related fees are expensed when the 
transportation is provided and the related revenue is recognized. Passenger 
traffic commissions and other fees related to transportation not yet provided 
are included as a prepaid expense in the accompanying consolidated balance 
sheets.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization is 
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as 
follows   Leasehold improvements         Life of improvements
or term of lease,
whichever is less
Aircraft                      20 years
Airport concourse                  20 years
Ground equipment                 5-10 years

Furniture and fixtures                5 years
Office equipment                   3 years
AIRCRAFT AND ENGINE DEPOSITS
Included in aircraft and engine deposits are deposits for each of the 
Company leased aircraft, generally equal to two or three months rent. 
Deposits related to aircraft leased at December 31, 1996 and 1995, totaled 
$8,104,613 and $5,887,188, respectively. Any portion of the deposits not 
required to be applied to cure a default by the Company is to be returned to 
the Company at the termination of the lease.
As discussed in Note 12, the Company entered an agreement for the purchase of 
six Boeing 737-300, firm options for six Boeing 737-700 series aircraft and 
rolling options for up to six additional Boeing 737-700 series aircraft. A 
total of $112 million in deposits have been paid as of December 31, 1996, and 
are included in aircraft and engine deposits in the accompanying consolidated 
financial statements.
ACCRUED EXPENSES
The following amounts are included in accrued expenses as of December 31                            1996     1995
Federal excise taxes               $ 1,757,962 $ 3,311,671
Aircraft fuel and oil payable            3,099,605   2,331,486
Accrued maintenance reserves             1,537,025     -  
Accrued restructuring costs             1,661,856        OPERATING AND PREOPERATING EXPENSES
Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 1995, include preoperating 
and development costs of Western Pacific totaling approximately $48 million. 
Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 1996, include preoperating 
and development costs of MAX totaling approximately $27 million.
Preoperating and development costs for financial reporting purposes consist of 
all costs incurred prior to the commencement of scheduled flight operations. 
These costs, which were expensed when incurred, include obtaining the 
necessary government licenses, hiring personnel, assembling the management 
team and all other activities required to bring the entity to an operational 
stage.
LOSS PER COMMON SHARE AND COMMON SHARE EQUIVALENT
Loss per common share and common share equivalent is computed by dividing the 
net loss by the weighted average number of common shares and common share 
equivalents assumed outstanding during the period. For purposes of these 
calculations, the Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock that was 
converted into shares of common stock in connection with the Company initial 
public offering has been assumed to have been converted upon original 
issuance. Fully diluted earnings per share are equal to primary earnings per 
share in all periods presented.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT
SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-
Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, was adopted by the Company in fiscal 1996. 
The adoption did not have a material effect on the Company financial 
position or its results of operations.

During 1996, the Company constructed a passenger concourse at Colorado 
Springs Airport for the exclusive use of the Company. The concourse and 
related fixtures and equipment were completed during December of 1996 at a 
cost of approximately $41 million. The Company is also making certain 
improvements to the existing facilities at Colorado Springs Airport and will 
assist in the construction of a permanent connection between the existing 
facilities and the newly constructed concourse. The Company is in 
negotiations with the City of Colorado Springs the City to obtain 
reimbursement for the construction costs of the concourse through the issuance 
of special purpose facility bonds that would be guaranteed by the Company and 
secured by a lease for the newly constructed concourse. There is no assurance 
that the Company and the City will be successful in completing the special 
purpose facility bond transaction.
As discussed in Note 2, the Company initiated a restructuring plan in the 
fourth quarter of 1996. Software, telecommunication and computer equipment, 
and leasehold improvements of approximately $40 million was written off in 
connection with the restructuring plan.
4 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company estimates the fair value of its monetary assets and liabilities 
based upon existing interest rates related to such assets and liabilities 
compared to current rates of interest for instruments with a similar nature 
and degree of risk. The Company estimates that the carrying value of all of 
its monetary assets and liabilities approximates fair value as of December 31, 
1996 and 1995.
5 SHORT-TERM DEBT Short-term debt at December 31, 1996, consists of the following there was no 
short-term debt at December 31, 1995   Notes payable to stockholders, interest payable at 
825%, due January 17, 1997. These notes were 
converted into 50,000 shares of Series B Preferred 
Stock in February 1997, as discussed in Note 7.      $ 5,013,562
Note payable, due on July 30, 1997, interest payable 
at prime 825% at December 31, 1996 plus one percent,

agreement discussed in Note 12.               5,442,423
$ 10,455,985
6 LONG-TERM DEBT During 1996, the Company issued a $168 million note payable to a third party 
to finance the acquisition of an aircraft. The note accrues interest at 
104%, requires monthly principal and interest payments decreasing over the 
term of the loan from $215,000 to $122,402 and is secured by the aircraft. 
The balance outstanding at December 31, 1996 was $15,997,297. In the event 
the note payable is prepaid due to a sale of the aircraft or refinancing of 
the note, a prepayment premium of up to 3% of the then outstanding principal 
balance plus an amount to be calculated based on an agreed upon formula set 
forth in the note agreement is due to the note holder. The aggregate 
prepayment premium at December 31, 1996, is approximately $35 million. The 
note matures in April 2011. The Company is also party to certain capital 
lease agreements, which require monthly payments of approximately $4,100 
through November 2000. Capital lease obligations outstanding at December 31, 
1996 totaled $225,279. The future maturities of long-term debt and capital 
lease obligations are as follows       Year                Amount

7 STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY The Company authorized capital stock consists of 20,000,000 shares of common 
stock, par value $001 per share and 3,047,000 shares of serial preferred 
stock, par value $001 per share.
COMMON STOCK
On December 4, 1995, the Company completed an initial public offering in which 
3,220,000 shares of the Company common stock were sold to the public at a 
price of $19 per share. Of the 3,220,000 shares of common stock sold in the 
offering, 2,720,000 were sold by the Company with the remaining 500,000 being 
sold by certain stockholders of the Company.
SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK
During 1995 and 1994, the Company sold an aggregate of 3,046,769 shares of its 
Series A Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock Series A. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Series A, the Company had the option to convert 
the Series A into common stock on the effective date of an initial public 
offering of the Company common stock if such public offering was at a price 
of $8 per share or more and would generate gross proceeds of $20 million or 
more. In connection with its initial public offering on December 4, 1995, the 
Company converted all outstanding shares of Series A on a one-for-one basis 
into shares of common stock.
Discounts on increasing rate preferred stock are amortized over the periods 
preceding commencement of the stated dividend by charging an imputed dividend 
cost against accumulated deficit and increasing the carrying amount of the 
preferred stock through additional paid-in capital by a corresponding amount. 
For the period from inception to December 31, 1994, and for the period from 
January 1, 1995 through the conversion of the Series A, the Company amortized 
approximately $75,000 and $798,900, respectively, of the total discount on its 
Series A of approximately $1,703,000, the remainder of which has been 
reflected as an increase to additional paid-in capital in connection with the 
conversion of the Series A. The Series A was canceled during July 1996.
SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK
On January 31, 1997, the Board of Directors of Western Pacific authorized the 
designation of 200,000 shares of its preferred stock as Series B Preferred 
Stock Series B with a par value of $001 per share. In February 1997, 
Western Pacific completed the sale of all 200,000 shares of Series B for total 
proceeds of $20,000,000, which included the conversion of $50 million of 
notes payable issued in December 1996 see Note 5.
At any time after the three year anniversary of the issue date, the holders of 
Series B shall have the right to cause Western Pacific to redeem all or any 
part of Series B for an amount equal to the original issue price $100 per 
share plus all dividends accumulated and unpaid.
At any time after the three year anniversary of the issue date, the holders of 
Series B shall have the right to convert all or any portion of such Series B 
into an exchange note in the principal amount equal to the issue price plus an 
amount representing a ten percent 10% per annum return compounded annually 
on the issue price from the issue date.
The holders of Series B are entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized by 
the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for that purpose, 
quarterly cash dividends in an amount per share equal to $250 per annum. 
Such dividends shall begin to accumulate and shall be fully cumulative from 
the issue date, whether or not authorized by the Board of Directors and 
whether or not in any period there are funds of Western Pacific legally 
available for the payment of such dividends.
In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Western Pacific, 
whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or distribution of the 
assets of Western Pacific shall be made to or set apart for the holders of 
shares ranking junior to the Series B, holders of Series B shall be entitled 
to receive in immediately available funds an amount equal to the issue price 
per share, plus all dividends accumulated and unpaid thereon to the date of 
final distribution to such holders Liquidation Preference.
At any time after the issue date, the Series B may be redeemed by Western 
Pacific, at its option in whole or in part at any time, for an amount payable 
in immediately available funds equal to the Liquidation Preference on the date 
fixed for redemption.
In connection with the sale of the Series B, Western Pacific issued to the 
same parties, warrants to purchase up to 2,500,000 shares of Western Pacific 
common stock at a price of $01 per share. The ultimate number of warrants 
that will vest depends on the length of time that the Series B remains 
outstanding. The vesting schedule is as follows: i warrants for the 
purchase of 256,849 shares of common stock vested on the issue date of the 
Series B ii warrants for the purchase of 256,849 vest ratably from the issue 
date through December 1, 1997, as long as the Series B remains outstanding, 
iii warrants for the purchase of 856,161 shares of common stock vest ratably 
from May 1, 1998 through April 30, 1999, as long as the Series B remains 
outstanding, and iv warrants for the purchase of 1,130,138 shares of common 
stock vest ratably from May 1, 1999 through April 30, 2000, as long as the 
Series B remains outstanding.
The $20 million in gross proceeds received by Western Pacific will be 
allocated between the Series B and the warrants based on the respective fair 
values of each instrument, which is estimated at $107 million for the Series 
B and $93 million for the warrants. The initial carrying amount of the 
Series B will be increased by periodic accretions so that the carrying amount 
will equal the redemption amount $200 million at the redemption date in 
February 2000. The periodic increases in carrying amount will be affected by 
charges against additional paid-in capital.

exercise of the $8 Affinity Warrants Affinity Warrants granted to certain 
vendors and strategic partners of the Company. The Affinity Warrants are

8 STOCK PLANS   1994 STOCK OPTION PLAN
The Company adopted the 1994 Stock Option Plan the Plan which provides for 
the grant of options intended to qualify as incentive stock options and 
nonstatutory stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended the Code. Incentive stock options are

continuously associated with the Company from the date of grant to a date not 
less than 60 days prior to the date of exercise. Options under the Plan must 
be granted within 10 years from the effective date of the Plan. The exercise

ceasing to be employed by the Company become available for issuance.
There were 898,514 and 1,491,000 options available for grant as of December 
31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
DIRECTORS' STOCK OPTION PLAN
The Company 1995 Directors' Option Plan the Directors' Option Plan was 
adopted by the Board of Directors in June 1995. A total of 200,000 shares of 
common stock have been reserved for issuance under the Directors' Option Plan, 
which provides for the grant of nonstatutory stock options to outside 
directors of the Company. The Director Option Plan is designed to work 
automatically, without administration; however, to the extent administration 
is necessary, the Compensation Committee serve as administrators.
The terms of the Directors' Option Plan provide that each person who first 
becomes an outside director of the Company is automatically granted an option 
to purchase 25,000 shares upon the later of the date on which the optionee 
first becomes a director of the Company or July 28, 1995 the date on which 
the Board of Directors approved the Directors' Option Plan. The Directors' 
Option Plan is effective for ten years after its adoption by the Board of 
Directors. The term of each individual option is five years, and subject to 
limited exceptions for termination, disability and death, each option is 
exercisable only while the Outside Director remains a Director of the Company.
The exercise price of all options granted under the Directors' Option Plan is 
equal to the fair market value of a share of the Company common stock on the 
date of grant of the option. The options are exercisable in installments, to 
the extent of 40% of the shares 10,000 shares on the date of grant of the 
option, 30% of the shares 7,500 shares on the first anniversary of the date 
of the grant of the option and 30% of the shares 7,500 shares on the second 
anniversary of the date of grant of the option, provided, however, that no 
option was exercisable until June 1995.
Options to purchase 125,000 shares of common stock had been granted under the 
Directors' Option Plan as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, at prices ranging 
from $600 to $800 per share of which options to purchase 87,500 and 50,000 
shares, respectively, were exercisable. No options have been exercised.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
The Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan Purchase Plan was adopted by the 
Board of Directors in September 1995, as a qualified employee stock purchase 
plan under Section 423 of the Code, and became effective on the effective date 
of the Company initial public offering. The Company has reserved 600,000 
shares of common stock for issuance under the Purchase Plan, which allows 
eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock, at annual intervals, 
through periodic payroll deductions.
The purchase price per share is 85% of the lower of the fair market value of 
the common stock on the date of i commencement of an offering period or ii 
termination of an offering period. The purchase price, amount of shares 
purchased, and value of stock purchased are all subject to certain limitations 
on an individual and aggregate basis, as defined in the Purchase Plan. Under 
the Purchase Plan, 31,967 and 154,910 shares of common stock have been issued 
during 1996 and 1995, respectively.
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 123
During 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123, 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which defines a fair value based 
method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument 
and encourages all entities to adopt that method of accounting for all of 
their employee stock compensation plans. However, it also allows an entity to 
continue to measure compensation cost related to stock options issued to 
employees under these plans using the method of accounting prescribed by the 
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock 
Issued to Employees. Entities electing to remain with the accounting in APB 
No. 25 must make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share, 
as if the fair value based method of accounting defined in SFAS No. 123 has 
been applied.
The Company has elected to account for its stock-based compensation plans 
under APB No. 25; however, the Company has computed for pro forma disclosure 
purposes the value of all options and warrants granted during 1995 and 1996; 
using the following weighted average assumptions used for grants      Risk free interest rate          61%
Expected dividend yield           N/A
Expected lives             5 years
Expected volatility             61 Options were assumed to be exercised over the five year expected life for the 
purpose of this valuation. Adjustments are made for options forfeited prior 
to vesting. The total value of options and warrants granted was computed to 
be the following approximate amounts, which would be amortized on the 
straight-line basis over the vesting period of options and warrants      Year ended December 31, 1996    $ 3,640,000
Year ended December 31, 1995    $ 3,828,858
If the Company had accounted for stock options issued to employees using a 
fair value based method of accounting, the Company net loss and net loss per 
common share and common share equivalent would have been reported as follows:
Year Ended December 31,
1996     1995
Net loss:
As reported                 $23,718,750 $10,494,856
Pro forma                   25,715,544 11,794,677
Net loss per common share 
and common share equivalent:
As reported                  $ 178   $ 112
Pro forma                    193    126
The effects of applying SFAS No. 123 for providing pro forma disclosures for 
1996 and 1995 are not likely to be representative of the effects on reported 
net income loss and net income loss per common share and common share 
equivalent for future years, because options vest over several years and 
additional awards generally are made each year.
9 INCOME TAXES The Company computes its income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, 
Accounting for Income Taxes. SFAS No. 109 requires the use of an asset and 
liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial 
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates expected 
to be in effect when those differences reverse.
The provisions for income taxes at December 31 are as follows                     1996     1995     1994
Current:
Federal               $   -    $  -     $  38,962
State                   -      -        7,249
-      -       46,211
Deferred tax benefit          9,919,000  4,140,000   630,900
Increase in valuation allowance     9,919,000   4,140,000    584,689
Provision for income taxes      $   -    $  -     $  -
The components of deferred taxes at December 31 are as follows                            1996      1995
Capitalized organization and start-up costs    $ 2,977,000 $ 2,142,000

Valuation allowance                 14,644,000  4,725,000
$   -    $   -
A valuation allowance is provided when it is uncertain that some portion or 
all of the deferred tax asset will be recognized. The Company has established 
a valuation allowance due to the unprofitable operating history of the 
Company.
At December 31, 1996, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of 
approximately $20,897,000 expiring from 2010 through 2011.
Stock issuances by the Company may cause a change in ownership under the 
provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 382; accordingly, the utilization 
of the Company net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to annual 
limitations.
10 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Effective June 10, 1996, the Company entered into a short-term lease agreement 
with an affiliate of a director of the Company for two Boeing 727-200

performed, with minimum monthly compensation of $12,500. For the years ended 
December 31, 1996 and 1995, the Company paid approximately $34 million and 
$276,000, respectively, under these agreements. Both agreements were 
terminated in December 1996. The Company also purchased uniforms and other 
supplies from an affiliate of a shareholder and director of the Company. 
Purchases of $446,000 and $100,000 were made from this affiliate during the 
years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
On September 30, 1994, the Company entered into an Aircraft Supply Agreement 
the Agreement with Aircorp, Inc. Aircorp, an affiliate of a member of the 
Company board of directors. Under the Agreement, Aircorp acted as the

from Aircorp or any affiliated company for which no commission is due. 
Amounts paid under the agreement for aircraft leased during the year ended 
December 31, 1995 totaled $1,221,000. The agreement was terminated in October 
1995.
11 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   OPERATING LEASES

under operating leases with terms ranging from five to ten years. Rent 
expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. The 
amount charged to aircraft lease expense was approximately $38,363,000 and 
$13,223,000 for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. 
Under the terms of the aircraft leases, the Company is required to make

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company does not believe it is subject to any significant concentration of 
credit risk. At December 31, 1996, approximately 35% of the Company 
receivables related to amounts due from travel agencies and approximately 23% 
related to tickets sold to individual passengers through the use of major 
credit cards. These receivables are short-term, generally being settled 
shortly after the sale or in the month following usage. Bad debt losses, 
which have been minimal to date, have been considered in establishing 
allowances for uncollectible accounts.
LEASE LINE OF CREDIT
In May 1996, the Company obtained a $50 million credit facility from a 
technology equipment lessor for the financing of computer hardware and 
software. The facility carries an initial term of one year and provides 
financing for 100% of the technology acquisition cost. As purchases are made, 
advances under the facility are converted to separate operating lease 
agreements. The facility remains in effect so long as there is not a material 
adverse change in the credit rating of the Company during the term of the 
agreement. At December 31, 1996, the Company had used approximately $650,000 
of this credit facility and approximately $4,350,000 was available for 
additional acquisitions.
COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS
The Company has entered into employment agreements with certain members of 
senior management, which have three year terms and generally include 
provisions for medical, life and disability insurance, automobile allowances 
and the granting of stock options under the 1994 Stock Option Plan. The 
employment agreement with its president and chief executive officer also 
included a stock grant and signing bonus. Approximately $558,000 of 
compensation expense, representing the signing bonus and the value of the 
vested shares of common stock granted was recorded pursuant to this agreement 
for the year ended December 31, 1996.
OTHER
The Company is a party to various legal and administrative proceedings arising 
in the ordinary course of business. Management believes, based upon 
discussion with legal counsel, that the eventual outcome of these proceedings 
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company financial position, 
results of operations or liquidity.
During 1996, the Company entered into a letter of intent with the owner of an 
aircraft for the proposed purchase of that aircraft. The Company decided not 
to purchase this aircraft and therefore, the owner of the aircraft has 
notified the Company that they intend to seek damages equal to the difference 
between the agreed upon purchase price and the ultimate sales price of the 
aircraft. Management of the Company believes the Company has no liability and 
have therefore, not provided any reserves for such resolution.
As required by the various airport authorities, the Company has outstanding 
letters of credit at December 31, 1996 and 1995, in the amount of 
approximately $1,069,000 and $485,000, respectively, secured by restricted 
cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, Western Pacific has issued a $15 
million irrevocable letter of credit in favor of MAX to satisfy certain 
Department of Transportation requirements.
12 SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS The Company has entered into a ten-year contract with the Aerospace division 
of BF Goodrich Aerospace BFG for comprehensive aircraft maintenance 
services. These services include heavy airframe maintenance, component 
overhaul/repair, wheel and brake services, landing gear overhaul, technical 
engineering and various maintenance support services and spare parts inventory 
purchasing, financing and warehousing. BFG maintains a comprehensive aircraft 
spare parts inventory for the Company exclusive use in a Colorado Springs 
warehouse that is staffed, equipped and managed by BFG.
Charges for heavy airframe maintenance and component overhaul/repair services 
are based on BFG customary rates; while fees for wheel and brake services 
are paid on a cost per landing basis and landing gear overhaul is on a fixed 
charge per overhaul basis. The Company also pays BFG a monthly inventory 
standby fee based upon the value of rotable/repairable spare parts inventory 
on hand at the end of each month while expendable and consumable supplies are 
paid for by the Company as used. Additionally, BFG receives a monthly program 
management fee to cover the cost of providing aircraft engineering and 
maintenance services and for providing aircraft spare parts purchasing and 
warehousing services. Such fees are expensed as incurred. Under the 
contract, BFG received $300,000 as reimbursement for program start-up expenses 
and 200,000 shares of common stock valued at $6 per share as consideration for 
the first three years of program management fees. The start-up fee was 
primarily for the purchase of fixed assets to be used by BFG during the term 
of the agreement. The fair value of the common stock issued in consideration 
for the program management fees is reflected in stockholders' equity as common 
stock and deferred compensation, and is being amortized over the term of the 
agreement.
In October 1996, the Company entered into an agreement with Boeing for the 
purchase of six new Boeing 737-300 aircraft. The total purchase price for 
these aircraft will be approximately $232 million. Under the terms of the 
contract, five of the 737-300 aircraft are scheduled to be delivered during 
1997 and one is scheduled to be delivered in 1998. The acquisition cost is 
subject to increase by an inflationary factor, as defined in the agreement. 
The Company is obligated to prepay, pursuant to a prepayment schedule, 
approximately 15% of the cost of these aircraft before delivery occurs. The 
prepaid amounts have been recorded as aircraft and engine deposits in the 
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. During 1996, the Company also 
accrued $1,390,000 in interest for prepayments not made in accordance with the 
agreed upon funding schedule. The accrued interest is included in accrued 
expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The Company has also entered into an agreement with Boeing whereby the Company 
was granted an option to purchase six new Boeing 737-700 aircraft. The 
agreement provides for the delivery of the aircraft, if the option is 
exercised, starting in 2000. If options on all six aircraft are exercised, 
the total purchase price will be approximately $265 million. The Company paid 
$12 million to Boeing during 1996 to secure this option, which has been 
recorded as aircraft and engine deposits in the accompanying consolidated 
balance sheets. The Company also has a rolling option for the purchase of six 
additional Boeing 737-700 aircraft.
The Company has entered into a financing facility with a third party to 
provide funding for certain of the prepayments required under the Boeing 
agreement. The financing facility requires the payment of a 2% fee up-front 
and interest at prime plus one percent. At December 31, 1996, there was 
$5,442,423 outstanding under the facility see Note 5. All amounts are due 
upon the earlier of July 30, 1997 or when the first aircraft is delivered. 
Through this and other sources, the Company intends to obtain lease financing 
for all aircraft acquired pursuant to the agreements with Boeing.
In September 1996, Western Pacific entered into an alliance agreement the 
Alliance Agreement with MAX. Under the Alliance Agreement, Western Pacific 
is to provide essential services on behalf of MAX including reservation, 
ticketless booking and sales, purchasing, marketing, flight planning, flight 
data and weather data services in exchange for a per passenger charge. 
Western Pacific creates and coordinates all of MAX advertising, marketing 
and promotional programs. Western Pacific has no continuing obligation to 
fund the operation of MAX pursuant to the Alliance Agreement. The Alliance 
Agreement expires in 2006, but is subject to earlier termination in certain 
circumstances.
Effective April 1, 1997 Effective Date, the Company entered into a 
Information Technology Services Agreement Technology Agreement with Perot 
Systems Corporation Perot pursuant to which Perot will deliver an integrated 
suite of technology related services to the Company over a five year period in 
support of the Company strategic plan. These services are to include 
business process re-engineering, call center infrastructure, data mining, 
networking, total system management and the application of emerging 
technologies. Base monthly service fees under the Technology Agreement, which 
excludes pass-through expenses for which Perot will be reimbursed by the 
Company, are as follows        Months            Monthly Fee
1-12             $317,000
13-24             461,600
25-36             981,800
37-48             975,500
49-60             934,400
During the first six months of the Technology Agreement, the Company can elect 
to issue shares of its common stock in lieu of cash for up to three months of 
base monthly service fees and pass-through expenses not to exceed $20 
million. The number of shares to be issued is to be determined by dividing 
the amount of the base monthly service fees by the average closing bid price 
for the Company common stock for the five trading days ending two days prior 
to the date the shares are to be delivered. If Perot decides to sell the 
shares of common stock within thirty calendar days after receiving such 
shares or is unable to sell the shares for specified reasons, Perot can 
require the Company to pay an amount equal to the excess of the applicable 
monthly base service fees over the actual proceeds from such sale and will 
return any unsold shares to the Company. This option is available to Perot 
only during the thirty days following the issuance of the shares. As additional consideration under the Technology Agreement, the Company will 
pay Perot, in the form of shares of its common stock, $800,000 within thirty 
days of the Effective Date, $600,000 on the first anniversary of the Effective 
Date and $400,000 on the second anniversary of the Effective Date. The number 
of shares to be issued will be determined in the manner described above. The 
Company has an option, exercisable at any time prior to the termination or 
expiration of the Technology Agreement, to repurchase, at a price of $1500 
per share, any of these shares which have not been sold by Perot. 13 SEGMENT DATA The Company provides low cost, low fare airline service through Western
