Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The financial statements begin on the following page.                    13              INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT The Board of Directors and Shareholders
CIBER, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CIBER, Inc. 
and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1996 and 1995, and the related consolidated 
statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of 
the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 1996. These consolidated 
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial 
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CIBER, 
Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1996 and 1995, and the results of their 
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year 
period ended June 30, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles.                KPMG PEAT MARWICK LLP Denver, Colorado

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 1994, 1995 AND 1996
1 NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a NATURE OF OPERATIONS
CIBER, Inc. CIBER or the Company is a nationwide provider of 
information technology consulting services. Through its approximately 2,000 
consultants operating out of over 30 branch offices in over 20 states, plus 
one office in each of two foreign countries, CIBER offers services to its 
clients in three principal areas: information technology consulting services, 
package software implementation services and millennium date conversion 
services. The CIBER Information Services division provides application 
software staff supplementation, system life-cycle project responsibility and 
other computer-related professional services primarily to large corporate 
clients. Package software implementation services are provided by the 
Company wholly-owned subsidiary, Business Information Technology, Inc. 
BIT, which specializes in the implementation and integration of human 
resource and financial software application products, primarily for 
client/server networks. The Company CIBR2000 division offers services to 
help clients correct computer systems for the year 2000 date change.
In May 1996, Practical Business Solutions, Inc. PBSI, which provided 
consulting services similar to CIBER, merged with CIBER. The merger has been 
accounted for as a pooling of interests, and accordingly, the Company 
financial statements have been restated for all periods prior to the business 
combination to include the results of operations, financial position and cash 
flows of PBSI.
b PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and 
its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and 
transactions have been eliminated. 
c CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an 
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash 
equivalents consist of money market funds.
d PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment, which consists primarily of office equipment and 
furniture, is stated at cost. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to 
expense. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line and accelerated 
methods over the estimated useful lives, ranging primarily from five to seven 
years. Depreciation expense was $294,000, $471,000 and $704,000 for the 
years ended June 30, 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively. 
e INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets consist of client lists, goodwill, noncompete agreements 
and software license costs. Client lists are amortized over the estimated 
useful lives ranging from two to eight years. Goodwill is amortized over 12 
to 15 years. Noncompete agreements and software license costs are amortized 
over the terms of the contracts which range from two to eight years. 
Amortization is recorded using the straight-line method.                    19              CIBER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
Intangible assets will be reviewed for impairment when events indicate the 
carrying amount of intangible assets may not be recoverable. Events that may 
indicate a need to assess recoverability include significant changes in 
business conditions, continuing losses or a forecasted inability to achieve 
at least break-even operating results over a long period. Management does not 
believe current events or circumstances provide evidence that intangible 
assets have been impaired. Impairments would be considered to exist when the 
estimated non-discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of 
the intangible asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset. 
Impairment, if any, will be measured based on forecasted future discounted 
operating cash flows. 
f REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue on contracts as services are rendered. 
Revenues include reimbursable expenses directly incurred in providing 
services to clients. Reimbursable expenses totaled $2,368,000, $3,896,000 and 
$4,610,000 for the years ended June 30, 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively.  
Revenues also include pass-through billings of third parties performed as an 
accommodation to certain clients; these represented approximately $458,000, 
$639,000 and $3,553,000 for the years ended June 30, 1994, 1995 and 1996, 
respectively.
g INCOME TAXES
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax 
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement 
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax 
basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax 
rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those 
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A tax benefit 
or expense is recognized for the net change in the deferred tax asset or 
liability during the period. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period 
that includes the enactment date. 
Prior to their merger with the Company, PBSI and Spencer & Spencer Systems, 
Inc. SSSI each had elected S corporation status for U.S. federal income 
tax purposes; therefore, the tax liability associated with their income was 
the responsibility of their stockholders. Accordingly, no provision for 
income taxes is included in the historical consolidated financial statements 
for the operations of these companies prior to their merger with CIBER. The 
related net deferred tax liability at the merger date has been recorded as 
income tax expense. See note 1j. 
h STOCK SPLIT
The Company Board of Directors authorized a two-for-one stock split 
effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend payable on June 14, 1996, to 
shareholders of record on May 31, 1996. As a result of the stock split an 
additional 8,468,000 common shares were issued. Shareholders' equity has 
been restated to give retroactive recognition to the stock split for all 
periods presented by reclassifying from additional paid in capital to common 
stock the par value of the additional shares arising from the split. In 
addition, all references in the consolidated financial statements to number 
of common shares, per share amounts and stock option data have been restated.
i STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
CIBER uses the intrinsic value-based method for measuring stock-based 
compensation cost which measures compensation cost as the excess, if any, of 
the quoted market price of CIBER common stock at the grant date over the 
amount the employee must pay for the stock. CIBER generally grants stock 
options at fair market value at the date of grant.                    20              CIBER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
j PRO FORMA NET INCOME
To properly reflect the Company pro forma net income, the net income of 
PBSI and SSSI has been tax effected and are included in the pro forma 
adjustment to income tax expense in the accompanying consolidated statements 
of operations for all periods prior to their merger with CIBER. This 
adjustment was computed as if PBSI and SSSI had been taxable entities subject 
to federal and state income taxes prior to their merger with CIBER at the 
marginal rates applicable in such periods. In addition, the pro forma 
adjustment to income tax expense for the years ended June 30, 1995 and 1996 
has been effected to exclude $284,000 and $475,000, respectively, 
representing the one-time income tax expense resulting from the termination 
of the S corporation status of SSSI and PBSI, respectively.
k PRO FORMA INCOME PER COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARE
Pro forma income per common and common equivalent share is computed on the 
basis of weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year and 
common equivalent shares. Common equivalent shares of 1,906,000, 1,806,000 
and 1,561,000 in fiscal 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively, consist of stock 
options, determined using the treasury stock method. Pursuant to the 
Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin, common and 
common equivalent shares issued during the twelve-month period prior to the 
Company initial public offering in March 1994 at prices less than the 
initial public offering price have been included in the calculation as if 
they were outstanding for all periods prior to the initial public offering 
using the treasury stock method and the initial public offering price. In 
addition, the shares and the options issued in fiscal 1995 and 1996 in 
connection with the poolings of interests discussed in note 2, have been 
treated as if they had been issued and outstanding for all periods prior to 
the respective merger. 
l ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of 
contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
m FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Unless otherwise stated, herein, the fair value of the Company financial 
instruments approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short 
periods to maturity of the instruments and/or variable interest rates of the 
instruments which approximate current market rates. 
2 POOLINGS OF INTERESTS
In May 1996, the Company issued 959,035 shares of its common stock and stock 
options to purchase 72,185 shares of common stock at $001 per share in 
exchange for the assets and the assumption of the liabilities of PBSI by 
CIBER. The CIBER stock options granted replaced existing PBSI stock options. 
The merger has been accounted for as a pooling of interests and, accordingly, 
the Company consolidated financial statements have been restated for all 
periods prior to the merger to include the accounts and operations of PBSI 
with those of the Company. For income tax purposes, the merger was a 
nontaxable transaction.                    21             CIBER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

5 BANK REVOLVING LINES OF CREDIT
The Company has a revolving line of credit agreement with a bank providing for
outstanding borrowings of up to 80% of eligible accounts receivable with a
maximum borrowing of $15,000,000. Outstanding borrowings bear interest at the
bank prime rate 825% at June 30, 1996. Borrowings under the agreement are
collateralized by substantially all the assets of the Company. The credit
agreement requires a commitment fee of 0225% per annum on any unused portion. 
The terms and conditions of the credit agreement include several covenants,
including those whereby the Company agrees to the maintenance of a certain
tangible net worth and debt service coverage ratios and imposes limits on the
incurrence of additional indebtedness. Amounts advanced under the line of credit
can be used to consummate an acquisition and may be required by the bank to be
converted into a five-year term note payable in equal amounts of interest and
principal; in such event, the line of credit would be reduced by the amount of
the term note. 
Prior to its merger with the Company, BIT had a revolving line of credit with 
a bank. At June 30, 1995, $2,000,000 was outstanding. In July 1995, the 
Company canceled this line of credit and amounts outstanding were paid off 
utilizing borrowings under the Company line of credit described above.

The Company is a guarantor on a $2,000,000 inventory purchase line of credit 
with AT Capital Corporation to CIBER Network Services, Inc. CNSI, a 
company that is majority owned by certain officers of the Company. As of
