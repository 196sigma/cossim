Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Salem Communications Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Salem Communications Corporation and subsidiaries collectively, the Company as of December31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three
years ended December31, 2012. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule of the Company listed in a. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Salem Communications Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years ended December31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. SingerLewak LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Salem Communications Corporation Salem we or the company include the company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Description of Business 
Salem is a domestic multi-media company with integrated business operations covering radio broadcasting, publishing
and the Internet. Our programming is intended for audiences interested in Christian and conservative opinion content and complementary programming. Our primary business is the ownership and operation of radio stations in large metropolitan markets.
Upon the close of all announced transactions, we will own and/or operate 99 radio stations across the United States. We also own and operate Salem Radio Network SRN, SRN News Network SNN, Salem Music Network SMN, Solid Gospel Network SGN, Salem Media Representatives
SMR and Vista Media Representatives VMR. SRN, SNN, SMN and SGN are radio networks that produce and distribute programming, such as talk, news and music segments to radio stations throughout the United States, including
Salem owned and operated stations. SMR and VMR sell commercial airtime to national advertisers on radio stations and networks that we own, as well as on independent radio station affiliates. 
We also operate Salem Web Network SWN, our Internet businesses that provide Christian and
conservative-themed content, audio and video streaming, and other resources on the web. SWNs Internet portals include OnePlace.com, Christianity.com, Crosswalk.com, BibleStudyTools.com, GodTube.com, Townhall.com, HotAir.com, WorshipHouseMedia.com, SermonSpice.com, GodVine.com and Jesus.org. SWNs content is also
accessible through our radio station websites that feature content of interest to local listeners throughout the United States. SWN operates our radio station websites and Salem Consumer Products, a website offering books, DVDs and editorial
content developed by many of our on-air radio personalities that are available for purchase. The revenues generated from this segment are reported as Internet revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
We also operate Salem Publishing, that produces and distributes Christian and conservative opinion print magazines. Salem
Publishing includes Xulon Press, a print-on-demand self-publishing service for Christian authors. The revenues generated from this segment are reported as publishing revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
We consider all highly liquid debt instruments, purchased with an initial maturity of three-months or less, to be cash equivalents. The
carrying value of our cash equivalents approximated fair value at each balance sheet date. Restricted Cash 
Restricted cash includes amounts that are contractually restricted in connection with a security agreement between the company and
Travelers Insurance. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. An analysis is performed by applying various percentages based on
the age of the receivable and other subjective and historical analysis. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of ultimate realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer.
If the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. 
70 Table of Contents
Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the service has been rendered, the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collection of the
arrangement fee is reasonably assured. Revenues from radio programs and commercial advertising are recognized when the
program or advertisement is broadcast. Revenue is reported net of agency commissions, which are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing. Our customers principally include not-for-profit charitable organizations and
commercial advertisers. Revenue from the sale of products and services is recognized when the products are shipped and the services are rendered. Revenues from the sale of advertising in our magazines is recognized upon publication. Revenue from the
sale of subscriptions to our publications is recognized over the life of the subscription. Revenue from book sales is recorded when shipment occurs. Multiple-Deliverables We may enter bundled advertising agreements that include
spot advertisements on our radio stations, Internet banner placements, print magazine advertisements and booth space at specific events or some combination thereof. The multiple deliverables contained in each agreement are accounted for separately
over their respective delivery period provided that they are separate units of accounting. The selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence if available or estimated selling price if vendor specific
objective evidence is not available. Objective evidence of fair value includes the price charged for each element when it is sold separately. The estimated selling price is the price that we would transact if the deliverable was sold regularly on a
standalone basis. Arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of each arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. The relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionally to
each deliverable on the basis of each deliverables selling price. Barter Transactions 
We may provide advertising time in exchange for certain products, supplies and services. The terms of the exchanges generally permit for
the preemption of such broadcast time in favor of advertisers who purchase time on regular terms. We include the value of such exchanges in both net broadcasting revenues and broadcast operating expenses. The value recorded for barter revenues is
based upon managements estimate of the fair value of the products, supplies and services received. Advertising time
that our radio stations exchange for goods and or services is recorded as barter revenue when the advertisement is broadcast at an amount equal to our estimate fair value of what was received. The value of goods or services received in such barter
transactions is charged to expense as used. Barter advertising revenue included in broadcast revenue for the years ended December31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 was approximately $46 million, $52 million and $53 million, respectively, and barter
expenses were approximately the same as barter revenue for each period. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 
The company has one employee stock compensation plan, described more fully in Note 11. Stock Option Plan. We account for
stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 718 CompensationStock Compensation. We record equity
awards under the fair value method with share-based compensation measured at the fair value of the award as of the grant date. The exercise price for options is equal to the closing market price of Salem Communications common stock on the date of
grant. We use the straight-line attribution method to recognize share-based compensation costs over the service period of the
award. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of restricted stock awards, deferred tax assets for options and restricted stock awards with multiple vesting dates are eliminated for each
vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period was a separate award. To calculate the excess tax benefits available as of the date of adoption for use in offsetting future tax shortfalls, we followed the alternative
transition method discussed in the FASB ASC Topic 718. 
71 Table of Contents
Accounting for Acquisitions and Upgrades of Radio Station and Network Assets 
A majority of our radio station acquisitions have consisted primarily of the FCC licenses to broadcast in a particular market. We often do
not acquire the existing format, or we change the format upon acquisition when we find it beneficial. As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price for the assets of a radio station is allocated to the broadcast license. It is our policy
generally to retain third-party appraisers to value radio stations, networks, Internet or publishing properties. The allocations assigned to acquired broadcast licenses and other assets are subjective by their nature and require our careful
consideration and judgment. We believe the allocations represent appropriate estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired. As part of the valuation and appraisal process, the third-party appraisers prepare reports that assign values to the
various asset categories in our financial statements. Our management reviews these reports and determines the reasonableness of the assigned values used to record the acquisition at the close of the transaction. 
We undertake projects from time to time to upgrade our radio station technical facilities and/or FCC broadcast licenses. Our policy is to
capitalize costs incurred up to the point where the project is complete, at which time we transfer the costs to the appropriate fixed asset and/or intangible asset categories. When the completion of a project is contingent upon FCC or other
regulatory approval, we assess the probable future benefit of the asset at the time that it is recorded and monitor it through the FCC or other regulatory approval process. In the event the required approval is not considered probable or the project
is abandoned, we write-off the capitalized costs of the project. Accounting for Discontinued Operations 
We regularly review underperforming assets to determine if a sale might be a better way to monetize the assets. When a station, group of
stations, or other asset groups are considered for sale, we review the transaction to determine if or when the entity qualifies as a discontinued operation in accordance with the criteria of FASB ASC Topic 205-20 Discontinued Operations.
This pronouncement specifies that the operations and cash flow of the entity disposed of, or to be sold, have or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations as a result of the disposal and that we will not have significant continuing involvement
in the operations after the disposal transaction. For our radio stations, we define a cluster as a group of radio stations operating in the same geographic market, sharing the same building and equipment and managed by a single general manager. The
cluster level is the lowest level for which discrete financial information and cash flows are available and the level reviewed by management to analyze operating results. General Managers are compensated based on the results of their cluster as a
whole, not the results of any individual radio stations. We have determined that a radio market qualifies for a discontinued operation when management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the asset disposal group,
the sale is probable, and the sale will result in the exit of a particular geographic market. Based on operating results that
did not meet expectations, we ceased operating Samaritan Fundraising as of December31, 2011. Samaritan Fundraising, previously included in our Internet operations, was a web-based fundraising products company that operated from a single
facility in Fairfax, VA, under the control of one general manager. As a result of our decision to cease operations, the cash flows associated with this entity ceased and we have no continuing involvement in the operations of the entity. We have
reported the operating results and net assets of this entity as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. The
markets and entities that we have accounted for as a discontinued operation are explained in more fully in Note 3 Significant Transactions. Accounting for Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment
are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost represents the historical cost of acquiring the asset, including the costs necessarily incurred to bring it to the condition and location necessary for its intended use. For assets constructed
for our own use, such as towers and buildings that are discrete projects for which costs are separately accumulated and for which construction takes considerable time, we record capitalized interest. The amount capitalized is the cost that could
have been avoided had the asset not been constructed and is based on the average accumulated expenditures incurred over the capitalization period at the weighted average rate applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt. We capitalized interest
of $01 million during the years ended December31, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Improvements are capitalized when they extend the life of the asset or enhance the quality or
ability of the asset to benefit operations. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows:

The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is evaluated periodically in relation to the
operating performance and anticipated future cash flows of the underlying radio stations and businesses for indicators of impairment. When indicators of impairment are present and the cash flows estimated to be generated from these assets is less
than the carrying value of these assets, an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the fair market value of the assets is recorded, if necessary. No adjustments to the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment were made during the years
ended December31, 2010 and 2011. During June 2012, based on changes in managements planned usage, land in Covina,
CA was classified as held for sale and evaluated for impairment as of that date. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for impairment of long-lived assets held for sale, we determined the carrying value of the land exceeded the estimated
fair value less cost to sell. We recorded an impairment charge of $56 million associated with this land based on the estimated sale price. In December 2012, after several purchase offers for the land were terminated, we obtained a third party
valuation for the land. Based on this fair value appraisal, we recorded an additional $12 million impairment charge associated with the land. The table below presents the fair value measurements used to value this asset.  Fair Value Measurements Using Dollars in thousands Description

Accounting for Internally Developed Software and Website Development Costs 
We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of internal-use software as specified in
FASB ASC Topic 350-40 Internal-Use Software. Capitalized costs are generally amortized over the estimated useful life of three years. Costs incurred related to the conceptual design and maintenance of internal-use software are expensed
as incurred. Website development activities include planning, design and development of graphics and content for new websites and operation of existing sites. Costs incurred that involve providing additional functions and features to the website are
capitalized. Costs associated with website planning, maintenance, content development and training are expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs are generally amortized over the estimated useful life of three years. We capitalized $27 million, $23
million and $23 million during the years ended December31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, related to internally developed software and website development costs. Amortization expense of amounts capitalized was $14 million, $18 million
and $21 million for the years ended December31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Accounting for Advertising and Promotional Cost
Costs of media advertising and associated production costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to approximately $86
million, $103 million and $105 million for each of the years ending December31, 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively. Accounting for
Amortizable Intangible Assets Intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization. Typically, intangible
assets are acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of radio stations, Internet businesses and publishing entities. These intangibles are amortized using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

The carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets are evaluated periodically in relation to the
operating performance and anticipated future cash flows of the underlying radio stations and businesses for indicators of impairment. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360 Property, Plant and Equipment, when indicators of impairment are
present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated from these assets are less than the carrying amounts of these assets, an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the fair market value of these assets is recorded, if necessary. No
adjustments to the carrying amounts of our amortizable intangible assets were necessary during the years ended December31, 2010, 2011 or 2012. Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Approximately 71% of
our total assets as of December31, 2012, consist of indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as broadcast licenses, goodwill and mastheads, the value of which depends significantly upon the operating results of our businesses. In the case of
our radio stations, we would not be able to operate the properties without the related FCC license for each property. Broadcast licenses are renewed with the FCC every eight years for a nominal cost that is expensed as incurred. We continually
monitor our stations compliance with the various regulatory requirements. Historically, all of our broadcast licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective periods, and we expect that all broadcast licenses will continue to be
renewed in the future. Accordingly, we consider our broadcast licenses to be indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. Broadcast licenses account for approximately
94% of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and magazine mastheads account for the remaining 6%. We do not amortize goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets, but rather test for impairment at least annually or more frequently
if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. We complete our annual impairment tests in the fourth
quarter of each year. We believe that our estimate of the value of our broadcast licenses, mastheads, and goodwill is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets, and our estimates incorporate variables
and assumptions that are based on past experiences and judgment about future operating performance of our markets and business segments. The fair value measurements for our indefinite-lived intangible assets use significant unobservable inputs that
reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value including assumptions about risk. The unobservable inputs are defined in FASB ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures as Level 3 inputs discussed in detail in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Please refer to Note 2 Impairment of Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for a further discussion of our
testing plan and impairments recognized. Gain or Loss on Disposal of Assets 
We record gains or losses on the disposal of assets equal to the proceeds, if any, compared to the net book value. Exchange transactions
are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 845 Non-Monetary Transactions. For the year ended December31, 2010, we recorded a loss on disposal of assets of $03 million which includes a $02 million pre-tax loss pending the
sale of WAMD-AM, Aberdeen, Maryland, that closed on March1, 2011, a $02 million loss on a related party real estate transaction and $02 million of losses related to various other fixed assets and equipment disposals offset by a $03 million
pre-tax gain associated with the seizure of our property by the Dallas County School District. For the year ended December31, 2011, we recorded a gain on disposal of assets of $42 million that includes a $24 million pre-tax gain on the sale
of KKMO-AM in Seattle, Washington and a $21 million pre-tax gain on the sale of KXMX-AM in Los Angeles, California, offset by various fixed asset and equipment disposals. For the year ended December31, 2012, we recorded a $02 million pre-tax
gain on the sale of WBZS-AM in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and a $06 million gain from insurance proceeds for repairs of storm damage in our New York market , partially offset by various fixed asset and equipment disposals including an additional loss
associated with the write-off of a receivable from a prior station sale. Leases 
We lease various facilities including broadcast tower and transmitter sites. When we enter a lease agreement, we review the terms to
determine the appropriate classification of the lease as a capital lease or operating lease based on the factors listed in FASB ASC Topic 840 Leases. Our current lease terms generally range from one to twenty-five years with rent expense
recorded on a 
74 Table of Contents
straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes. We also sublease towers that we own under various agreements with other broadcasters. Subleases generally cover a sixty-year term, over which
time we recognize rental income on a straight-line basis. Deferred rent revenue was $47 million and $46 million at December31, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Leasehold Improvements We may elect to construct or otherwise invest in
leasehold improvements to properties. We capitalize the cost of the improvements that are then amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the remaining lease term. Deferred Financing Costs Deferred financing costs
consist of bond issue costs and bank loan fees. Bond issue costs represent costs incurred in conjunction with the issuance of the 95/8% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes on December1, 2009
95/8% Notes. The costs are being amortized over the term of the
95/
8% Notes as an adjustment to interest expense. Bank loan fees represent costs incurred with the Senior Credit Facility,
which is a revolving credit facility Revolver entered on December1, 2009. The costs are being amortized over the three-year term of the Revolver as an adjustment to interest expense. During the year ended December31, 2010,
approximately $07 million of bond issue costs were written off in conjunction with the early redemption of $300 million of the 95/8% Notes. During the year ended December31, 2011, approximately $01 million of bond issue costs were written off upon
the calling and retirement of the 95/8% Notes. During the year ended December31, 2012, approximately $03
million of bond issue costs were written off upon the calling and retirement of the 95/8% Notes.
Deferred financing costs consist of the following:  AsofDecember31,2011 AsofDecember31,2012 Dollars in thousands Bond issue costs 4,219 3,060 Bank loan fees 1,270 942 
5,489 4,002 
Partial Self-Insurance on Employee Health Plan 
We provide health insurance benefits to eligible employees under a self-insured plan whereby the company pays actual medical claims
subject to certain stop loss limits. We record self-insurance liabilities based on actual claims filed and an estimate of those claims incurred but not reported. Any projection of losses concerning our liability is subject to a high degree of
variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors such as future inflation rates, changes in severity, benefit level changes, medical costs and claim settlement patterns. Should the actual amount of claims increase
or decrease beyond what was anticipated, we may adjust our future reserves. Our self-insurance liability was $06 million at December31, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Local Programming and Marketing Agreement Fees We may enter into a Local
Marketing Agreement LMA or Time Brokerage Agreement TBA in connection with acquisitions of radio stations that are pending FCC regulatory approval of transfer of the broadcast licenses. Under the terms of these
agreements, we make specified periodic payments to the owner in exchange for the right to program and sell advertising for a specified portion of the stations inventory of broadcast time. We record revenues and expenses associated with the
portion of the stations inventory of broadcast time it manages. Nevertheless, as the holder of the FCC license, the owner-operator retains control and responsibility for the operation of the station, including responsibility over all
programming broadcast on the station. We also enter into LMAs in connection with dispositions of radio stations. In such cases, we may receive periodic payments in exchange for allowing the buyer to program and sell advertising for a portion
of the stations inventory of broadcast time. Derivative Instruments 
We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. We actively monitor these fluctuations and use derivative instruments from time to time
to manage the related risk. In accordance with our risk management strategy, we may use derivative instruments only for the purpose of managing risk associated with an asset, liability, committed transaction, or probable forecasted transaction that
is identified by management. Our use of derivative instruments may result in short-term gains or losses that may increase the volatility of our earnings. 
75 Table of Contents
Under FASB ASC Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging the effective portion of the
gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument shall be reported as a component of other comprehensive income outside earnings and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during
which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, shall be recognized currently in earnings. Fair Value Accounting FASB ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures established a single definition of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expanded disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. The provision applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or
permit fair value measurements. We adopted the fair value provisions for financial assets and financial liabilities effective January1, 2008. The adoption had a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and
cash flows. We adopted fair value provisions for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities effective January1, 2009. This includes applying the fair value concept to inonfinancial assets and liabilities initially measured at
fair value in business combinations; iireporting units or nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in conjunction with goodwill impairment testing; iiiother nonfinancial assets measured at fair value in conjunction
with impairment assessments; and ivasset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value. The adoption of the fair value provisions of FASB ASC Topic 820 to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities did not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The fair value provisions include
guidance on how to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities in the current economic environment and reemphasizes that the objective of a fair value measurement remains an exit price. If we were to conclude that there has been a significant
decrease in the volume and level of activity of the asset or liability in relation to normal market activities, quoted market values may not be representative of fair value and we may conclude that a change in valuation technique or the use of
multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate. The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial
instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Pricing observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market, and the
characteristics specific to the transaction. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a
lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have less or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Please
refer to Note 7 Fair Value Accounting for a further discussion. Long-term Debt and Debt Covenant Compliance 
Our classification of borrowings under our Revolver as long-term debt on our balance sheet is based on our assessment that, under the
terms of our Credit Agreement and after considering our projected operating results and cash flows for the coming year, no principal payments are required to be made. These projections are estimates dependent upon a number of factors including
developments in the markets in which we are operating in and economic and political factors, among other factors. Accordingly, these projections are inherently uncertain and our actual results could differ from these estimates. 
Income taxes and uncertain tax positions We account for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes.Upon the adoption of the provisions on January1, 2007, we had $30 million in liabilities related to
uncertain tax positions, including $09 million recognized under FASB ASC Topic 450 Contingencies and carried forward from prior years and $21 million recognized upon adoption of the tax provision changes as a reduction to retained
earnings.Included in the $21 million accrual was $01 million in related interest, net of federal income tax benefits. During 2011, we recognized a net increase of $02 million in liabilities and at December31, 2011, had $38 million in
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. During 2012, we recognized a net decrease of $25 million in liabilities and at December31, 2012, had $13 million in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. Included in this liability amount were
$002 million accrued for the related interest, net of federal income tax benefits and $002 million for the related penalties recorded in income tax expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Management expects an additional reduction of
$04 million in the reserve over the next twelve months due to statute expirations.

A summary of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Balance as of December31, 2012 1,325 
Valuation allowance deferred taxes For financial reporting purposes, we recorded a valuation allowance of $29 million as of December31, 2012 to offset a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss
carryforwards. Management regularly reviews our financial forecasts in an effort to determine our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes. Accordingly, the valuation allowance is adjusted periodically based on
managements estimate of the benefit the company will receive from such carryforwards. Basic and Diluted Net Earnings Per Share
Basic net earnings per share has been computed using the weighted average number of ClassA and Class B shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of ClassA and Class B common stock outstanding during the period plus the dilutive effects of stock options.
Options to purchase 1,151,998, 1,640,392 and 1,927,099 shares of ClassA common stock were outstanding at
December31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Unvested restricted stock shares of 10,000 were outstanding as of December31, 2010. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding exclude outstanding stock options whose exercise price is in
excess of the average price of the companys stock price. These options are excluded from the respective computations of diluted net income or loss per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. The number of anti-dilutive shares as of
December31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 was 860,449, 1,397,538 and 480,825, respectively. The following table sets forth the
shares used to compute basic and diluted net earnings per share for the periods indicated:  Year Ended December31 2010 2011 2012 Weighted average shares 24,086,829 24,475,102 24,577,605 Effect of dilutive securities - stock options 566,636 208,542 409,361

Segments We have historically had one reportable operating segmentradio broadcasting. Our radio-broadcasting segment operates radio stations throughout the United States, various radio networks and our
National sales group. Beginning with the first quarter of 2011, we separated our non-broadcast segment into two operating segments, Internet and Publishing. We believe that this information regarding our non-broadcast segment is useful to readers of
our financial statements. Additionally, due to growth within our Internet operations, including the acquisition of WorshipHouseMedia.com on March28, 2011, our Internet segment qualifies for disclosure as a reportable segment. All prior periods
presented have been updated to reflect the separation of these non-broadcast segments. Our Internet segment operates all of our websites and our consumer product sales. Our publishing segment operates our print magazine and Xulon Press, a
print-on-demand book publisher. We present our segment operating results in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. Variable
Interest Entities We account for entities qualifying as variable interest entities VIEs in accordance with
FASB ASC Topic 810, Consolidation which requires VIEs to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interests in the VIE. A VIE is an entity for which the
primary beneficiarys interest in the entity can change with changes in factors other than the amount of investment in the entity. We may enter into LMAs contemporaneously with entering an APA to acquire or sell a radio station. We may also enter into Time Brokerage Agreements TBAs. Typically, both
LMAs and TBAs are contractual agreements under which the station 
77 Table of Contents
owner / licensee makes air-time available to a programmer / licensee in exchange for a fee and reimbursement of certain expenses. LMAs and TBAs are subject to compliance with the
antitrust laws and the Communications Laws, including the requirement that the licensee must maintain independent control over the station and, in particular, its personnel, programming, and finances. The FCC has held that such agreements do not
violate the Communications Laws as long as the licensee of the station receiving programming from another station maintains ultimate responsibility for, and control over, station operations and otherwise ensures compliance with the Communications
Laws. The requirements of FASB ASC Topic 810 may apply to entities under LMAs or TBAs, depending on the facts and
circumstances related to each transaction. We did not consolidate any entities with which we entered into LMAs or TBAs under the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 810 as of December31, 2012. 
Concentrations of Business Risks We derive a substantial part of our total revenues from the sale of advertising. For the years ended December31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, 433%, 430% and 423% of our total revenues, respectively, were
generated from the sale of broadcast advertising. We are particularly dependent on revenue from stations in the Los Angeles and Dallas markets, which generated 158%, and 188%, respectively, of our total net advertising revenues for the year ended
December31, 2010, 152% and 232% for the year ended December31, 2011 and 162% and 236% for the year ended December31, 2012. Because substantial portions of our revenues are derived from local advertisers in these key markets,
our ability to generate revenues in those markets could be adversely affected by local or regional economic downturns. Concentrations of
Credit Risks Our credit risk is spread across a large number of customers, none of which account for a significant volume
of revenue or outstanding receivables. We do not normally require collateral on credit sales; however, credit histories are reviewed before extending substantial credit to any customer. We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on
customers payment history and perceived credit risks. Bad debt expense has been within managements expectations. Use of
Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant areas for which management uses estimates
include, but are not limited to: 1asset impairments, including broadcasting licenses and goodwill; 2income tax valuation allowances; 3uncertain tax positions; 4allowance for doubtful accounts; 5self-insurance
reserves; 6fair value of equity awards; 7estimated lives for tangible and intangible assets; 8fair value measurements; and 9contingency reserves. These estimates require the use of judgment as future events and the
effect of these events cannot be predicted with certainty. The estimates will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired and as more information is obtained. We evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis
and we may consult outside experts to assist as considered necessary. Reclassifications 
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. These
reclassifications include the separation of our non-broadcast segment into two operating segments, Internet and Publishing. We believe that this information regarding our non-broadcast segments is useful to readers of our financial statements.
Additionally, due to growth within our Internet operations, including the acquisition of WorshipHouseMedia as discussed in Note 3, our Internet segment qualifies for disclosure as a reportable segment. All prior periods presented have been updated
to reflect the separation of these non-broadcast segments. These reclassifications also include the accounting for discontinued operations as described in more detail in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In October 2012, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2012-04, Technical Corrections and Improvements. The amendments in this update cover a wide range of Topics in
the Accounting Standards Codification. These amendments include technical corrections and improvements to the Accounting Standards Codification and conforming amendments related to fair value measurements. The amendments in this update will be
effective for fiscal periods beginning after December15, 2012. The adoption of ASU 2012-04 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
78 Table of Contents
In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, Intangibles Goodwill and Other
Testing Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets for Impairment. The updated guidance gives companies the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not, defined as a likelihood of more than
50%, that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then the company is required to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and perform
the quantitative impairment test in accordance with ASU 350-30. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after September15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted ASU 2012-02 as of our
2012 annual impairment testing performed in the fourth quarter of 2012. Adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Balance Sheet Topic 210: Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and
Liabilities. This ASU requires us to disclose both net and gross information about assets and liabilities that have been offset, if any, and the related arrangements. The disclosures under this new guidance are required to be provided
retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. We are required to apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of ASU 2011-11 is
not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. NOTE 2. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND
OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS We account for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets in
accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350 IntangiblesGoodwill and Other. We do not amortize goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets, but rather test for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances
indicate that an asset may be impaired. Approximately 71% of our total assets as of December31, 2012, consist of
indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as broadcast licenses, goodwill and mastheads, the value of which depends significantly upon the operating results of our businesses. In the case of our radio stations, we would not be able to operate the
properties without the related FCC license for each property. Broadcast licenses are renewed with the FCC every eight years for a nominal cost that is expensed as incurred. We continually monitor our stations compliance with the various
regulatory requirements. Historically, all of our broadcast licenses are renewed at the end of their respective periods, and we expect that all broadcast licenses will continue to be renewed in the future. Accordingly, we consider our broadcast
licenses to be indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. Broadcast licenses account for approximately 94% of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and
magazine mastheads account for the remaining 6%. We do not amortize goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets, but rather test for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be
impaired. We complete our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year. We believe that our estimate of the
value of our broadcast licenses, mastheads, and goodwill is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets, and our estimates incorporate variables and assumptions that are based on experiences and
judgment about future operating performance of our markets and business segments. The fair value measurements for our indefinite-lived intangible assets use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that
market participants would use in measuring fair value including assumptions about risk. The unobservable inputs are defined in FASB ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures as Level 3 inputs discussed in detail in Note 7 to
our Consolidated Financial Statements. Broadcast Licenses 
The unit of accounting we use to test broadcast licenses is the cluster level, which we define as a group of radio stations operating in
the same geographic market, sharing the same building and equipment and managed by a single general manager. The cluster level is the lowest level for which discrete financial information and cash flows are available and the level reviewed by
management to analyze operating results. In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU2012-02, Intangibles Goodwill
and Other Topic 350. Under ASU 2012-02, we have the option to assess whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If it is more likely than not that impairment exists, we are required to perform a
quantitative analysis to estimate the fair value of the assets. The qualitative assessment requires significant judgment in considering events and circumstances that may 
79 Table of Contents
affect the estimated fair value of our broadcast licenses and to weigh the events and circumstances by what we believe to be the strongest to weakest indicator of potential impairment. ASU
2012-02 is effective for annual and interim impairment tests for fiscal years beginning after September15, 2012, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the provisions of ASU 2012-02 as of our 2012 annual testing period. During 2011 and
prior years, we applied the start-up income approach to estimate the fair value of each of our broadcast licenses. We
reviewed the significant assumptions in our most recent fair value estimates that were completed during our annual testing period ending December31, 2011. Our review included an assessment to determine if events and circumstances have occurred
that could affect the significant inputs used in these fair value estimates. Our 2011 fair value calculations were prepared using the start-up income approach to estimate the fair value of the broadcast license. The start-up-income approach measures
the expected future economic benefits that the broadcast licenses provide and discounts these future benefits using a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow analysis assumes that the broadcast licenses hypothetical start-up stations
and the values yielded by the discounted cash flow analysis represent the portion of the stations value attributable solely to the broadcast license. The discounted cash flow model incorporates variables such as projected revenues, operating profit
margins, forecasted growth rates, estimated start-up costs, losses expected to be incurred in the early years, competition within the market, the effective tax rate, future terminal values and the risk-adjusted discount rate. The variables used
reflect historical company growth trends, industry projections, and the anticipated performance of the business. The discounted cash flow projection period was determined to be ten years; which is typically the time radio station operators and
investors expect to recover their investments as widely used by industry analysts in their forecasts. The key estimates and
assumptions used in the start-up income valuation for all of our broadcast licenses were as follows:  Broadcast Licenses
December31,2011 Discount rate
90 Operating profit margin ranges
38% - 380 Long-term market revenue growth rate ranges
10% - 40%
We reviewed each of the key estimates and assumptions and determined that there have been no significant
changes that would need to be applied to a hypothetical start-up station in order to estimate the fair value. Projected revenues, operating profit margins, forecasted growth rates, estimated start-up costs, losses expected to be incurred in the
early years, competition within the market, the effective tax rate, future terminal values and the risk-adjusted discount rate are consistent with those applied in the 2011 testing period. We also reviewed internal benchmarks and economic
performance for each of our markets to conclude that we could reasonably rely upon the 2011 fair value estimates and assumptions as a starting point to our qualitative analysis. 
We calculated the amount by which the 2011 estimated fair values exceeded our carrying amounts to calculate the excess of fair value. We
concluded that markets with broadcast licenses with a 25% or more excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value were not likely to be impaired. We believe based on our analysis and review, including the financial performance of each
market, that a 25% excess fair value margin is conservative and reasonable in the qualitative analysis. The tables below
present the percentage within a range by which the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of our broadcasting licenses for each of our clusters:  Geographic Clusters as of December31, 2012

We considered the 12 markets with an excess fair value that was less than 25% of the carrying values to
be more likely than not impaired. For these markets, we engaged Bond Pecaro, an independent third-party appraisal and valuation firm to perform a quantitative appraisal of our broadcast licenses. Bond Pecaro utilized the
start-up income approach to value broadcast licenses. The key estimates and assumptions used in the Bond Pecaro start-up income valuation for these selected markets were as follows:  Broadcast Licenses

value of our broadcast licenses as of the annual testing periods ending December31, 2012. Based on prior tests, we determined that no impairments of our broadcast licenses were necessary for years ending December31, 2011 or 2010,
respectively. Mastheads Mastheads consist of the graphic elements that identify our publications to readers and advertisers. These include customized typeset page headers, section headers, and column graphics as well as other
name and identity stylized elements within the body of each publication. We test the value of mastheads as a single combined publishing entity as our print magazines operate from one shared facility under one general manager with operating results
and cash flows reported on a combined basis for all publications. Based on actual operating results as of our year end
testing period that did not meet or exceed our expectations, we performed a quantitative review of mastheads as of our annual testing period ending December31, 2012. We had also performed an interim valuation of mastheads as of June30,
2012 in which our excess fair value was estimated to be only 17%. We engaged Bond Pecaro, an independent third-party appraisal firm, to perform an income-based approach to determine the estimated fair value of our mastheads. The income
approach is based upon an estimated royalty stream that measures a cost savings to the business because it does not have to pay a royalty to use the owned trade name and content. The analysis assumes that the assets are employed by a typical market
participant in their highest and best use. Under the income approach, we utilize a discounted cash flow method to calculate the estimated fair value of our mastheads, the key estimates and assumptions to which are as follows:  Mastheads
December31,2010

30 30 30 30%
We recognized an impairment charge of $01 million associated with the value of mastheads in our
publishing segment as of the annual testing period ending December31, 2012. This impairment was driven by a reduction in projected net revenues resulting from ongoing operating results that have not met expectations. The impairment was
indicative of trends in the publishing industry as a whole and is not unique to our company or operations. Goodwill -
Broadcast During 2012, we adopted ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment. As a result, beginning in
2012, the first step of the impairment tests for goodwill is a thorough assessment of qualitative factors to determine if events or circumstances indicate that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of these assets is less than their
carrying amounts. If the qualitative test indicates it is not more likely than not that the fair value of these assets is less than their carrying amounts, a quantitative assessment is not required. The unit of accounting used to test broadcast
licenses is the cluster level, which we define as a group of radio stations

operating in the same geographic market, sharing the same building and equipment and managed by a single general manager. Nine of our 31 market clusters and our networks have goodwill associated
with them as of our annual testing period ending December31, 2012. The first step of our review included an assessment
to determine if events and circumstances have occurred that could affect the significant inputs used in our fair value estimates. We estimated fair values using a market and income approach and compared the estimated fair value of each cluster to
its carrying value including goodwill. Using a market approach, we applied a multiple of four to each clusters station operating income SOI to calculate the estimated fair value. Radio stations are often sold on the basis of a
multiple of projected cash flow, or SOI. Numerous trade organizations and analysts track these radio transactions. Based on reports and analysis of these transactions, we believe industry benchmarks to be in the six to seven times cash flow range.
Based our analysis, we determined that an SOI benchmark of four would be a conservative indicator of fair value. Under the income approach, we utilized a discounted cash flow method to calculate the estimated fair value of the accounting unit. The
discounted cash flow method incorporates the cumulative present value of the net after-tax cash flows projected for each market assuming that it is a hypothetical start-up station. The key estimates and assumptions used in the start-up income
valuation of our broadcast markets for each testing period are as follows:  December31 Goodwill Broadcast Market Clusters

025% - 35 10% - 40 03% - 150%
If the carrying amount, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value of the cluster, an
indication exists that the amount of goodwill attributed to that cluster may be impaired. When we have indication of impairment, we perform a second step to determine the amount of any impairment. We engaged Bond Pecaro, an independent
third-party appraisal and valuation firm, to determine the enterprise value of three of our markets in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The enterprise valuation assumes that the subject assets are installed as part of an operating
business rather than as a hypothetical start-up. The key estimates and assumptions used for our enterprise valuations are as follows:  December31, 2012

Based on our review and analysis we determined that no broadcast goodwill impairment charges were
necessary as of the annual testing periods ending December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. The estimated fair value of our networks exceeded the carrying value by 1200%, 1016%, and 986% for each of the annual testing periods ending
December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The tables below present the percentage within a range by which the
enterprise value exceeded the carrying value of each of our clusters, including goodwill:    Carrying Value Including Goodwill 10 10%to20 20%to50 than 50 Number of market clusters 2 1 1 5 Enterprise carrying value in thousands 18,836 1,423 10,506 132,645 Broadcast Market Clusters as ofDecember31,2011  Carrying Value Including Goodwill 10 10%to20 20%to50 than50 Number of market clusters 1 2 3 2 Enterprise carrying value in thousands 9,877 17,487 68,506 5,178   10 10% to 20 20% to 50 than 50 Number of market clusters 2 2 3 Enterprise carrying value in thousands 19,502 66,871 7,295  82 Table of Contents
Goodwill Internet Publishing 
During 2012, we adopted ASU2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment. As a result, beginning in 2012, the first step of
the impairment tests for goodwill is a thorough assessment of qualitative factors to determine if events or circumstances indicate that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of these assets is less than their carrying amounts. If the
qualitative test indicates it is not more likely than not that the fair value of these assets is less than their carrying amounts, a quantitative assessment is not required. The units of accounting we use to test goodwill in our Internet business
include Townhall.com and Salem Web Network. The operating results for Salem Web Network reflect the operating results and cash flows for all of our Internet sites exclusive of Townhall.com. We also separate our publishing business into two
accounting units. The first publishing accounting unit is the magazine unit, which operates and produces all publications from a stand-alone facility, under one general manager, with operating results and cash flows of all publications reported on a
combined basis. The second accounting unit is our book publishing division, Xulon Press, which also operates from a stand-alone facility, under one general manager who is responsible for the separately stated operating results and cash flows. Four
of these accounting units have goodwill associated with them as our annual testing period. We applied a market approach to
estimate the fair value of each or our accounting units. Under the market approach, we applied a multiple of four to each accounting units operating income to estimate the fair value. We believe that a multiple of four is a conservative
benchmark based on actual industry transactions. The first step of our review compared the estimated fair value of each accounting unit to its carrying value including goodwill. If the carrying amount, including goodwill, exceeded the estimated fair
value of the unit, an indication exists that the amount of goodwill attributed to that unit may be impaired. When we have indication of impairment, we performed a second step to determine the amount of any impairment. We engaged Bond
Pecaro, an independent third-party appraisal and valuation firm, to determine the enterprise value of one of our accounting units in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The enterprise valuation assumes that the subject assets are
installed as part of an operating business rather than as a hypothetical start-up. The key estimates and assumptions used for our enterprise valuations are as follows:  December31 Enterprise Valuations

The key assumptions in our third-party enterprise valuation varied from the testing period ending
December31, 2011 to the testing period ending December31, 2010 due to the accounting units for which the enterprise valuations were performed. Due to the nature of the business, publishing varies greatly from our print magazines to our
online print-on demand digital book publisher and our Internet businesses. The key estimates for 2012 include the ranges applicable to both publishing and our Internet businesses. 
Based on our review and analysis we determined that no impairment charges were necessary as of the annual testing periods ending
December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. The table below presents the percentage within a range by which the enterprise value exceeded the carrying value of our accounting units, including goodwill. Internet and Publishing Accounting units as of December31, 2012

We believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our
indefinite-lived intangible assets, however, these estimates and assumptions could be materially different from actual results. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the industry or by us, or if events occur or
circumstances change that would reduce the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets below the amounts reflected on our balance sheet, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material.

December31, 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively, which includes depreciation of $53,000 for each of the years ended December31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 on a radio station tower that was valued at $08 million under a capital lease obligation.
Accumulated depreciation associated with the capital lease was $185,000, $238,000 and $291,000 at December31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. During June 2012, based on changes in managements planned usage, land in Covina, CA was classified as held for sale and evaluated for impairment as of that date. In accordance with the authoritative
guidance for impairment of long-lived assets held for sale, we determined the carrying value of the land exceeded the estimated fair value less cost to sell. We recorded an impairment charge of $56 million associated with this land based on the
estimated sale price. In December 2012, after several purchase offers for the land were terminated, we obtained a third party valuation for the land. Based on this fair value appraisal, we recorded an additional $12 million impairment charge
associated with the land. The table below presents the fair value measurements used to value this asset. Fair Value Measurements Using Dollars in thousands Description

NOTE 6. NOTES PAYABLE AND LONG-TERM DEBT 
Our parent company, Salem Communications Corporation, has no independent assets or operations, the subsidiary
guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several, and any subsidiaries of the parent company other than the subsidiary guarantors are minor. Senior Credit Facility On December1, 2009, our
parent company, Salem Communications Corporation entered into the Revolver. We amended the Revolver on November1, 2010 to increase the borrowing capacity from $30 million to $40 million. The amendment allows us to use borrowings under the
Revolver, subject to the Available Amount as defined by the terms of the Credit Agreement, to redeem applicable portions of the 95/8% Notes. The calculation of the Available Amount also pertains to the payment of dividends when the leverage
ratio is above 50 to 1. On November15, 2011, we completed the Second Amendment of our Revolver to among other things,
1extend the maturity date from December1, 2012 to December1, 2014, 2change the interest rate applicable to LIBOR or the Wells Fargo base rate plus a spread to be determined based on our leverage ratio, 3allow us
to borrow and repay unsecured indebtedness provided certain conditions are met and 4include step-downs related to our leverage ratio covenant. We incurred $05 million in fees to 
90 Table of Contents
complete this amendment, which are being amortized over the remaining term of the agreement. The applicable interest rate relating to the amended credit agreement is LIBOR plus a spread of
30%per annum or the Base Rate plus a spread of 125%per annum, which is adjusted based on our leverage ratio. If an event of default occurs, the interest rate may increase by 20%per annum. Details of the change in our rate based
on our leverage ratio are as follows:  Consolidated Leverage Ratio
BaseRate EurodollarRateLoans ApplicableFeeRate Less than 325 to 100 075 225 040 Greater than or equal to 325 to 100 but less than 450 to 100 075 250 050 Greater than or equal to 450 to 100 but less than 600 to 100 125 300 060 Greater than or equal to 600 to 100 225 350 075 The Revolver includes a $5 million subfacility for standby letters of credit and a subfacility for
swingline loans of up to $5 million, subject to the terms and conditions of the credit agreement relating to the Revolver. In addition to interest charges outlined above, we pay a commitment fee on the unused balance based on the Applicable Fee Rate
in the above table. If an event of default occurs, the interest rate may increase by 200%per annum. Amounts outstanding under the Revolver may be paid and then reborrowed at the companys discretion without penalty or premium. We believe
the borrowing capacity of the Revolver allows us to meet our ongoing operating requirements, fund capital expenditures, and satisfy our debt service requirements. The Revolver includes a $5 million subfacility for standby letters of credit and a
subfacility for swingline loans of up to $5 million, subject to the terms and conditions of the credit agreement relating to the Revolver. Amounts outstanding under the Revolver may be paid and then reborrowed at Salems discretion without
penalty or premium. At December31, 2012, the blended interest rate on amounts outstanding under the Revolver was 332%. 
With respect to financial covenants, the credit agreement includes a maximum leverage ratio of 625 to 10 and a minimum interest
coverage ratio of 15 to 1. The maximum leverage ratio declines over time until December31, 2014, at which point it is 550 to 1. The credit agreement also includes other negative covenants that are customary for credit facilities of this
type, including covenants that, subject to exceptions described in the Credit Agreement, restrict the ability of Salem and the guarantors: ito incur additional indebtedness; iito make investments; iiito make distributions,
loans or transfers of assets; ivto enter into, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any liens; vto sell assets; vito enter into transactions with affiliates; viito merge or consolidate with, or dispose of all or
substantially all assets to, a third party; viiito prepay indebtedness; and ixto pay dividends. As of December31, 2012, our leverage ratio was 487 to 1 and our interest coverage ratio was 223 to 1. We were in compliance with
our debt covenants under the Revolver at December31, 2012, and we remain in compliance. Senior Secured Second Lien Notes
On December1, 2009, we issued $3000 million principal amount of 95/8% Notes at a discount for $2981 million resulting in an effective yield of 975%. Interest is due and payable on
June15 and December15 of each year, commencing June15, 2010 until maturity. We are not required to make principal payments on the 95/8% Notes that are due in full in December 2016. The 95/8% Notes are guaranteed by all of our existing domestic restricted subsidiaries. Upon issuance, we were required to pay
$289 million per year in interest on the then outstanding
95/
8% Notes. As of December31, 2011 and 2012, accrued interest on the 95/8% Notes was $10 million and $09 million, respectively. The discount is being amortized to interest expense over the term
of the 95/8% Notes based on the effective interest method. For each of the twelve
months ended December31, 2012 and 2011, approximately $02 million, respectively, of the discount has been recognized as interest expense. On December12, 2012, we redeemed $40 million of the 95/8% Notes for
$41 million, or at a price equal to 103% of the face value. This transaction resulted in a $02 million pre-tax loss on the early retirement of debt, including approximately $17,000 of unamortized discount and $01 million of bond issue costs
associated with the 95/8% Notes. 
On June1, 2012, we redeemed $175 million of the 95/8% Notes for $180 million, or at a price equal to 103% of the face value. This transaction resulted in a $09 million
pre-tax loss on the early retirement of debt, including approximately $80,000 of unamortized discount and $03 million of bond issue costs associated with the 95/8% Notes. On December12, 2011, we redeemed $125 million of the 95/8% Notes for
$129 million, or at a price equal to 103% of the face value. This transaction resulted in a $08 million pre-tax loss on the early retirement of debt, including approximately $62,000 of unamortized discount and $03 million of bond issue costs
associated with the 95/8% Notes. 
91 Table of Contents
On September6, 2011, we repurchased $50 million of the 95/8% Notes for $51 million, or at a price equal to 1027/8% of the face value. This transaction resulted in a $03 million pre-tax loss on the early retirement of debt, including
approximately $26,000 of unamortized discount and $01 million of bond issue costs associated with the 95/8% Notes.
On June1, 2011, we redeemed $175 million of the 95/8% Notes for $180 million, or at a price equal to 103% of the face value. This transaction resulted in a $11 million
pre-tax loss on the early retirement of debt, including $01 million of unamortized discount and $05 million of bond issue costs associated with the 95/8% Notes. Information regarding repurchases and redemptions of the 95/8% Notes are as

Subordinated Credit Facility with First California Bank On May21, 2012, we entered into a new Business Loan Agreement, Promissory Note and related loan documents with First California Bank the FCB Loan. The FCB Loan is an unsecured, $100
million fixed-term loan with a maturity date of June15, 2014. The interest rate for the FCB Loan Interest Rate is variable and shall be equal to the greater of: a4250% or bthe Wall Street Journal Prime Rate as
published in The Wall Street Journal and reported by FCB plus 1%. We are required to repay the FCB Loan as follows:
atwenty-three 23consecutive monthly interest payments based upon the then-current principal balance outstanding at the then-current Interest Rate commencing on September15, 2012; bseven quarterly consecutive principal
payments of $125 million each commencing on September15, 2012; and cone final principal and interest payment on June15, 2014 of all outstanding and unpaid interest and principal as of such maturity date. The FCB Loan may be
prepaid at any time subject to a minimum interest charge of Fifty Dollars $50. If an event of default occurs on the FCB Loan, the Interest Rate may increase by 500%per annum. At December31, 2012, the outstanding principal balance on
the FCB loan was $75 million with approximately $23,906 of accrued interest. The FCB Loan is unsecured and is subordinate in
all respects to our existing Revolver. Our obligations under the FCB Loan are guaranteed by personal guaranties executed in favor of FCB by Edward G. Atsinger III, Salems CEO and board member, Mr.Stuart Epperson, Salems Chairman of
the Board and board member and trusts controlled by these two individuals. With respect to financial covenants, the FCB Loan includes a maximum leverage ratio of 625 to 10 through December31, 2012, 600 to 10 from January1, 2013
through December31, 2013, and 550 to 10 from January1, 2014 through maturity; and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 15 to 1. The FCB Loan also includes other customary negative covenants that restrict the ability of Salem and the
guarantors: ito incur additional indebtedness; iito make investments; iiito make distributions, loans or transfers of assets; ivto enter into, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any liens; vto sell
assets; vito enter into transactions with affiliates; viito merge or consolidate with, or dispose of all or substantially all assets to, a third party; viiito prepay indebtedness; and ixto pay dividends. At
December31, 2012, our leverage ratio was 487 to 1 and our interest coverage ratio was 223 to 1. We were in compliance with our debt covenants under the FCB Loan at December31, 2012, and we remain in compliance. 
Subordinated Debt due to Related Parties On November17, 2011, we entered into subordinated lines of credit with Edward G. Atsinger III, Chief Executive Officer and director of Salem, and Stuart W. Epperson, Chairman of Salems board
of directors. Pursuant to the related agreements, Mr.Epperson has committed to provide an unsecured revolving line of credit to Salem in a principal amount of up to $3 million, and Mr.Atsinger has committed to provide an unsecured
revolving line of credit in a principal amount of up to $6 million. On May21, 2012, we entered into a subordinated line of credit with Roland S. Hinz, a Salem board member. Mr.Hinz committed to provide an unsecured revolving line of
credit in a principal amount of up to $60 million. On September12, 2012, we amended and restated the original subordinated line of credit with Mr.Hinz to increase the unsecured revolving line of credit by $60 million for a total line
of credit of up to $120 million together, the Subordinated Debt due to Related Parties. 
92 Table of Contents
The proceeds of the subordinated lines of credit may be used to
repurchase a portion of Salems outstanding
95/
8% Notes. Outstanding amounts under each subordinated line of credit will bear interest at a rate equal to the lesser
of 15%per annum and 2the maximum rate permitted for subordinated debt under the Revolver referred to above plus 2%per annum. Interest is payable at the time of any repayment of principal. In addition, outstanding amounts
under each subordinated line of credit must be repaid within three 3months from the time that such amounts are borrowed, with the exception of the subordinated line of credit with Mr.Hinz, which must be repaid within six
6months from the time that such amounts are borrowed. The subordinated lines of credit do not contain any covenants. At December31, 2011 and 2012, $90 million and $150 million, respectively, was outstanding under the Subordinated
Debt due to Related Parties. Because the transactions with Msrs. Atsinger, Epperson and Hinz described above constitute
related party transactions, the nominating and corporate governance committee the Committee of Salems board of directors approved the entry by Salem into the subordinated lines of credit any definitive credit agreements
associated therewith. As part of its consideration, the Committee concluded that the terms of the subordinated lines of credit were more favorable to Salem as compared to terms of lines of credit available from unaffiliated third parties.
Additionally, in August 2012, the company obtained a fairness opinion from Bond Pecaro confirming this conclusion. Summary of
long-term debt obligations Long-term debt consisted of the following: As of December31 2011 2012 Dollars in thousands Revolver under senior credit facility 31,000 33,000 95/8% senior

93 Table of Contents NOTE 7. FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING 
FASB ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures established a hierarchal disclosure framework
associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring fair value. This framework defined three levels of inputs to the fair value measurement process and requires that each fair value measurement be assigned to a level
corresponding to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three broad levels of inputs defined by the FASB ASC Topic 820 hierarchy are as follows:  Level 1 Inputsquoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to
access at the measurement date;  Level 2 Inputsinputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and  Level 3 Inputsunobservable inputs for the asset or liability. These unobservable inputs reflect the entitys own assumptions about the
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances which might include the reporting entitys own data.
As of December31, 2012, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivables,
accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued interest approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of such instruments.The carrying value of other long-term liabilities approximates fair value as the related interest rates
approximate rates currently available to the company.

NOTE 9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
The company enters into various agreements in the normal course of business that contain minimum guarantees. The
typical minimum guarantee is tied to future revenue amounts that exceed the contractual level. Accordingly, the fair value of these arrangements is zero. The company and its subsidiaries, incident to its business activities, are parties to a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits, arbitration and other claims. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties
and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance. The company maintains insurance that may provide coverage for such matters. Consequently, the company is unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or the financial
impact with respect to these matters. The company believes, at this time, that the final resolution of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect upon the companys annual consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. 
95 Table of Contents
Salem leases various land, offices, studios and other equipment under operating leases that
generally expire over the next ten to twenty-five years. The majority of these leases are subject to escalation clauses and may be renewed for successive periods ranging from one to five years on terms similar to current agreements and except for
specified increases in lease payments. Rental expense included in operating expense under all lease agreements was $154 million, $149 million and $157 million in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.

NOTE 10. STOCK OPTION PLAN 
We have one stock option plan. The Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Incentive Plan the Plan allows the
company to grant equity-based awards, including stock options and restricted share awards to employees, advisors and non-employee members of the Board of Directors to the company. At the annual meeting of the company held on June22, 2012, the
company stockholders approved a revision to the Plan to increase the number of shares authorized by 1,900,000. As a result, a maximum of 5,000,000 shares are now authorized under the Plan. Options generally vest over a four-year period and have a
maximum term of five years from the vesting date. The Plan provides that vesting may be accelerated in certain corporate transactions of the company. The Plan provides that the Board of Directors, or a committee appointed by the Board, have
discretion, subject to certain limits, to modify the terms of outstanding options. We recognize non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to the estimated fair value of stock options granted in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718
CompensationStock Compensation. During the year ending December31, 2012, the Board of Directors
accelerated the vesting period for two outstanding stock awards issued to two employees. This accelerated vesting resulted in additional compensation cost of $01 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2012. The following table reflects the
components of stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December31, 2010, 2011 and 2012:  Year Ended December31 2010 2011 2012 Dollars in thousands Stock option compensation expense included in corporate expenses 947 603 933 Restricted stock shares compensation expense included in corporate expenses 17 4 Stock option compensation expense included in broadcast operating expenses 380 281 305 Stock option compensation expense included in Internet operating expenses 79 52 111 Stock option compensation expense included in publishing operating expenses 14 10 19

Stock option and restricted stock grants The Plan allows the company to grant stock options and shares of restricted stock to employees, directors, officers and advisors of the company. The option exercise price is set at the closing price of
the companys common stock on the date of grant, and the related number of shares granted is fixed at that point in time. The Plan also provides for grants of restricted stock. Eligible employees may receive stock options annually with the
number of shares and type of instrument generally determined by the employees salary grade and performance level. In addition, certain management and professional level employees typically receive
96 Table of Contents
a stock option grant upon commencement of employment. Non-employee directors of the company have been awarded restricted stock grants that vest one year from the date of issuance as well as stock
options that vest immediately. The Plan does not allow key employees and directors restricted persons to exercise options during pre-defined blackout periods. Employees may participate in 10b5-1 plans that allow them to exercise options according
to predefined criteria. We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options as of the
grant date. The expected volatility considers the historical volatility of our stock as determined by the closing price over a six to ten year term that is generally commensurate with the expected term of the option. Expected dividends reflect the
quarterly dividends authorized and declared on March7, 2012,May31, 2012,August30, 2012, and November29, 2012 of $0035 per share on ClassA and Class B common stock. The expected term of the options are based
on evaluations of historical and expected future employee exercise behavior. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected term of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were
granted. We use historical data to estimate future forfeiture rates to apply against the gross amount of compensation expense determined using the option valuation model. The weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the stock options using the Black-Scholes option valuation model were as follows for the years ended December31, 2010, 2011 and
2012:  Year Ended December31 2010 2011 2012 Expected volatility 9426 10149 10237 Expected dividends 00 00 507 Expected term in years 73 75 82 Risk-free interest rate 311 164 166 Stock option information with respect to the companys stock-based compensation plans during the

Leases with Principal Stockholders 
A trust controlled by the Chief Executive Officer of the company, Edward G. Atsinger III, owns real estate on which assets of one radio
station are located. Salem has entered into a lease agreement with this trust. Rental expense related to this lease included in operating expense for 2010, 2011 and 2012 amounted to $156,000, $160,000 and $165,000, respectively. 
Land and buildings occupied by various Salem radio stations are leased from entities owned by the companys CEO and its Chairman of
the Board. Rental expense under these leases included in operating expense for 2010, 2011 and 2012 amounted to $13 million, respectively. 
Subordinated Debt due to Related Parties On November17, 2011, we entered into subordinated lines of credit with Edward G. Atsinger III, Chief Executive Officer and director of Salem, and Stuart W. Epperson, Chairman of Salems board
of directors. Pursuant to the related agreements, Mr.Epperson has committed to provide an unsecured revolving line of credit to Salem in a principal amount of up to $3 million, and Mr.Atsinger has committed to provide an unsecured
revolving line of credit in a principal amount of up to $6 million. On May21, 2012, we entered into a line of credit with Roland S. Hinz, a Salem board member. Mr.Hinz committed to provide an unsecured revolving line of credit in a
principal amount of up to $60 million. On September12, 2012, we amended and restated the original line of credit with Mr.Hinz to increase the unsecured revolving line of credit by $60 million for a total line of credit of up to $120
million together, the Subordinated Debt due to Related Parties. The proceeds of the
Subordinated Debt due to Related Parties may be used to repurchase a portion of Salems outstanding 95/8% Notes.
Outstanding amounts under each subordinated line of credit will bear interest at a rate equal to the lesser of 15%per annum and 2the maximum rate permitted for subordinated debt under the Revolver referred to above plus
2%per annum. Interest is payable at the time of any repayment of principal. In addition, outstanding amounts under each subordinated line of credit must be repaid within three 3months from the time that such amounts are borrowed, with
the exception of the subordinated line of credit with Mr.Hinz, which must be repaid within six 6months from the time that such amounts are borrowed. The subordinated lines of credit do not contain any covenants. At December31,
2011 and 2012, $90 million and $150 million, respectively, was outstanding under the Subordinated Debt due to Related Parties. Because the transactions with Msrs. Atsinger, Epperson and Hinz described above constitute related party transactions, the nominating and corporate governance committee the Committee of
Salems board of directors approved the entry by Salem into the subordinated lines of credit and any definitive credit agreements associated therewith. As part of its consideration, the Committee concluded that the terms of the subordinated
lines of credit were more favorable to Salem as compared to terms of lines of credit available from unaffiliated third parties. Additionally, in August 2012, the company obtained a fairness opinion from Bond Pecaro confirming this
conclusion. Radio Stations Owned by the Eppersons Nancy A. Epperson, the wife of the Chairman of the Board, Stuart W. Epperson, currently serves as an officer, director and stockholder of six radio stations in Virginia, five radio stations in North
Carolina, and five radio stations in Florida. Chesapeake-Portsmouth Broadcasting Corporation Chesapeake-Portsmouth is a company controlled by Nancy Epperson, wife of Salems Chairman of the Board Stuart W. Epperson and sister of

The markets where these radio stations are located are not currently served by stations owned and operated by the company. Under his
employment agreement, Mr.Epperson is required to offer the company a right of first refusal of opportunities related to the companys business. Radio Stations Owned by Mr.Hinz Mr.Hinz, a director of the
company, through companies or entities controlled by him, operates three radio stations in Southern California. These radio stations are formatted in Christian Teaching and Talk programming in the Spanish language.

During the period ended March31, 2010, we recorded a loss of $02 million associated with a second lien real estate note with an
employee. NOTE 12. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN We maintain a 401k defined contribution plan the 401k Plan, which covers all eligible employees as defined in the 401k Plan. Participants are allowed to make non-forfeitable

contributed by each participant and 25% on the next 3% contributed but does not match participants contributions in excess of 6% of their compensation per pay period. The company match was temporarily suspended in July 2008 as part of an
extensive cost-reduction program. The company match was reinstated effective January1, 2012 under new terms that allow for a company match of 50% on the first 5% of the amounts contributed by each participant. During the year ending
December31, 2012, we contributed and expensed $13 million in the 401k Plan. NOTE 13. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY

SEGMENT DATA 
FASB ASC Topic 280 Segment Reporting requires companies to provide certain information about their
operating segments. We have historically had one reportable operating segmentradio broadcasting. Our radio broadcasting segment operates radio stations throughout the United States, as well as various radio networks and our National sales
group. Beginning with the first quarter of 2011, we separated our non-broadcast segment into two operating segments, Internet and Publishing. We believe that this information regarding our non-broadcast segment is useful to readers of our financial
statements. Additionally, due to growth within our Internet operations, including the acquisition of WorshipHouseMedia.com on March28, 2011, our Internet segment meets the threshold for disclosure as a reportable segment. All prior periods
presented have been updated to separate these non-broadcast segments. Our Internet segment operates all of our websites and our consumer product sales. Our publishing segment operates our print magazine and Xulon Press, a print-on-demand book
publisher.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
On February 25, 2013, we launched a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of the
outstanding 95/8% Notes and a related consent solicitation collectively, the Tender Offer to amend the indenture governing the 95/8% Notes the Indenture. In connection with the Tender Offer, we plan to enter into a new senior secured term loan of up to $300 million, which will be used to fund the purchase of any 95/8% Notes that are tendered in the Tender Offer. We also plan to enter into a new senior secured revolving

95/8% Notes in the Tender Offer, substantially all of the restrictive covenants, certain events of default and other provisions contained in the Indenture will be eliminated and the liens on the assets that
secure the 95/8% Notes will be released, making any 95/8% Notes that remain outstanding after the consummation of the Tender Offer effectively subordinated to the new term loan
and the new revolving credit facility to the extent of the value of the collateral. The proceeds from these facilities will be used to fund the Tender Offer and retire all other outstanding corporate debt. Holders of the 95/8% Notes who tender by the consent payment deadline, which is 5:00 pm, New York City time, on March 8, 2013, will receive a consent payment as part of the Tender Offer consideration. The Tender Offer is
anticipated to expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on March 22, 2013. Regardless of whether we obtain the requisite consents from holders of the
95/8% Notes in the Tender Offer, we intend, at our sole discretion and without any obligation to do so, to retire any
95/8% Notes that are not tendered in the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, which may include redeeming the 95/8% Notes at a redemption price equal to 1000% of the principal amount of the
95/8% Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as defined in the Indenture as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date the Make Whole

redemption date the 10% Redemption. The first $260 million of untendered 95/8% Notes are expected to be redeemed pursuant to the 10% Redemption on June 1, 2013, the next $40 million of untendered 95/8% Notes are expected to be redeem pursuant to the 10% Redemption on December 12, 2013, and the balance of untendered
95/8% Notes are expected to be redeemed pursuant to the Make Whole Redemption on the applicable redemption date following the requisite notice. Upon entry into the new term loan and the new revolving credit
facility, the Revolver, FCB Loan, and Subordinated Debt due to Related Parties will be terminated.
