The other schedules have not been submitted because they are not
applicable. 26             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and stockholders
of ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedule of ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. a Delaware corporation,
formerly SPI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiaries listed in the index on page
25 of this Form 10-K. These financial statements and the financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 13 to the financial statements, as of December 31,
1996, the Company has net monetary assets of $134,000,000 at ICN Yugoslavia
which would be subject to foreign exchange loss if a devaluation of the
Yugoslavian dinar were to occur.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the consolidated results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1996 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information required to be included therein. COOPERS & LYBRAND L.L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1996 1.  ORGANIZATION AND BACKGROUND   On November 1, 1994, the stockholders of ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ICN,
SPI  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. SPI,  Viratek,  Inc. Viratek and ICN
Biomedicals, Inc. Biomedicals collectively, the Predecessor Companies
approved the Merger of the Predecessor Companies the Merger. Effective
November 1, 1994, SPI, ICN and Viratek merged into ICN Merger Corp. and
Biomedicals merged into ICN Subsidiary Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICN
Merger Corp. In conjunction with the Merger, ICN Merger Corp. was renamed ICN
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. the Company.
The Merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
Additionally, for accounting purposes, SPI was treated as the acquiring company
and, as a result, the Company has reported the historical financial data of SPI
in its financial results and includes the results of ICN, Viratek and
Biomedicals since the effective date of the Merger.
SPI was incorporated on November 30, 1981, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
ICN and was 39%-owned by ICN prior to the Merger. Viratek and Biomedicals were
63%-owned and 69%-owned by ICN, respectively, prior to the Merger.
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION:  The accompanying consolidated financial
statements for 1996 and 1995 include the accounts of the Company and all of its
majority owned subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements for 1994
include the full year financial results of SPI and majority owned subsidiaries
and the financial results of ICN, Viratek and Biomedicals from the effective
date of the Merger. Investments in 20% through 50% owned affiliated companies
are included under the equity method where the Company exercises significant
influence over operating and financial affairs. Investments in less than 20%
owned companies are recorded at cost. The accompanying consolidated financial
statements reflect the elimination of all significant intercompany account
balances and transactions.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 1996
and 1995 includes $28,687,000 and $1,017,000, respectively, of certificates of
deposit which have maturities of three months or less. For purposes of the
statements of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid investments
purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The
carrying amount of these assets approximates fair value due to the short-term
maturity of these instruments.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES: In 1995, the Company classified its investment in
corporate bond securities, with maturities ranging from 1999 to 2003, as
available for sale. Changes in market values were reflected as unrealized gains
and losses, calculated on the specific identification method, in stockholders'
equity. The contractual maturity value of these securities was $26,700,000. In
January 1996, the Company sold $26,663,000 of corporate bond securities for a
total of $26,952,000 resulting in a realized gain of $289,000.
INVENTORIES: Inventories, which include material, direct labor and factory
overhead, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on a
first-in, first-out FIFO basis.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: The Company primarily uses the straight-line
method for depreciating property, plant and equipment over their estimated
useful lives. Buildings and related improvements are depreciated from 7-50
years, machinery and equipment from 3-30 years, furniture and fixtures from 3-15
years and leasehold improvements and capital leases are amortized over their
useful lives, limited to the life of the related lease. 32
ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1996   The Company follows the policy of capitalizing expenditures that materially
increase the lives of the related assets and charges maintenance and repairs to
expense. Upon sale or retirement, the costs and related accumulated depreciation
or amortization are eliminated from the respective accounts and the resulting
gain or loss is included in income.
The Company capitalizes interest on borrowed funds during construction
periods. Capitalized interest is charged to Property, Plant and Equipment and
amortized over the lives of the related assets.
GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES: The difference between the purchase price and the
fair value of net assets acquired at the date of acquisition is included in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets as goodwill and intangibles. Goodwill
and intangibles amortization periods range from 5 to 23 years depending upon the
nature of the business or products acquired. The Company periodically evaluates
the carrying  value of goodwill and  intangibles  including the related
amortization periods. The Company determines whether there has been impairment
by comparing the anticipated undiscounted future operating income of the
acquired entity or product line with the carrying value of the goodwill. Based
on its review, the Company does not believe that an impairment of its goodwill
and intangibles has occurred.
NOTES PAYABLE: The Company classifies various borrowings with initial terms
of one year or less as notes payable. The weighted average interest rate on
short-term borrowings outstanding at December 31, 1996 and 1995 was 17% and 58 respectively. The December 31, 1995 weighted average interest rate reflects a
hyperinflationary 66% rate at ICN Yugoslavia.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: The assets and liabilities of the Company
foreign operations,  except those in highly inflationary economies,  are
translated at the end of period exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are
translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. The
effects of unrealized exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency
assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are accumulated in stockholders'
equity. The monetary assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries in highly
inflationary economies are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the end of period
exchange rates and non-monetary assets and liabilities at historical exchange
rates. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, the Company has included in earnings all
foreign exchange gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions and
the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on subsidiaries operating in
highly inflationary economies. The recorded gains losses from foreign exchange
translation and  transactions for 1996, 1995 and 1994, were $2,282,000 9,484,000 and $191,000 respectively.
INCOME TAXES: Income taxes are calculated in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
SFAS No. 109 is an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequence of
events that have been recognized in the Company financial statements or tax
returns. A valuation allowance is established, when necessary, to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. In estimating future
tax consequences, SFAS No. 109 generally considers all expected future events
other than an enactment of changes in the tax law or rates.
USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
PER SHARE INFORMATION: Net income loss per share is based on net income
loss after preferred stock dividend requirements, the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding, including shares issued subject to put option, and 33
ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1996
the dilutive effect of common share equivalents. Common share equivalents
represent shares issuable for outstanding options, on the assumption that the
proceeds would be used to repurchase shares in the open market, and the shares
issuable related to the Company convertible preferred stock and to certain of
the Company convertible debentures. Such convertible preferred stock and
convertible debentures are considered common stock equivalents if they meet
certain criteria at the time of issuance and have a dilutive effect, if
converted.
During 1996, the Company Board of Directors declared quarterly cash
distributions for the first, second and third quarters totaling $23 per share.
On January 31, 1997, the Company Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter
cash distribution of $077 per share, payable to stockholders of record on
February 13, 1997. In 1995, the Company issued quarterly stock distributions
which totaled 56%. In 1994,  the Company  issued stock  dividends and
distributions which totaled 48%. All share and per share amounts used in
computing earnings per share have been restated to reflect these stock dividends
and distributions.
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION: The Company has adopted the disclosure-only
provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS No.
123 defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock
option. Fair value of the stock option is determined considering factors such as
the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the current price of the
underlying stock and its volatility, expected dividends on the stock, and the
risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option. Under the fair
value based method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the
fair value of the award and is recognized over the service period. Pro forma
disclosures for entities that elect to continue to measure compensation cost
under the intrinsic method provided by Accounting Principles Board No. 25 must
include the effects of all awards granted in fiscal years that begin after
December 15, 1994.
RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain prior year items have been reclassified to
conform with the current year presentation.
3.  ACQUISITION OF THE PREDECESSOR COMPANIES   As part of the Merger, the Company issued approximately 6,476,770 common
shares valued on November 10, 1994 at $2075 per share, which was the publicly
traded price of SPI common shares at that date. Accordingly, the purchase
price, including direct acquisition costs of $3,654,000, has been allocated to
the estimated fair value of the net assets, including amounts ascribed to
purchased research and development costs which were charged to operations
immediately following the consummation of the Merger.
The purchase price allocation, as of the effective date of the Merger, is
summarized as follows in thousands                                      
Current assets including cash of $9,921 of which $1,425 was restricted. $ 37,711

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1996   The Company obtained independent third party appraisals for the acquired
in-process research and development costs and certain other intangible costs,
primarily patents and trademarks.  The $221,000,000 which represents the
valuation of acquired  in-process research and development for which no
alternative use exists, has been charged to operations immediately upon
consummation of the Merger in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. In the fourth quarter of 1995, the purchase price allocation was
finalized by recording a liability for a pre-acquisition contingency, in an
amount that the Company considers adequate.
4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   GENERAL: Prior to the Merger, ICN controlled Biomedicals and Viratek
through stock ownership and board representation and was affiliated with SPI.
Certain officers of ICN occupied similar positions with SPI, Biomedicals, and
Viratek. Prior to the Merger, ICN, SPI, Biomedicals, and Viratek engaged in
certain transactions with each other.
ROYALTY AGREEMENTS: Effective December 1, 1990, SPI entered into a royalty
agreement with Viratek whereby a royalty of 20% of all sales of VirazoleR was
paid to Viratek. Sales of VirazoleR, for purposes of determining royalties to
Viratek for 1994 were $35,855,000, which generated royalties to Viratek for 1994
of $7,171,000. As a result of the Merger, the Company is no longer required to
pay this royalty on VirazoleR.
The Company, under an agreement amended in 1993 between the Company and the
employer of a former director, is required to pay $2000 for each new aerosol
drug delivery device manufactured and a 2% royalty on all sales of VirazoleR
in aerosolized form. Such royalties for 1995 and 1994 were $905,000 and
$741,000, respectively.
COST ALLOCATIONS: Prior to the Merger, the affiliated corporations occupied
ICN facility in Costa Mesa, California.  The accompanying consolidated
statements of income include a charge for rent from ICN of $230,000 in 1994. In
addition, the costs of common services such as maintenance, purchasing and
personnel were incurred by SPI and allocated to ICN, Viratek and Biomedicals
based on services utilized. The total of such costs was $2,207,000 for 1994 of
which $1,579,000 was allocated to affiliated corporations. It is management
belief that the methods used and amounts allocated for facility costs and common
services were reasonable based upon the usage by the respective companies. As a
result of the Merger, such cost allocations are no longer required.

as described above, between the Company and the former affiliated corporations

DECEMBER 31, 1996   In July 1995, the Company loaned the Chief Operating Officer $93,000 for
the exercise of stock options which was repaid in March 1996.
In August 1996, the Company loaned the Chairman and CEO $428,000 in regards
to tax matters relating to the exercise of stock options. This loan along with
accrued interest was repaid in November 1996.
In June 1996, the Company made a short-term loan to the Chairman and CEO in
the amount of $3,500,000 for certain personal obligations. During August 1996,
this amount was repaid to the Company. In connection with this transaction, the
Company guaranteed $3,600,000 of debt of the Chairman with a third party bank.
In addition to the guarantee, the Company deposited $3,600,000 with this bank as
collateral to the Chairman debt. This deposit is recorded as a long-term asset
on the balance sheet. The Chairman has provided collateral to the Company
guarantee in the form of a right to the proceeds of the exercise of stock
options in the amount of 100,000 options with an exercise price of $2275 and
the rights to a $4,000,000 life insurance policy provided by the Company. In the
event of any default on the debt to the bank, the Company has recourse that is
limited to the collateral described above. Both the transaction and the
sufficiency of the collateral for the guarantee were approved by the Board of
Directors.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1996   In connection with the Merger,  the Company acquired  approximately
$226,000,000 of net operating loss carryforwards NOLs. Included in the total
acquired NOLs were $191,000,000 of domestic NOLs and $35,000,000 of foreign
NOLs. Internal Revenue Service Code Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on
the availability of NOLs that can be used to reduce taxable income after certain
substantial ownership changes of a corporation. Consequently, the Company
annual limitation on utilization of the acquired domestic NOLs is approximately
$33,000,000 per year.
In accordance with SFAS No. 109, any realization of acquired tax benefits
must be used to first, reduce goodwill, secondly, reduce acquired noncurrent
intangible assets and lastly, reduce income tax expense. During 1995, the
Company utilized $27,000,000 of acquired domestic NOLs having a tax benefit of
$9,400,000 for which a valuation allowance had been established as of the
effective date of the Merger. The corresponding reduction in the valuation
allowance of $9,400,000 resulted in a reduction of goodwill and intangibles
acquired in connection with the Merger.
In addition to the utilization of the NOLs described above, the Company
recognized during 1995 a $27,000,000 tax benefit of an additional $76,000,000 of
acquired NOLs and other deferred tax assets through a reduction in the Company
deferred tax asset valuation allowance. This reduction resulted in a $24,000,000
reduction in goodwill and intangibles acquired in connection with the Merger and
a $3,000,000 reduction in deferred income tax expense. Realization of the
deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior
to expiration of the loss carryforwards. Although realization is not assured,
management believes it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred
tax assets will be realized. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered
realizable, however, could be reduced in the future if estimates of future
taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced.
At December 31, 1996, the Company domestic NOLs were approximately
$160,000,000. These domestic NOLs expire in varying amounts from 1998 to 2008. 37

New Certificates, the terms of which remain the same except that 71 shares
per SFr. 5,000 principal certificate can be exchanged at $4715 using a fixed
exchange rate of SFr. 149 to U.S. $100. Substantially all of the outstanding
Old Certificates were exchanged for New Certificates together referred to as
Bio Certificates. Currently, the face value of the outstanding Bio Capital,
SFr. 39,615,000, is convertible into 552,992 shares of the Company common
stock at the exchange prices of $4715 and $8126 using fixed exchange rates of
SFr. 149 and SFr. 154 to U.S. $100 for New and Old  Certificates,
respectively.  The fair value of the Zero Coupon  Guaranteed Bonds was
approximately $7,611,000 at December 31, 1996.
During 1996, SFr. 4,952,000 of the 3-1/4% Subordinated Double Convertible
Bonds due 1997 were converted into 6,190 shares of Ciba Geigy Ltd. Common stock.
The Company has the option to redeem the ICN-Swiss Franc Xr Bonds and Bio
Certificates in the event that the market price of the Company common stock
meets certain conditions. 40

7.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES LITIGATION
In the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint for Violations of
Federal Securities Laws the Securities Complaint the 1995 Actions,
plaintiffs allege that Defendants made various deceptive and untrue statements
of material fact and omitted material facts regarding its hepatitis C NDA in
connection with: i the Merger of the Company, SPI, Viratek and Biomedicals in
November 1994 and the issuance of convertible  debentures in connection
therewith; and ii information provided to the public. Plaintiffs also allege
that the Chairman of the Company traded on inside information relating to the
hepatitis C NDA. The Securities Complaint asserts claims for alleged violations
of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10b and 20a of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule I 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.
Plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages, pre-judgment and post-judgment
interest and attorneys' fees and costs.  Plaintiffs  motion seeking the
certification of i a class of persons who purchased ICN securities from
November 10, 1994 through February 17, 1995; and ii a subclass consisting of
persons who owned SPI and/or Biomedicals common stock prior to the Merger was
granted. Defendants filed their answer to the Securities Complaint, and are
actively engaged in the pre-trial discovery process. This trial is currently
scheduled to commence in January 1998. Defendants intend to vigorously defend
this action. 41

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1996   Four lawsuits have been filed with respect to the Merger in the Court of
Chancery in the State of Delaware the 1994 Actions. Three of these lawsuits
were filed by stockholders of SPI and, in one lawsuit, of Viratek against ICN,
SPI, Viratek in the one lawsuit and certain directors and officers of ICN, SPI
and/or Viratek including the Chairman and purport to be class actions on
behalf of all persons who held shares of SPI and Viratek common stock. The
fourth lawsuit was filed by a stockholder of Viratek against ICN, Viratek and
certain directors and officers of ICN, SPI and Viratek including the Chairman
and purports to be a class action on behalf of all persons who held shares of
Viratek common stock. These suits allege that the consideration provided to the
public stockholders of SPI and/or Viratek in the Merger was unfair and
inadequate, and that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in approving
the Merger and otherwise. The 1994 Actions have been inactive. The Company
believes that these suits are without merit and intends to defend them
vigorously.
Management believes that, having extensively reviewed the issues in the
above referenced matters, there are strong defenses and the Company has and
continues to defend the litigation vigorously. While the ultimate outcome of the
1995 Actions and 1994 Actions cannot be predicted with certainty, and an
unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on the Company, at this
time management does not expect these matters will have a material adverse
effect on the financial position and results of operations of the Company.
ICN, SPI and Viratek and certain of their current and former officers and
directors collectively, the ICN Defendants were named defendants in certain
consolidated class actions. Plaintiffs alleged that the ICN Defendants made, or
aided and abetted PaineWebber, Inc. in making, misrepresentations of material
fact and omitted material facts concerning the business, financial condition and
future prospects of ICN, Viratek and SPI in certain public announcements,
PaineWebber research reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. In October, 1996, the Company entered into a settlement agreement
with the plaintiffs. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company agreed to
pay $4,500,000 in cash and $10,000,000 in common stock of the Company, based
upon the fair market value of the stock on the date of settlement. On January 6,
1997, the court approved the settlement and signed the order and judgment
dismissing the amended complaint with prejudice.
INVESTIGATIONS: Pursuant to an Order Directing Private Investigation and
Designating Officers to Take Testimony,  entitled In the Matter of ICN
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., P-177 the Order, a private investigation is being
conducted by the SEC with respect to certain matters pertaining to the status
and disposition of the hepatitis C NDA. As set forth in the Order, the
investigation concerns whether, during the period June 1994 through February
1995, the Company, persons or entities associated with it and others, in the
offer and sale or in connection with the purchase and sale of ICN common stock,
engaged in possible violations of Section 17a of the Securities Act of 1933
and Section 10b of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 42
ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1996 thereunder, by having possibly: i made false or misleading statements or
omitted material facts with respect to the status and disposition of the
hepatitis C NDA; or ii purchased or sold ICN common stock while in possession
of material, non-public information concerning the status and disposition of the
hepatitis C NDA; or iii conveyed material, non-public information concerning
the status and disposition of the hepatitis C NDA, to other persons who may have
purchased or sold ICN stock. The Company is cooperating with the SEC in its
investigation. The Company has and continues to produce documents to the SEC
pursuant to its request and the SEC has taken the depositions of certain current
and former officers, directors, and employees of the Company.
In addition, the Company received a Subpoena from a Grand Jury of the
United States District Court, Central District of California, requesting the
production of documents covering a broad range of matters over various time
periods. The Company and Milan Panic are subjects of the investigation. The
Company has and continues to cooperate in the production of documents pursuant
to the Subpoena. A number of current and former employees of the Company have
been interviewed by the government in connection with the investigation.
The Company is a party to a number of other pending or threatened lawsuits.
In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these other matters
will not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial position
or results of operations.
PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE: The Company could be exposed to possible
claims for personal injury resulting from allegedly defective products. While to
date no material adverse claim for personal injury resulting from allegedly
defective products has been successfully maintained against the Company, a
substantial claim, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the
Company.
BENEFITS PLANS: The Company has a defined contribution plan that provides
all U.S. employees the opportunity to defer a portion of their compensation for
payout at a subsequent date. The Company can voluntarily make matching
contributions on behalf of participating and eligible employees. The Company
expense related to such defined contribution plan was not material in 1996, 1995
and 1994.
In connection with the Merger, the Company assumed deferred compensation
agreements with certain officers and certain key employees of the Predecessor
Companies, with benefits commencing at death or retirement. As of December 31,
1996, the present value of the deferred compensation benefits to be paid has
been accrued in the amount of $2,914,000. Interest accrues on the outstanding
balance at rates ranging from 95% to 126%. No new contributions are being
made; however, interest continues to accrue on the present value of the benefits
expected to be paid.
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN HUNGARY: In connection with the acquisition of
Alkaloida from the government of Hungary, an environmental remediation fund the
Fund of approximately $7,200,000 was established by the government from the
proceeds that the Company tendered. This Fund will be used to remediate a waste
disposal site adjacent to Alkaloida, contaminated by past plant operations, by
1998. If the cash from this Fund is insufficient to fully remediate the waste
disposal site, the Company is liable for the shortfall. The Company believes,
based upon current third party studies and estimates, that the cash in the Fund
is adequate to remediate the waste disposal site.

DECEMBER 31, 1996
OTHER: Milan Panic, the Company Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer, is employed under a contract expiring December 31, 1998 that provides
for, among other things, certain health and retirement benefits. The contract is
automatically extended at the end of each year for successive one year periods
unless either the Company or Mr. Panic terminates the contract upon six months
prior written notice. Mr. Panic, at his option, may provide consulting services
upon his retirement for $120,000 per year for life, subject to annual
cost-of-living adjustments from the base year of 1967, and will be entitled when
serving as a consultant to participate in the Company medical and dental
plans. Including such cost-of-living adjustments, the annual cost of such
consulting services is currently estimated to be in excess of $535,000. The
consulting fee shall not at any time exceed the annual compensation as adjusted,
paid to Mr. Panic. Upon Mr. Panic retirement, the consulting fee shall not be
subject to further cost of living adjustments.
The Company has employment agreements with six key executives which contain
change in control benefits. Upon a change in control of the Company as
defined in the contract, the employee shall receive severance benefits equal to
three times salary and other benefits.
8. COMMON STOCK   Prior to the Merger, each of the Predecessor Companies had their own stock
option plans. Upon consummation of the Merger, the Company assumed all options
outstanding under the existing stock option plans. The existing stock option
plans were exchanged for shares of the Company. Each option of SPI common stock,
ICN common stock, Viratek common stock and Biomedicals common stock was
exchanged for 10, 0512, 0499 and 0197 options of the Company common stock,
respectively. Subsequent to the Merger, no new grants are being issued under
these plans.
The 1994 Stock Option Plan was adopted on January 26, 1995 and subsequently
approved by stockholders. This plan provides for the granting of a maximum of
3,236,000 stock options. Under the plan each nonemployee director is granted
15,000 options on the day following the annual meeting of stockholders. 44

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1996   Under the terms of all stock option plans, the option price may not be less
than the fair market value at the date of the grant and may not have a term
exceeding 10 years. Option grants vest ratably over a four year period from the
date of the grant. The options granted are reserved for issuance to officers,
directors, key employees, scientific advisors and consultants. The Company has
adopted the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No. 123. Accordingly, no
compensation  cost has been recognized for the stock option plans. Had
compensation cost for the Company stock option plans been determined based on
the fair value at the grant date for awards in 1996 and 1995 consistent with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company net income and earnings per share
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below                              1996      1995

assumptions used for grants in 1996 and 1995: Dividend yield of 14%, expected
volatility of 6042%; risk-free interest rate of 625%; and expected lives of
65 years.
Because the determination of the fair value of all options granted includes
the factors described in the preceding paragraph and, because additional option
grants are expected to be made each year, the above pro forma disclosures are
not representative of pro forma effects of reported net income for future years. 45

DECEMBER 31, 1996   In January 1996, the Company sold approximately 400,000 shares of its
common stock to a foreign bank for net proceeds of $6,000,000. The proceeds were
used by the Company for the acquisition of GlyDerm, a Michigan based skin care
company, and several smaller acquisitions.
In conjunction with and conditioned upon the consummation of the sale of
the Siemens Shares See Note 15, the Company entered into an agreement the
Put Agreement with the Purchasers pursuant to which the Company sold 100,000
additional shares of common stock for $1,950,000 together with the Siemens
shares, the Purchaser Shares and sold the Purchaser the right to put the
Put Right 1,064,833 shares of common stock, valued at $23,120,000 at December
31, 1996, to the Company at $30 per share on January 10, 2000 for $3,200,000.
The exercisability of the Put Right is subject to acceleration under certain
circumstances as described in the Put Agreement. If an acceleration event
occurs, the exercise price of the put would be $2250 per share plus an
incremental increase at the annual rate of 10% for the period from the closing
date to the date of exercise of the Put Right. Additionally, the number of
shares subject to the Put Right would be reduced by one third during each of the
three years after the closing date if certain closing price thresholds and
conditions as specified in the Put Agreement are achieved. The number of shares
subject to the Put Right may also be reduced if the Purchaser sells any
Purchaser Shares in excess of certain specified prices during each of the years
after the closing date and until the Put Right expires.
In connection with the Merger, the Company adopted a Stockholder Rights
Plan to protect stockholders' rights in the event of a proposed or actual
acquisition of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company common
stock. As part of this plan, each share of the Company common stock carries a
right to purchase one one-hundredth 1/100 of a share of Series A Preferred
Stock the Right, par value $01 per share, of the Company at a price of $125
per one one-hundredth of a share, subject to adjustment, which becomes
exercisable only upon the occurence of certain events. The Rights are subject to
redemption at the option of the Board of Directors at a price of $01 per right
until the occurrence of certain events. The Rights expire on November 1, 2004.
In 1995, the Company issued quarterly stock distributions which totaled
56%. In 1994, the Company issued quarterly stock dividends and distributions
which totaled 48%. Accordingly, all relevant stock option data and per share
data have been restated to reflect these dividends and distributions.
In 1994, the Company issued common stock for certain bonuses accrued in
1993. The number of shares issued was based upon the fair value of the shares at
the date of issuance and a fixed amount related to the bonuses paid.
9.  PREFERRED STOCK
In October, 1996, the Company issued 50,000 shares of Series B preferred
stock for net proceeds of $47,392,000 with a liquidation preference of $1,000
per share. The preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder into
common stock based on a conversion price calculated using the average daily low
for the five trading days preceding the conversion date and applying a discount
ranging from 3% to 13%. The preferred stock has a 6% annual dividend that is
cumulative and payable quarterly. The Company has the option to pay the dividend
in either cash or common stock of the Company. The aggregate amount of preferred
stock that can be converted within the first two six-month periods following the
issuance of the preferred stock is restricted. The preferred stock is also
mandatorily convertible into common stock on the fifth anniversary of its
issuance. However, this provision is subject to extension under certain
circumstances. Dividends paid in common stock are based on the fair value of
common stock at the time of declaration. Net income attributable to common stock
reflects for purposes of computing earnings per share adjustments for cumulative
preferred dividends and an embedded dividend arising from discounted conversion
terms of the Series B preferred stock. The preferred stock was issued as a
private placement. 47

DECEMBER 31, 1996 12. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOWS DISCLOSURES NON-CASH TRANSACTIONS    During 1996, a principal  amount of SFr.  4,952,000 of the 3-1/4%
Subordinated Double Convertible Bonds due 1997 were converted into 6,190 shares
of Ciba-Geigy Ltd. common stock. The effect of the conversion was to reduce long
term debt by $4,240,000 and other assets by $3,988,000.
On March 29, 1996, the Company sold its instrument business division to
Titertek  Instruments,  Inc.  Titertek,  an Alabama corporation,  for
approximately $4,400,000 in the form of a note receivable from Titertek. Such
amount represents the net book value of the assets and liabilities of the
division, excluding certain assets and liabilities as specified in the contract,
plus a deferred gain of $2,000,000 to be recognized as cash is collected. As of
December 31, 1996, approximately $500,000 has been recognized into income.
During 1996, the Company issued 964,833 shares of common stock for the
acquisition of the Siemens dosimetry business, 213,385 shares for the Cappel
acquisition and 144,000 shares for the GlyDerm acquisition See Note 15. The
increase in goodwill and intangibles from the beginning of the year is
principally due to these acquisitions.
During 1996, the Company entered into capital leases of approximately
$2,973,000 for the purchase of computer equipment.
In November 1995, ICN Yugoslavia exchanged, in a non-recourse transaction,
accounts  receivable for  $10,900,000 of inventories  and $9,800,000 for
construction materials for its plant expansion.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT: ICN Yugoslavia, a 75% owned subsidiary, operates in a
business environment that is subject to significant economic volatility and
political instability. The current trend in Yugoslavia is toward unfavorable
economic conditions that include continuing liquidity problems, inflationary
pressures, unemployment, a weakened banking system and a high trade deficit. The
future of the economic and political environment of Yugoslavia is uncertain and
could deteriorate to the point that a material adverse impact on the Company
financial position and results of operations could occur.
LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS: In an effort by the Central Bank of Yugoslavia to
control  inflation  through tight monetary  controls,  Yugoslavia is now
experiencing severe liquidity problems. This has resulted in longer collection
periods on ICN Yugoslavia receivables. Most of ICN Yugoslavia customers are
slow to pay due to delays of health care payments by the government. This has
also resulted in ICN Yugoslavia being unable to make timely payments on its
payables. In 1997, ICN Yugoslavia will attempt to reduce its receivables and
improve its cash flow by restricting future sales; however, these actions may
result in sales and earnings in 1997 that are lower than 1996. ICN Yugoslavia
holds approximately $26,000,000 of cash in a bank outside of Yugoslavia
originally intended to be used for future plant expansion in Yugoslavia. These
funds may be available for working capital purposes if necessary.
INFLATION AND MONETARY EXPOSURE: ICN Yugoslavia operates in a highly
inflationary economy and uses the dollar as the functional currency rather than
the Yugoslavian dinar. Before the enactment of an economic stabilization program
in January 1994, the rate of inflation in Yugoslavia was over 1 billion percent
per year. The rate of inflation was dramatically reduced when, on January 24,
1994, the Yugoslavian government enacted a Stabilization Program designed to
strengthen its currency. Throughout 1994, this program was successful in
reducing inflation to approximately 5% per year, increasing the availability of
hard currency, stabilizing the exchange rate of the dinar, and improving the
overall economy in Yugoslavia.
Throughout 1995, the effectiveness of the stabilization program weakened
and ICN Yugoslavia began experiencing a decline in the availability of hard
currency and inflation levels accelerated to an approximate annual rate of 90%
by the end of the year. In expectation of a devaluation late in 1995, ICN
Yugoslavia took action early in the fourth quarter of 1995 to reduce its
monetary exposure by shortening the payment terms on its receivables, reducing
sales levels, accelerating the purchase of inventory and accelerating the
purchase of building materials for its plant expansion. On November 24, 1995,
the dinar devalued from a rate of 14 dinars per U.S. $1 to a rate of 47 dinars
per U.S. $1. On this date, ICN Yugoslavia had a net monetary liability position
that resulted in a gain of $8,724,000. 55
ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1996   Throughout 1996, the level of inflation in Yugoslavia has been relatively
stable with a Yugoslavian government reported inflation rate of 60%. During this
time the government has exercised restraint on the amount of dinars in
circulation. The net monetary asset position of ICN Yugoslavia has increased due
to rising accounts receivable balances resulting from higher sales and a
lengthening of the collection period of receivables. From a beginning balance of
$7,396,000 at December 31, 1995, the net monetary asset position of ICN
Yugoslavia has risen to $134,000,000 at December 31, 1996 which is subject to
foreign exchange loss if a devaluation of the dinar were to occur.
As required by generally accepted accounting principles GAAP, the
Company translates ICN Yugoslavia financial results at the dividend payment rate
established by the National Bank of Yugoslavia. To the extent that changes in
this rate lag behind the level of inflation, sales and expenses will, at times,
tend to be inflated. Future sales and expenses can increase substantially if the
timing of future devaluations falls significantly behind the level of inflation.
POTENTIAL DEVALUATION: The potential loss arising from a devaluation will
depend on the size of the devaluation and the magnitude of the net monetary
asset position at the time of the devaluation. The timing and the size of a
devaluation are strongly influenced by the amount of inflation and length of
time from the last devaluation. Since the last devaluation on November 24, 1995,
the overall level of inflation has been at an approximate annual rate of 60%.
The risk of devaluation increases as time passes and inflation continues. The
Company is unable to predict when a devaluation will occur.
GOVERNMENT SPENDING LIMITATIONS: The government has expressed its intention
to limit total 1997 health care spending on pharmaceuticals. Currently, ICN
Yugoslavia maintains a 50% market share for pharmaceutical  products in
Yugoslavia. With approximately 80% of ICN Yugoslavia sales arising from
government or government funded entities, ICN Yugoslavia is economically
dependent on the government. If the government continues to follow this course
of action it could result in a significant decrease in 1997 domestic sales. ICN
Yugoslavia plans to partially mitigate the effects of decreased domestic
spending by placing more emphasis on its export business and by promoting sales
to privately funded pharmacies. The extent that these actions will mitigate the
decreases in government spending is uncertain. The government decision to reduce
health care spending could have a material adverse affect on the financial
results of the Company.
CREDIT RISK: ICN Yugoslavia is subject to credit risk in that 80% or
$196,873,000 of 1996 Yugoslavian domestic sales are to the government or
government funded entities of which $123,706,000 is included in accounts
receivable at December 31, 1996. Included in Yugoslavian domestic sales and
accounts  receivable to government  funded  entities are $82,001,000 and
$88,069,000, respectively, to three major customers.  56

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1996   SANCTIONS: In December 1995, the United Nations Security Council adopted a
resolution that suspended economic sanctions that had been imposed on the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia since May 1992. A substantial majority of ICN
Yugoslavia business is conducted in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
Sanctions had contributed to an overall deteriorating business environment
in which ICN Yugoslavia operated and denied ICN Yugoslavia access to export
sales which previously totaled approximately $30,000,000 a year. Sanctions also
created restrictions on ICN Yugoslavia overseas investments and imposed
administrative burdens in obtaining raw materials outside of Yugoslavia.
The Company believes the suspension of sanctions continues to provide a
more favorable business environment; however, the beneficial effects of the
suspension will not take place immediately as the economy needs to adjust to new
opportunities. If Yugoslavia does not fully comply with the Dayton Accords,
there is a risk that sanctions could be reinstated.
PRICE CONTROLS: ICN Yugoslavia is subject to price controls in Yugoslavia.
The size and frequency of government approved price increases is influenced by
local inflation, devaluations, cost of imported raw materials and demand for ICN
Yugoslavia products. During 1996 and 1995, ICN Yugoslavia received fewer price
increases than in the past due to relatively lower levels of inflation. As
inflation rises, the size and frequency of price increases are expected to
increase. During the third quarter of 1995, ICN Yugoslavia received a 30% price
increase on its pharmaceutical products. This was the first price increase the
government had allowed since the start of the Stabilization Program. Subsequent
to the devaluation on November 24, 1995, ICN Yugoslavia received an 80% price
increase on its pharmaceutical products. Price increases obtained by ICN
Yugoslavia are based on economic events preceding the price increase and not on
expectations of ongoing inflation. This lag in permitted price increases creates
downward pressure on the gross margins that ICN Yugoslavia receives on its
products. When necessary, ICN Yugoslavia will limit sales of products that have
poor margins until an acceptable price increase is received. The impact of an
inability to obtain adequate price increases in the future could have an adverse
impact on the Company as a result of declining gross profit margins or declining
sales in an effort to maintain existing gross margin levels.
DIVIDENDS: In 1992, ICN Yugoslavia paid a $10,000,000 dividend of which the
Company received 75% or $7,500,000. Yugoslavian law allows free distribution of
earnings whether to domestic Yugoslavian or international investors. Under
this law a dividend must be declared and paid immediately after year end.
Earnings that are not immediately paid as a dividend cannot be used for future
dividends. Additionally, ICN Yugoslavia is allowed to pay dividends out of
earnings calculated under local statutory tax basis rules, not earnings
calculated under GAAP. ICN Yugoslavia dividends are payable in dinars which must
be exchanged for dollars before the dividend is repatriated. During high levels
of inflation the dinar denominated dividend could devalue substantially by the
time the dividend is exchanged for dollars. Under GAAP, ICN Yugoslavia had
accumulated  earnings,  which are not  available for  distributions,  of
approximately  $165,521,000  at December  31, 1996.  However,  additional
repatriation of cash could be declared from contributed capital for Yugoslavian
purposes of $360,000,000 at December 31, 1996, as provided for in the original
purchase agreement. In 1992, the Company made the decision to no longer
repatriate the earnings of ICN Yugoslavia and instead will use these earnings
for local operations, plant expansion, reduction of debt and additional
investment in Eastern Europe. 57

15. ACQUISITIONS   In September 1996, the Company acquired a majority interest in Alkaloida, a
pharmaceutical company in Hungary. The Company is investing $22,115,000 for a
60% interest in Alkaloida. An initial payment of $9,115,000 was made in
September 1996 and the final payment of $13,000,000 for this acquisition was
paid in January 1997. Alkaloida is a major producer of medicinal opiates and
morphine, as well as raw materials used in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The
purchase price allocation is preliminary pending the outcome of environmental
remediation studies expected to be completed in 1997. See also Note 7.
In September 1996, the Company acquired the assets and liabilities of the
Cappel Division Cappel of Organon Teknika Corporation. Cappel manufactures
and sells  immunochemical  reagents used in biotechnology and biomedical
laboratories around the world. The Company acquired the assets and liabilities
of Cappel, with a net book value of $2,078,000, for 213,385 shares of the
Company common stock valued at approximately $4,327,000 based upon the market
price of the stock at the time the shares were issued.
In July 1996, the Company acquired the assets and liabilities of the
Dosimetry Service Division Dosimetry of Siemens Medical Systems, Inc.
Siemens with a net book value of approximately $3,882,000, for $23,668,000,
for 964,833 shares of the Company common stock, valued at approximately
$22,616,000, based upon the market price of the stock at the time the shares
were issued and a $982,000 cash payment. Under the terms of the purchase
agreement, Siemens had the right, exercisable on or before December 23, 1996, to
require the Company to repurchase the 964,833 shares of common stock owned by
Siemens the Siemens Shares for $2351 per share in cash. On December 23,
1996, Siemens sold 964,833 shares of the Company common stock to certain
accounts over which an investment company exercises investment authority
collectively the Purchasers for $1950 per share. Upon the consummation of
the sale of the Company shares to the Purchasers, the Company paid Siemens
$4,378,000, which represented the excess of $2351 above $1950 for the 964,833
shares $3,869,000, plus interest, as specified in the purchase agreement. See
also Note 8.
During July 1996, the Company acquired a 49% interest in Polypharm, a
Russian pharmaceutical company located in Chelyabinsk.  The Company paid
approximately $1,100,000 in exchange for shares of Polypharm. During the third
quarter of 1996, the Company acquired an additional 16% interest in Polypharm
for approximately $500,000, raising its ownership to 65%. During the fourth
quarter, the Company acquired an additional 19% interest, raising its ownership
to 84%. Polypharm produces analgesics, antibiotics and antihistamines.
In June 1996, the Company acquired a 73% interest in Leksredstva, a Russian
pharmaceutical company, headquartered in Kursk, for approximately $5,700,000 in
cash. During the third quarter of 1996, the Company acquired an additional 22%
interest in Leksredstva for $500,000, from existing stockholders, increasing its
interest in Leksredstva to 95%. Leksredstva manufactures chemical products,
pharmaceutical  raw  materials  and  finished  form drugs  that  include
cardiovasculars, anticancer drugs, analgesics and iodine preparations. 58
