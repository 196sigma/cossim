REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF P-COM, INC.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of P-COM, Inc.
and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above. PRICE WATERHOUSE LLP

P-COM, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 -- THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company
P-COM, Inc. the Company was incorporated in Delaware on August 23, 1991 to
engage in the design, manufacture and marketing of millimeter wave radio systems
for use in the worldwide wireless telecommunications market. The Company also
markets diagnostic, maintenance and system configuration software tools that are
complementary to its radio systems.
On January 11, 1995, the Company effected a 1-for-3 reverse stock split. On
October 27, 1995, the Company effected a 2-for-1 forward stock split. All shares
and per share amounts have been adjusted retroactively to reflect these stock
splits. In conjunction with an initial public offering of the Company Common
Stock the Offering, all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock were converted
into Common Stock at the closing of the Offering on March 9, 1995.
Summary of significant accounting policies
The following is a summary of the Company significant accounting policies Management use of estimates and assumptions
- 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Principles of consolidation
- The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its majority owned and wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Foreign currency translation
- The functional currency of the Company majority owned subsidiary in Italy is
the local currency. Assets and liabilities of this subsidiary are translated
into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income
and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the period.
Accumulated net translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders' equity.
Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are included in the results of
operations, and were not material in all periods presented.
Cash and cash equivalents
- The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity when
acquired of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Revenue recognition
- Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment of the product provided
no significant obligations remain and collectibility is probable. Provisions for
estimated warranty repairs, returns and allowances are recorded at the
41
time products are shipped.
Inventory
- Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined on a
first-in, first-out basis.
Property and equipment
- Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method based upon the useful lives of the assets ranging from
three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the
straight-line method based upon the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the
lease term of the respective assets.
Software development costs
- The Company software products are integrated into its hardware products.
Software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological
feasibility are expensed as incurred. Software development costs incurred
subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility and before general
release to customers are capitalized, if material. To date, all software
development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological
feasibility have been immaterial.
Goodwill
- Goodwill, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
the net assets of the acquired entities, is being amortized on a straight-line
basis over the period of expected benefit ranging from five to seven years. The
carrying value of goodwill will be reviewed periodically based on the
undiscounted cash flows of the entity acquired over the remaining amortization
period. Should this review indicate that goodwill will not be recoverable, the
Company carrying value of the goodwill will be reduced by the estimated
shortfall of undiscounted cash flows.
Impairment of long-lived assets
- 
In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost of assets may
be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an
evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated
with the asset would be compared to the asset carrying amount to determine if
a write-down to market value or discounted cash flow value is required.
Income taxes
- The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, which
recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their financial statement reported amounts.
Concentration of credit risk
- Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, and
trade accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents in a
variety of financial instruments such as market rate accounts and U.S.
Government agency debt securities. The Company, by policy, limits the amount of
credit exposure to any one financial institution or commercial issuer.
To date, the Company has sold most of its products in international markets.
Sales to seven customers have been denominated in British pounds and at December
31, 1996 and 1995 amounts due from these customers represented 58% and 35 respectively, of accounts receivable. Any gains and/or losses incurred on the
settlement of these 
42
receivables are included in the financial statements as they occur and have been
immaterial to date. As of December 31, 1996 and 1995, the balance due in British
pounds was pound14,600,501 and pound4,300,000, respectively, and was
translated at $165 and $157, respectively, per British pound. The Company
intends to bill its customers in U.S. dollars whenever possible.
The Company extends credit terms to international customers of up to 120 days,
which is consistent with local business practices. The Company performs on-going
credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and, generally,
requires no collateral from its customers.
At December 31, 1996 and 1995, approximately 69% and 62%, respectively, of trade
accounts receivable represents amounts due from four customers.
Off-balance sheet risk
- The Company enters into foreign forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact
of currency fluctuations of anticipated sales to British customers. The
objectives of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of foreign currency
exchange rate movements on the Company operating results. The gains and losses
on forward exchange contracts are included in earnings when the underlying
foreign currency denominated transaction is recognized.
The foreign exchange forward contracts described above generally require the
Company to sell foreign currencies for U.S. dollars at rates agreed to at the
inception of the contracts. The forward contracts generally have maturities of
six months or less. These contracts generally do not subject the Company to
significant market risk from exchange rate movements because the contracts are
designed to offset gains and losses on the balances and transactions being
hedged. At December 31, 1996, the Company had forward contracts to sell
approximately $250 million in British pounds. The fair value of forward
exchange contracts approximates cost. The Company does not anticipate any
material adverse effect on its financial position resulting from the use of
these instruments.
Net income loss per share
- Net income loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of
common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the periods presented.
Common equivalent shares consist of Convertible Preferred Stock using the if
converted method and stock options and warrants using the treasury stock
method. Common equivalent shares from stock options and warrants are excluded
from the computation if their effect is antidilutive, except that, pursuant to
the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin, common and
common equivalent shares issued from January 1, 1994 through the closing of the
Company Offering on March 9, 1995 have been included in the computation using
the treasury stock method as if they were outstanding for all periods prior to
the initial public offering. Furthermore, in accordance with staff policy,
common equivalent shares from Convertible Preferred Stock that converted into
Common Stock upon the closing of the Offering are included using the if
converted method.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements
- 
The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121
SFAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long
Lived Assets to be Disposed of. SFAS 121 requires recognition of impairment of
long-lived assets in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the
future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. SFAS 121 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. Adoption of SFAS
121 has not had a material impact on the Company financial position or results
of operations.
The Company has also adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which establishes a
fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation plans, and requires
additional disclosures for those companies who elect not to adopt the new method
of accounting. The Company has elected to continue to measure compensation costs
using the intrinsic value method prescribed by 
43
APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and to comply
with the pro forma disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 See Note 5. As such,
adoption of SFAS 123 has had no impact on the Company financial statements.

authorized to issue 2,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $00001 per
share. The Board of Directors has the authority, without action by the
stockholders, to designate and issue preferred stock in one or more series and
to designate the dividend rate, voting rights and other rights, preferences and
restrictions of each series.
Common Stock
- In March 1995, the Company received net proceeds of $261 million from the sale
of 3,910,000 shares of Common Stock in the Offering, which was declared
effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 1995. In
September 1995, the Company received net proceeds of $108 million from the sale
of 720,000 shares of Common Stock in a follow-on public offering. In May 1996,
the Company received net proceeds of $525 million from the sale of 2,098,485
shares of Common Stock in a follow-on public offering. Earnings per share for
the year ended December 31, 1996 reflects the shares issued on a weighted
average computation from the date of their issuance and therefore does not
include the full dilutive effect of these shares.

NOTE 5 -- EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS At December 31, 1996, the Company had two stock-based compensation plans which
are described below. The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provision of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123, Accounting
for Stock Based Compensation. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been
recognized for its stock option plan or its stock purchase plan. Had
compensation costs for the Company two stock-based compensation plans been
determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those
plans, consistent with the method of SFAS 123, the Company net income and
earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated

Stock Option Plans
- On January 11, 1995, the Company Board of Directors adopted the 1995 Stock
Option/Stock Issuance Plan the 1995 Plan as a successor to its 1992 Stock
Option Plan the 1992 Plan. In addition to the 1,647,944 shares of Common
Stock authorized for issuance under the 1992 Plan, the 1995 Plan authorizes the
Board of Directors to issue an additional 320,000 shares of Common Stock in
1995, and 800,000 shares of Common Stock in 1996. As of January 11, 1995, no
further option grants or stock issuances were made under the 1992 Plan, and all
option grants and stock issuances made during the remainder of 1995 were made
under the 1995 Plan. All outstanding options under the 1992 Plan were
incorporated into the 1995 Plan.
Options granted under the 1992 plan are generally exercisable for a period not
to exceed ten years, and generally must be issued with exercise prices not less
than 100% and 85%, for incentive and non-qualified stock options, respectively,
of the estimated fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant as
determined by the Board of Directors. Options granted under the 1992 Plan are
exercisable immediately upon grant. Options granted under the 1992 Plan
generally vest 25% on the first anniversary from the date of grant, and ratably
each month over the remaining thirty-six month period. Unvested shares purchased
through the exercise of stock options are subject to repurchase by the Company.
The 1995 Plan contains three equity incentive programs: a Discretionary Option
Grant Program, a Stock Issuance Program for officers and employees of the
Company and independent consultants and advisors to the Company and an Automatic
Option Grant Program for non-employee members of the Company Board of
Directors.
Options under the Discretionary Option Grant Program may be granted at not less
than 85% of the fair market value per share of Common Stock on the grant date
with exercise periods not to exceed ten years. The Plan Administrator is
authorized to issue tandem stock appreciation rights and limited stock
appreciation rights in connection with the option grants.
The Stock Issuance Program provides for the sale of Common Stock at a price not
less than 85% of fair market value. Shares may also be issued solely for
services. The administrator has discretion as to vesting provisions, including
accelerations, and may institute a loan program to assist participants with
financing stock purchases. The program also provides certain alternatives to
satisfy tax liabilities incurred by participants in connection with the program.
Under the Automatic Option Grant Program, as amended at the May 1996 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders, participants will automatically receive an option to
purchase 20,000 shares of Common Stock upon initially joining the Board of
Directors and will receive an additional automatic grant each year at each
annual stockholders' meeting for 2,000 shares. Each option will have an exercise
price per share equal to 100% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on
the grant date. The shares subject to the initial share option and the annual
2,000 share option will vest in eight successive equal quarterly installments
upon the optionee completion of each successive 3-month period of Board
service over the 24-month period measured from the grant date.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of the grant using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions used for
grants in 1996 and 1995, respectively: expected volatility of 57 percent for all
years; weighted average risk-free interest rates of 60% and 64%, and weighted
average expected lives of 411 years and 288 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
- On January 11, 1995, the Company Board of Directors adopted the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan, which was approved by stockholders in
February 1995. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase Common
Stock at a discount through payroll deductions during successive offering
periods with a maximum duration of 24 months. Each offering period shall be
divided into consecutive semi-annual purchase periods. The price at which the
Common Stock is purchased under the Purchase Plan is equal to 85% of the fair
market value of the Common Stock on the first day of the offering period or the
last day of the purchase period, whichever is lower. The initial offering period
commenced on the effectiveness of the Offering. A total of 300,000 shares of
Common Stock has been reserved for issuance under the Purchase Plan, as amended
at the May 1996 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Awards and terms are established
by the Company Board of Directors. The Purchase Plan may be canceled at any
time at the discretion of the Company Board of Directors prior to its
expiration in December 2004. Under the Plan, the Company sold 94,400 shares and
25,934 shares in 1996 and 1995, respectively.
The fair value of the employees' purchase rights was estimated using the
Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions for 1996 and 1995,
respectively: expected volatility of 57 percent for all years; weighted-average
risk-free interest rates of 50% and 64%; and weighted-average expected lives
of 07 years and 12 years. The weighted-average fair value of those purchase
rights granted in 1996 and 1995 was $310 and $220, respectively.
