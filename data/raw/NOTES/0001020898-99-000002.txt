BOWLIN Outdoor Advertising
& Travel Centers Incorporated We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BOWLIN Outdoor
Advertising & Travel Centers Incorporated and subsidiaries as of January 31,
1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
January 31, 1999. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BOWLIN Outdoor
Advertising & Travel Centers Incorporated and subsidiaries as of January 31,
1999 and 1998, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended January 31, 1999, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.                   KPMG LLP

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
a Description of Business
BOWLIN Outdoor  Advertising & Travel Centers  Incorporated  and
subsidiaries the Company are located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. On
August 28, 1996, BOWLIN Outdoor Advertising & Travel Centers, Inc.
BOATC was incorporated in the state of Nevada. BOATC articles of
incorporation authorize 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock $001
par value which can be issued at the discretion of the board of
directors. Pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger effective
September 27, 1996, BOWLIN'S, Inc. BI, which was incorporated in the
state of New Mexico on February 20, 1953, was merged with and into
BOATC. Under the terms of the agreement, BI shareholders received 211
of the Company shares for each BI share. Accordingly, the Company
issued approximately 34 million shares of its common stock for all
the outstanding shares of BI stock and all references to the number of
shares of common stock have been retroactively restated to reflect the
exchange for all periods presented. The transaction was accounted for
in a manner similar to a pooling of interests.
The Company principal business activities include the operation of
full-service travel centers and restaurants which offer brand name
food and gasoline, and a unique variety of Southwestern merchandise to
the traveling public in the Southwestern United States. In addition to
the travel centers, the Company operates outdoor billboard advertising
displays which are situated on interstate highways, primarily in the
Southwestern United States.
Dragoon Water Company, Inc. Dragoon, a majority owned subsidiary,
was acquired by the Company in 1986. On October 1, 1996, the Company
sold Dragoon to an unrelated third party. The sale agreement provides
for the continued provision of adequate water utilities to the
Company.
The Company acquired all of the outstanding  stock of another
subsidiary,  BMI Inc. BMI, in November 1993.  BMI business
activities have historically been the acquisition of inventory in
Mexico which has been sold to the Company for the purpose of resale in
the United States. BMI has a January 31 fiscal year end.
Neither Dragoon nor BMI is considered material to the overall
operations of the Company.
The Company also held a majority general partnership interest in the
Los Cuatros Apartments Limited Partnership Los Cuatros together with
a limited partnership interest. The partnership owns and leases an
apartment complex in Las Cruces, New Mexico. The partnership was
formed in January 1991 and has a December 31 fiscal year end. On June
16, 1997, the Company sold Los Cuatros to an unrelated third party.                    32   b Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying  consolidated  financial statements include the
accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiary BMI and its
majority owned subsidiaries, Dragoon and Los Cuatros. Dragoon and Los
Cuatros are included from February 1, 1996 through their respective
dates sold. All material  intercompany  transactions  have been
eliminated or disclosure has been made of the effect of intervening
events from December 31 to January 31, if any, related to the
differing fiscal year ends for Dragoon and Los Cuatros.
c Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
d Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Trade receivables are stated at face amount less the related allowance
for doubtful accounts.
e Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of merchandise and gasoline for resale
and are stated at the lower of cost or market value, with cost being
determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
f Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost. Maintenance and repairs,
including the replacement of minor items, are expensed as incurred,
and major additions to property and equipment are capitalized.
Depreciation is provided by the Company using primarily straight-line,
as well as accelerated methods.
g Intangible Assets
Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over fair
value of net assets acquired, is amortized on a straight-line basis
over the expected periods to be benefited, generally 5 to 15 years.
The Company assesses the recoverability of this intangible asset by
determining whether the amortization of the goodwill balance over its
remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating
cash flows of the acquired operation.  The amount of goodwill
impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted future
operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the Company
average cost of funds. The assessment of the recoverability of
goodwill will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are
not achieved.
Covenants not-to-compete are amortized over the life of the respective
covenants using the straight-line method, ranging from one to ten
years.                    33      Franchise fees are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of the life of the related franchise agreements or the periods
estimated to be benefited, ranging from fifteen to twenty-five years.
h Sales and Cost Recognition
Sales of merchandise are recognized at the time of sale and the
associated costs of the merchandise are included in cost of sales.
Revenues from rental of billboard space are accounted for as operating
leases with rental  assets  recorded at cost less  accumulated
depreciation and rental income is recorded ratably over the life of
the lease contract.
i Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences  attributable to differences  between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their  respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.
j Stock-based Compensation
Effective February 1, 1996, the Company adopted the disclosure
provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
which requires pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per
share as if the SFAS No. 123 fair value method had been applied. The
Company continues to apply the provisions of Accounting Principles
Board APB Opinion No. 25,  Accounting  for Stock Issued to
Employees, for the preparation of its basic consolidated financial
statements.
k Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Long-lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of
Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered
to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair
value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the
lower of the carrying amount of fair value less costs to sell.                    34   l Financial Instruments
The Company financial instruments are cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable, short-term
borrowings, and long-term debt. The carrying amounts of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable,
accrued liabilities,  short-term borrowings,  and long-term debt
approximate fair value.
m Use of Estimates
Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and
assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these
consolidated  financial  statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
n Reclassification
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial
statements to conform to the current year presentation.
o Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share of common stock is computed by dividing net
income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated in the
same manner as basic earnings per share except that the denominator is
increased to include the number of additional common shares that would
have been outstanding, assuming the exercise of all employee stock
options that would have had a dilutive effect on earnings per share. A
reconciliation of the number of shares used in the calculation of
basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended January 31,
1999, 1998 and 1997 follows

Options to purchase 259,000, 301,500 and 338,000 shares of common
stock were outstanding during the years ended January 31, 1999 and
1998 and the last month of the year ended January 31, 1997,
respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS
because the options' exercise price was greater than the average
market price of the common shares. The options, which expire December
2006, were still outstanding at the end of the year ended January 31,
1999.

During the year ended January 31, 1998, the Company determined the actual
lives for approximately $214,100 of billboard expenditures were generally
longer than the estimated useful lives  previously  established for
depreciation purposes. Therefore, effective February 1, 1997, the Company
extended the estimated useful lives of those assets up to 7 years. The
effect of this change in accounting estimate increased net income by
$105,400 $02 per basic and diluted share.
During the year ended January 31, 1997, the Company determined the actual
lives for approximately $467,000 of equipment were generally longer than
the estimated useful lives  previously  established for depreciation
purposes. Therefore, effective February 1, 1996, the Company extended the
estimated useful lives of those assets, which are depreciated using the
straight-line method, from 5 years to 15 years. The effect of this change
in accounting estimate increased net income by $34,200 $01 per basic and
diluted share for the year ended January 31, 1997.
Additionally, depreciation of all property and equipment acquired during
the year ended January 31, 1997 has been computed using the straight-line
method. Depreciation of property and equipment acquired in prior years was
computed primarily using accelerated methods. The effect of this change
increased net income by $67,300 $02 per basic and diluted share for the
year ended January 31, 1997.                    37 4 Intangible Assets

commitment fees in connection with a new credit agreement entered into with
the Company bank. These fees will be amortized over the terms of the
respective borrowings on the straight-line method for the revolving portion
and the effective interest method for the term note portion of the
agreement.

its existing lenders including a line of credit in the amount of
$10,000,000 to fund purchases of existing outdoor advertising business
and/or billboard properties and a working capital line of $2,000,000. Each

arrangement totaling $1,000,000 which matured in May 1998 and interest was
payable monthly at the prime rate plus 1 percent. The Company had drawn
$745,000 as of January 31, 1998. Borrowings under this line of credit were
limited to six times the trailing cash flow from existing billboards not
financed by this facility less the balance outstanding on another note to
the bank. The line was secured by billboards and inventory.

and to provide funds for working capital.
8 Stockholders' Equity
In December 1996, the Company completed an initial public offering of
1,100,000 shares of common stock at $800 per share. Proceeds from the
offering, net of underwriter discounts and commissions and other offering
expenses, totaled approximately $7,300,000. The Company utilized a portion
of the net proceeds of the initial public offering to repay certain
indebtedness of the Company and plans to utilize the remaining balance for
general corporate purposes, including the acquisition or development of
additional travel centers and outdoor advertising operations.
Concurrent with the closing of the initial public offering, the Company
issued a five-year non-redeemable option to purchase up to 93,500 shares of
common stock at an exercise price equal to 120 percent of the offering
price, or $960 per share to the underwriter. The option became exercisable
in December 1997. As of January 31, 1999, the option has not been
exercised.
40   On November 12, 1996, the Company entered into an agreement with an outside
consultant whereby 98,537 shares of outstanding common stock were returned
to the Company without consideration, and the stock certificates were
canceled. The shares had been issued in April 1996, in exchange for
services rendered in connection with the initial public offering.
9 Stock Option Plan
On September 27, 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Stock Option Plan the
Plan pursuant to which the Company board of directors may grant stock
options to officers and key employees. The Plan authorizes grants of
options to purchase shares of authorized but unissued common stock up to an
amount equal to ten percent of issued and outstanding shares of common
stock 438,485 shares as of January 31, 1999. Stock options are granted
with an exercise price equal to the stock fair market value at the date
of grant. All stock options expire in ten years and vest, and become fully
exercisable as determined by the board at time of grant.
On September 27, 1996, the board of directors of the Company granted
options to purchase an aggregate of 338,000 shares of common stock to 62
employees and officers, and 6,000 shares to each of its four nonemployee
directors, effective as of the closing of the initial public offering. All
of the options granted provide for a three-year vesting period and have an
exercise price equal to or at 110 percent of the initial public offering
price of $800 weighted average exercise price of $822.
At January 31, 1999, there were 179,485 additional shares available for
grant under the Plan. The per share weighted-average fair value of stock
options granted during 1997 was $303 on the date of grant using the Black
Scholes  option-pricing  model  with the  following  weighted-average
assumptions: expected dividend yield 00 percent, expected volatility of 30
percent, risk-free interest rate of 615 percent, and an expected life of 5
years.
The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for its Plan and,
accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for its stock options
in the consolidated financial statements. Had the Company determined
compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant date for its stock
options under SFAS No. 123, the Company net income would have been
reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below for the years ended
January 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

January 31, 1997.
During the years ended January 31, 1999 and 1998, no options were granted,
exercised or expired, however, 42,500 and 60,500 options were forfeited,
respectively. Thus, 259,000 options are outstanding as of January 31, 1999.
During the year ended January 31, 1997, no options were exercised,
forfeited or expired.
At January 31, 1999, the range of exercise prices and weighted-average

1998, 1997 or 1996. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and
projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the
deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely
than not the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible
differences.
