Insight Enterprises, Inc.
Tempe, Arizona We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Insight
Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and
comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December31, 2003. These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Insight
Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2003 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.     /s/ KPMG LLP Phoenix, Arizona

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 1Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business We are a leading provider of information technology IT products and
services primarily to business customers in the United States, Canada and the
United Kingdom. Our offerings include brand name computing products, advanced
IT services and outsourcing of business processes. Our business is organized
in four operating segments   
Single-source provider of IT products and services North America Insight North America     
Single-source provider of IT products and services United Kingdom Insight UK     
Business process outsourcing provider Direct Alliance; and     
Internet service provider PlusNet. For a business overview, as well as discussions about the operating
strategy, growth strategy, industry and competition related to each of our
operating segments, see Business Operating Segments, in Item1. Acquisitions On April25, 2002, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Comark, a
leading provider of IT products and services in the United States. On October
8, 2001, we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of Action, a
United-Kingdom based direct marketer of IT products. Additionally, on October
1, 2001, we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of Kortex, a direct
marketer of IT products in Canada. Accordingly, we have included the results
of each of these acquisitions from their respective acquisition dates in our
consolidated results of operations. Principles of Consolidation and Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Insight
Enterprises, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements.
Additionally, these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of
sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Cash equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities at the
date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Inventories We state inventories, principally purchased computers, hardware and
software, at the lower of weighted average cost which approximates cost under
the first-in first-out method or market. We evaluate inventories for excess,
obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at
normal margins. Write-downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the
approximate net realizable value and take into account our contractual
provisions with suppliers governing price protection, stock rotation and return
privileges relating to obsolescence. Inventories not available for sale are related to product sales
transactions in which we are warehousing the product and will be deploying the
product to customers designated locations. Additionally, we may perform
advanced custom imaging and configuration services on a portion of the product
prior to shipment to our customers and will be paid a fee for doing so.
Although the product contracts are non-cancelable with terms of net 30 from the
date the inventories were segregated in our warehouse and invoiced to the
customer, and the warranty periods begin on the date of invoice, these
transactions do not generally meet the sales recognition criteria under GAAP.
Therefore, we have not recorded sales and the inventories remain recorded as
inventories not available for sale on our balance sheet until the product is
shipped to our customers. 43 Table of Contents Property and Equipment We state property and equipment at cost. We state equipment under capital
leases at the present value of the minimum lease payments. We capitalize major
improvements and betterments, while maintenance, repairs and minor replacements
are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line
method over the economic lives of the assets ranging from three to twenty-nine
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the underlying
lease term or asset life. The cost of computer software developed or obtained
for internal use, including internal costs incurred for upgrades and
enhancements that result in additional functionality, is capitalized and
amortized over its estimated useful life of three to ten years. Reviews are regularly performed to determine whether facts and
circumstances exist which indicate that the useful life is shorter than
originally estimated or the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable.
We assess the recoverability of our assets in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, by comparing the projected undiscounted net
cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their
remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any,
is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of
those assets. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net
assets acquired. Goodwill related to acquisitions prior to July1, 2002 was
amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected periods to be benefited,
generally 20years. We adopted SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, effective January1, 2002. SFAS No142 requires that goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but,
instead, be tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS No142 also requires
that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over the
respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Foreign Currency Translation The financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into
United States dollars in accordance with SFAS No52, Foreign Currency
Translation. Assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated into
United States dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet
dates. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate
for each month within the year. The resulting translation adjustments are
recorded directly in other comprehensive income as a separate component of
stockholders equity. All transaction gains or losses are recorded in the
consolidated statement of operations. These gains or losses were not material
in any of the years presented in the consolidated financial statements. Sales Recognition We adhere to guidelines and principles of sales recognition described in
Staff Accounting Bulletin No104, Revenue Recognition SAB 104, issued by
the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC. Under SAB
104, sales are recognized when the title and risk of loss are passed to the
customer, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale, delivery has
occurred and/or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed and
determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Using these tests, the
majority of our sales represent product sales recognized upon shipment. Usual
sales terms are FOB shipping point, at which time title and risk of loss has
passed to the customer and delivery has occurred. Additionally, sales of
services currently represent a very small percentage of our net sales, and the
majority of our services are performed in our facilities prior to shipment of
the product. In these circumstances, net sales for both the product and
services are recognized upon shipment. In other cases, net sales of services
are typically recorded as the services are performed. We make provisions for
estimated product returns that we expect to occur under our return policy based
upon historical return rates. From time to time, in the sale of products and services, we may enter into
contracts that contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions.
We recognize sales for delivered items only when all of the following criteria
are satisfied   
the delivered items has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis     
there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items; and     
if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the
delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is
considered probable and substantially in our control. Insight North America and Insight UK sell certain third-party service
contracts and software assurance or subscription products for which we are not
the primary obligor. These sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales
recognition as defined in SAB 104 and thus are recorded on a net sales
recognition basis. As we enter into contracts with third-party service 44 Table of Contents providers or vendors, we evaluate whether the subsequent sales of such
services should be recorded as gross sales or net sales in accordance with the
sales recognition criteria outlined in SAB 104 and Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an
Agent. We must determine whether we act as a principal in the transaction and
assume the risks and rewards of ownership or if we are simply acting as an
agent or broker. Under gross sales recognition, the entire selling price is
recorded in sales and our cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is
recorded in costs of goods sold. Under net sales recognition, the cost to the
third-party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction to sales
resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction and there
are no costs of goods sold. Direct Alliances outsourcing arrangements are primarily service fee based
whereby we derive net sales based primarily upon a cost plus arrangement in
which we earn a percentage of the sales price from products sold. These net
sales are recorded under the net sales recognition method. Also, as an
accommodation to select clients, Direct Alliance purchases product from
suppliers and immediately resells the product to clients for ultimate resale to
the clients customer. These product sales referred to as pass-through
product sales to our clients are transacted at little or no gross margin and
the selling price to our client is recorded in net sales with the cost payable
to the supplier recorded in cost of goods sold. PlusNets net sales are largely derived from subscriptions for access to
the Internet and other Internet service provider services. Net sales are
recognized over the life of the contract or as services are provided. Vendor Consideration We receive payments and credits from vendors, including consideration
pursuant to volume incentive programs and cooperative marketing programs.
Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No02-16, Accounting by
a Reseller for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor, which we adopted
January1, 2003, vendor consideration received pursuant to volume sales
incentive programs is classified as a reduction to costs of goods sold and is
recognized upon certain product volume thresholds being met. Cooperative
marketing programs, which represent a reimbursement of specific, incremental,
identifiable costs, are included as a reduction of the related selling and
administrative expenses in the period the program takes place. Consideration
that exceeds the specific, incremental, identifiable costs is classified as a
reduction of costs of goods sold. Additionally, vendor consideration based on
volume purchase incentives, rather than volume sales incentives, is also
allocated to inventories based on applicable incentives from each vendor. Shipping and Handling In accordance with EITF 00-10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees
and Costs, we record freight billed to our customers as net sales and the
related freight costs as costs of goods sold. Self Insurance We are self-insured for medical insurance benefits up to certain stop-loss
limits. Such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of
incurred, but not reported IBNRclaims. IBNR claims are estimated using
historical lag information and other data provided by claims administrators. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable earnings in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes
the enactment date. Net Earnings Loss Per Share Basic net earnings lossper share is computed by dividing net earnings
lossavailable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during each year. Diluted net earnings lossper
share includes the impact of stock options assumed to be exercised using the
treasury stock method. The denominator for diluted net earnings per share is
greater by 569,502 in 2003, equal to the denominator used in basic net earnings
lossper share in 2002 and greater by 927,799 shares in 2001. The number of
shares related to stock options excluded from the diluted net earnings per
share calculation is 3,162,065 in 2003 and 3,014,680 in 2001; the effects of
8,345,936 outstanding stock options have not been included in fiscal 2002
diluted net loss per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 45 Table of Contents Stock-Based Compensation We apply the intrinsic value-based method of accounting prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and related interpretations including FASB Interpretation
No44, Accounting for Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation an
interpretation of APB Opinion No25 to account for our stock-based employee
compensation plans. Under this method, compensation expense related to stock
options is recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of
the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price. SFAS No123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, established accounting and disclosure
requirements using a fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation plans. As allowed by SFAS No123, we have elected to
continue to apply the intrinsic value-based method of accounting described
above and have adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No123.
Accordingly, we do not recognize compensation expense for any of our stock
option plans because we do not issue stock options at exercise prices below the
market value at date of grant. Had compensation cost for our stock option
plans been determined consistent with SFAS No123, our net earnings lossand
net earnings lossper share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts
indicated below in thousands, except per share data

We recognize the compensation expense associated with the issuance of
restricted stock over the vesting period. The total compensation expense
associated with restricted stock represents the value based upon the number of
shares awarded multiplied by the closing price on the date of grant.
Recipients of restricted stock are entitled to receive any dividends declared
on our common stock and have voting rights, regardless of whether such shares
have vested. Unvested shares of restricted stock are forfeited if the
recipient resigns or is terminated without cause. Reclassifications Certain amounts in the 2002 and 2001 consolidated financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the 2003 presentation. 2Fair Value of Financial Instruments SFAS No107, Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,
requires that we disclose estimated fair values for our financial instruments.
The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents are assumed to be the fair
value because of the liquidity of these instruments. The carrying amounts for
accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current
liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these
instruments. 3Property and Equipment Property and equipment consist of the following in thousands

46 Table of Contents 4Goodwill and Goodwill Impairment Effective January1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, under which goodwill is no longer amortized but is tested
for impairment at a reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual
tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than
not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value amount.
Events or circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include a
significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate,
unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in the
manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall
business, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant
declines in our stock price for a sustained period or significant
underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of
operations. SFAS No142 defines a reporting unit as an operating segment or
one level below an operating segment. For purposes of financial reporting and
impairment testing in accordance with SFAS No142, we have determined that our
reporting units are the same as our operating segments: Insight North America,
Insight UK, Direct Alliance and PlusNet. See Note 17 for further discussion
about our operating segments. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we first compare the
estimated fair value of the reporting unit with book value, including goodwill.
If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to
be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value
of the reporting unit is less than book value, then we are required to compare
the carrying amount of the goodwill with its implied fair value. The estimate
of implied fair value of goodwill may require independent valuations of certain
internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as trademarks. If
the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that
goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the
excess. Goodwill was tested for impairment upon adoption of SFAS No142 as of
January1, 2002 with no resulting impairment of goodwill. We have elected to
test impairment annually in the fourth quarter for all reporting units and will
perform additional impairment tests when triggering events occur. The results
of the fourth quarter 2003 annual assessment indicated that the goodwill
amounts recorded at Insight North America and PlusNet, the only reporting units
with goodwill, were not impaired. Based on results of the fourth quarter 2002
annual assessment, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of
$91,587,000, $88,427,000 net of taxes, which represented the entire goodwill
balance recorded at Insight UK. Due to the non-amortization of goodwill, our reported results for 2001 are
not comparable with 2002 and 2003. The following table is a reconciliation of
previously reported net earnings to net earnings, excluding goodwill

Certain agreements related to our acquisitions contain provisions that
require us to make contingent payments based upon profitability of the acquired
operations or if specific minimum revenue requirements are met. These
provisions are based on various performance measures through December31, 2003.
During fiscal 2003, contingent payments of $1,764,000 47 Table of Contents related to the acquisitions of Comark and Kortex were determined, paid and
recorded as increases to goodwill. A final contingent payment, related to the
acquisition of Comark, of up to $2,000,000 will be determined, paid and
recorded as goodwill in 2004. 5Financing Facilities Our financing facilities include a $200,000,000 accounts receivable
securitization financing arrangement, a $30,000,000 revolving line of credit
and a $40,000,000 inventory financing facility. We have an agreement to sell receivables periodically to a special purpose
accounts receivable and financing entity the SPE, which is exclusively
engaged in purchasing receivables from us. The SPE is a wholly-owned,
bankruptcy-remote entity that we have included in our Consolidated Financial
Statements. The SPE funds its purchases by selling undivided interests in up
to $200million of eligible trade accounts receivable to a multi-seller conduit
administered by an independent financial institution. The sales to the conduit
do not qualify for sale treatment under SFAS No140 Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities as we
maintain effective control over the receivables that are sold. Accordingly,
the accounts receivable remain recorded on our Consolidated Financial
Statements. At December31, 2003, the SPE owned $323,470,000 of accounts
receivable that are recorded at fair value and are included in our consolidated
balance sheet, of which $163,520,000 was eligible for funding. The original
financing arrangement expired December30, 2003 and although terms of up to
three years were available to us, we elected to renew the financing arrangement
for one year based on available pricing. Accordingly, the renewed financing
arrangement expires December30, 2004 and the $55,000,000 outstanding at
December31, 2003 is recorded as short-term debt. Interest is payable monthly
and the interest rate on borrowed funds as of December31, 2003 was 167%. We
also pay a commitment fee on the facility equal to 035% of the unused balance.
At December31, 2003, $108,520,000 was available under the facility. We have
no reason to believe the facility will not be renewed at the end of its current
term. As of December31, 2003, we had $10,004,000 outstanding under our
$30,000,000 revolving line of credit. The line of credit bears interest,
payable quarterly, at a rate chosen by us among available rates subject to our
leverage ratio and other terms and conditions. The available rates are the
financial institutions floating rate or the LIBOR based rate 555% and 267 respectively at December31, 2003. Amounts outstanding are recorded as
long-term liabilities. The credit facility expires on December31, 2005. We
have an outstanding letter of credit that reduces the availability on this line
of credit by $10,000,000. At December31, 2003, $9,996,000 was available under
the line of credit. Our $40,000,000 secured inventories facility can be used to facilitate the
purchases of inventories from certain suppliers and amounts outstanding are
classified on the balance sheet as accounts payable. As of December31, 2003,
there was $5,600,000 outstanding under the inventories facility and $34,400,000
was available. This facility is non-interest bearing if paid within its terms
and expires December31, 2005. Our facilities contain various covenants including the requirement that we
maintain a specified amount of tangible net worth and comply with leverage and
minimum fixed charge requirements. We were in compliance with all such
covenants at December31, 2003. 6Long-Term Debt Long-term debt consists of the following in thousands

2004. At December31, 2003, this furniture under lease is recorded in
furniture and fixtures at a book value of $725,000, net of accumulated
depreciation of $1,203,000. We have several non-cancelable operating leases with third-parties,
primarily for administrative and distribution center space and computer
equipment. Rental expense for these third-party operating leases was
$8,766,000, $7,340,000, and $4,115,000 for the years ended December31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. We lease an office facility in Bloomingdale, Illinois under an operating
lease agreement. The facility is owned by a company whose owners are the
former owners of Comark, who have employment agreements with us through June
2004. Rental expense for this related party operating lease was $1,000,000 and
$596,000 for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases with

At December31, 2003, United States income taxes have not been provided on
the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the United States.
These earnings, which are considered to be invested indefinitely, would become
subject to United States income tax if they were remitted as dividends, were
lent to us, or if we were to sell our stock in the subsidiaries. The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as

The net current deferred tax asset is included in deferred income taxes
and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets for December31,
2003 and 2002. At December31, 2003 and December31, 2002, we had deferred tax assets of
$15,738,000 and $12,958,000, respectively, relating to foreign net operating
loss, foreign depreciation allowance and capital loss carryforwards. The
carryforwards do not expire but are restricted in the manner in which they are
utilized pursuant to applicable jurisdiction requirements. We have provided
valuation allowances at December31, 2003 and December31, 2002 of $14,267,000
and $10,665,000, respectively, representing the portions of the carryforwards
that we believe is not more likely than not to be realized due to the
restrictions. At 50 Table of Contents December31, 2002, we recorded a deferred tax asset for the estimated
future deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge. The balance of
this deferred tax asset at December31, 2003 is $2,894,000, net of a valuation
allowance of $1,353,000. The increase in the valuation allowance from December31, 2002 to December
31, 2003 is attributed primarily to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
of $1,934,000, additions of $1,341,000 due to increased foreign depreciation
allowances, and a $513,000 addition due to capital losses. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be
reduced or increased depending on forecasted earnings by jurisdiction,
historical and projected taxable income, prudent and feasible tax planning
strategies and statutory tax law changes. In the future, if we determine that
additional realization of these deferred tax assets is more likely than not,
the reversal of the related valuation allowance will reduce income tax expense. Tax benefits of $1,912,000 in 2003, $5,200,000 in 2002, and $3,756,000 in
2001 related to the exercise of employee stock options and other employee stock
programs were applied to stockholders equity. The domestic and foreign components of earnings lossesbefore income
taxes were as follows in thousands

9Benefit Plans We have adopted a defined contribution benefit plan the Defined
Contribution Plan which complies with section 401k of the Internal Revenue
Code. Under the Defined Contribution Plan, we currently match 25% of the
employees pre-tax contributions up to a maximum 6% of eligible compensation.
Contribution expense under this plan was $1,584,000, $792,000, and $654,000 for
the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Until February3, 2003, we had an additional defined contribution benefit
plan assumed in an acquisition, which also complied with section 401k of the
Internal Revenue Code. Under this plan, we matched 100% of employees pre-tax
contributions up to a maximum 2% of eligible compensation. Effective February
3, 2003, we merged the acquired plan into the Defined Contribution Plan and
simultaneously moved administration of the Defined Contribution Plan to a new
service provider and amended certain plan provisions. Contribution expense
under the acquired plan was $667,000 for the 8-month period ended December31,
2002 and $0 for the year ended December31, 2003. All employer matching
contributions for the year ended December31, 2003 were contributed to Defined
Contribution Plan. In August1995, we adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase
Plan. Under the terms of the Purchase Plan, employees other than officers
may purchase a total of up to 506,250 shares of common stock. The purchase
price per share is 85% of the market value per share of common stock determined
as of the beginning of the quarterly purchase period as specified in the
Purchase Plan. As of December31, 2003, 376,596 shares have been issued under
the Purchase Plan and 129,654 shares are available for issuance. 10Stock Plans We have various long-term incentive plans the Plans including stock
option and restricted stock plans in Insight Enterprises, Inc. and stock option
plans in the following subsidiaries: Direct Alliance and PlusNet Technologies
collectively, the Subsidiary Plans. The purpose of the Plans is to benefit
and advance our interests by rewarding officers, directors and certain
employees for their contributions to our success and therefore motivating them
to continue to make such contributions in the future. The Plans provide for
fixed grants of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options and
restricted stock grants. The stock options generally vest over a one to five
year period from the date of grant and expire 5 to 10years after the date of
grant. Company Plans In November1994, the stockholders approved the establishment of the 1994
Stock Option Plan the 1994 Plan. The 1994 Plan provides for the grant to
executive officers, other key employees, non-employee directors and consultants
of either incentive stock options, within the meaning of Section422 of the
Code, or nonqualified stock options. Under the 1994 Plan, only employees
including officers are eligible to receive incentive stock options. The 1994
Plan is administered by the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board,
which determines the terms of options granted under the 1994 Plan, including
the 51 Table of Contents exercise price and the number of shares subject to the option. The 1994 Plan
provides the Board of Directors with the discretion to determine when options
granted thereunder shall become exercisable. Stock options available for grant
under the 1994 Plan are included in the total shares of common stock available
to grant for awards under the 1998 LTIP, 1994 Plan or 1999 Broad Based Plan
discussed under the 1998 LTIP below. In October1997, the stockholders approved the establishment of the 1998
Long-Term Incentive Plan the 1998 LTIP for officers, employees, directors
and consultants or independent contractors. The 1998 LTIP authorizes grants of
incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation
rights, performance shares, restricted common stock and performance-based
awards. Effective March13, 2001, the stockholders approved an amendment to
the 1998 LTIP increasing the number of shares eligible for awards to 6,000,000.
In addition, the Board of Directors has reserved additional shares such that
the number of shares of common stock remaining for grant under the 1998 LTIP
and any of our other option plans, plus the number of shares of common stock
granted but not yet exercised under the 1998 LTIP and any of our other option
plans, shall not exceed 20% of the outstanding shares of our common stock at
the time of calculation of the additional shares. As of December31, 2003,
there were 1,996,263 total shares of common stock available to grant for awards
under the 1998 LTIP, 1994 Plan and 1999 Broad Based Employee Stock Option Plan. In September1998, we established the 1998 Employee Restricted Stock Plan
the 1998 Employee RSP for our employees. The total number of restricted
common stock shares initially available for grant under the 1998 Employee RSP
was 562,500 and as of December31, 2003, 434,417 shares of restricted common
stock shares were available for grant. In December1998, we established the 1998 Officer Restricted Stock Plan
the 1998 Officer RSP for our officers. The total number of restricted
common stock shares initially available for grant under the 1998 Officer RSP
was 56,250 and as of December31, 2003, 490 shares of restricted common stock
were available for grant. In September1999, we established the 1999 Broad Based Employee Stock
Option Plan the 1999 Broad Based Plan for our employees. The total number
of stock options initially available for grant under the 1999 Broad Based Plan
is 1,500,000; provided, however, that no more than 20% of the shares of stock
available under the 1999 Broad Based Plan may be awarded to the Officers.
Stock options available for grant under the 1999 Broad Based Plan are included
in the total shares of common stock available to grant for awards under the
1998 LTIP, 1994 Plan or 1999 Broad Based Plan discussed under the 1998 LTIP
above. The 1994 Plan, 1998 LTIP, 1998 Employee RSP, 1998 Officer RSP and 1999
Broad Based Plan the Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee
of the Board of Directors. Except as provided below, the Compensation
Committee has the exclusive authority to administer the Plans, including the
power to determine eligibility, the types of awards to be granted, the price
and the timing of awards. The Plans do, however, provide that our CEO has the
authority to grant awards to any individual other than the three
highest-ranking executives and provides further that any grant to an
individual who is subject to Section16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
may not be exercisable for at least six months from the date of grant. Generally, options granted expire in five to ten years, are exercisable
during the optionees lifetime only by the recipient and are non-transferable.
Unexercised options generally terminate seven days after an individual ceases
to be an employee. We have issued shares of restricted common stock as incentives to certain
officers and employees. The shares of restricted common stock are valued at
the date of grant and are amortized over the three-year vesting period. At
December31, 2003, there were 9,578 shares of restricted common stock
outstanding, which represents $61,612 of unamortized deferred compensation.
This balance is recorded as additional paid-in capital. For purposes of the SFAS No123 pro forma net earnings lossand net
earnings lossper share calculation, the fair value of each option grant is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants under the Plans
in 2003, 2002 and 2001

Subsidiary Plans In May2000, we established the Direct Alliance Corporation 2000 Long-Term
Incentive Plan Direct Alliance 2000 LTIP, the PlusNet Technologies Limited
2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan PlusNet 2000 LTIP and the Insight ASP Limited
2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan Insight ASP 2000 LTIP. The total number of
stock options initially available for grant under these plans, representing 15%
of the outstanding shares of the subsidiaries common stock, is: Direct
Alliance 2000 LTIP 4,500,000, PlusNet 2000 LTIP 7,500,000 and Insight ASP
2000 LTIP 7,500,000. During 2002, the Insight ASP 2000 LTIP was terminated
and all of the options were cancelled. As of December31, 2003, the number of
stock options available for grant under these plans is: Direct Alliance 2000
LTIP 1,722,500 and PlusNet 2000 LTIP 2,935,500. Subsidiary Plans, which are currently administered by the respective
subsidiarys Board of Directors, include provisions for granting of incentive
awards in the form of stock options to the subsidiarys employees and directors
as well as to officers and employees of its parent and corporate affiliates. The right to purchase shares under the stock option agreements with the
subsidiarys employees and directors vest 100% on May5, 2005 and expire on May
5, 2006. The vesting and exercisability of the options accelerate in the event
of an initial public offering or change of control of the subsidiary or of
Insight Enterprises, Inc. Unexercised options terminate seven days after an
individual ceases to be an employee. The right to purchase shares under the stock option agreements with
officers or employees of its parent or corporate affiliates are 100% vested on
the date of grant, however, are not exercisable until May5, 2005 and expire on
May5, 2006. The exercisability of these options accelerates in the event of
an initial public offering or change of control of the subsidiary or us.
Unexercised options do not terminate after an individual ceases to be an
employee. 53 Table of Contents For purposes of the SFAS No123 pro forma net earnings lossand net
earnings lossper share calculation, the fair value of the 2002 PlusNet
option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for
grants under the Subsidiary Plans: expected volatility and dividend yield of
0%, risk-free interest rate of 24% and expected lives of 24years. The following table summarizes the stock option activity under the

Exercise prices in the PlusNet grant agreements are designated in British
pound sterling. Amounts represented in the table are based on the exchange
rates on the date of grant. 11Stockholder Rights Agreement On December14, 1998, each stockholder of record received one Preferred
Share Purchase Right Right on each outstanding share of common stock owned.
Each Right entitles stockholders to buy 00148 of a share of our SeriesA
Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $8888. The Rights will be exercisable
if a person or group acquires 15% or more of our common stock or announces a
tender offer for 15% or more of the common stock. Should this occur, the Right
will entitle its holder to purchase, at the Rights exercise price, a number of
shares of common stock having a market value at the time of twice the Rights
exercise price. Rights held by the 15% holder will become void and will not be
exercisable to purchase shares at the bargain purchase price. If we are
acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a person
acquires 15% or more of the our common stock, each Right will entitle its
holder to purchase at the Rights then current exercise price a number of the
acquiring companys common shares having a market value at the time of twice
the Rights exercise price. 12Non-Operating Expense, Net Non-operating expense, net consists primarily of interest expense and
interest income. Interest expense of $2,629,000 and $3,569,000 in 2003 and
2002, respectively, primarily relates to borrowings under our credit
facilities, which were used to finance an acquisition during 2002. Interest
expense has decreased due to decreases in interest-bearing debt incurred and
assumed in connection with the acquisition and decreases in interest rates.
Interest income of $885,000 and $386,000 in 2003 and 2002, respectively, was
generated through short-term investments. The increase in interest income in
2003 is due to the increase in cash invested in the United Kingdom at higher
interest rates than the United States, offset partially by declining interest
rates on short-term investments in the United States. Non-operating expenses,
other than interest expense, of $2,655,000 and $1,404,000 in 2003 and 2002,
respectively, consist primarily of bank fees associated with financing
arrangements and cash management. The increase in other non-operating expense
in 2003 is due primarily to prepayment penalties of $628,000 and written off
capitalized loan origination fees of $173,000 associated with the prepayment of
building mortgages in 2003. 13Reductions in Liabilities Assumed in Previous Acquisition During the year ended December31, 2003, Insight UK settled certain
liabilities assumed in the acquisition of Action in late 2001 for $2,504,000
less than the amounts originally recorded. Normally, these items would be
recorded as a reduction to goodwill. However, Insight UK recorded a goodwill
impairment charge during the fourth quarter of 2002 which eliminated its entire
goodwill balance; therefore, the reduction in assumed liabilities is recorded
in the statement of operations. The income resulting from the reduction in
assumed liabilities was not taxable. See Note 4 for further discussion about
the goodwill impairment. 14Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Activities Acquisition-Related Restructuring Costs Expensed in 2003 During the year ended December31, 2003, Insight North America recorded
$2,283,000 in restructuring expenses associated with costs incurred to close
Insight North Americas distribution facility in Indiana and $639,000 in
connection with the elimination of certain support and management positions.
The Indiana facility was closed in order to consolidate warehouse and
distribution facilities in Illinois in accordance with the Comark integration
plan. The restructuring expenses generally consist of employee termination
benefits of $820,000, facilities based expenses of $954,000, and non-cash
expenses related to abandoned assets of $1,148,000. The facilities based
expenses consist of remaining lease obligations and expenses to remove
leasehold improvements. Of the $954,000 recorded for facilities based
expenses, $531,000 was paid and adjustments of $35,000, due to increases in
estimated common area maintenance charges offset by reductions in estimated
accruals, were made leaving an accrual of $458,000 at December31, 2003, which
we expect to pay in 2004. The employee termination benefits relate to
severance and termination benefits paid during the year ended December31, 2003
to 109 employees. Also during the year ended December31, 2003, Insight UK recorded $543,000
of restructuring expenses relating to severance associated with the elimination
of service technicians and certain support and management functions. These
expenses generally consist of employee termination benefits for 26 employees.
During the year ended December31, 2003, $329,000 was paid and adjustments of
$168,000, due to decreases in estimated severance costs, were made leaving an
accrual of $46,000 at December31, 2003. We expect to pay the remaining
liabilities during 2004. 55 Table of Contents We recorded the restructuring expenses in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities or SFAS No112, Employers
Accounting for Post-Employment Benefits, as appropriate. The following table details the changes in restructuring liabilities

The write-off of abandoned assets of $1,148,000 is not included in the table
above as this was a non-cash expense. Acquisition-Related Restructuring Costs Capitalized in 2002 as a Cost of
Acquisition of Comark During 2002, Insight North America recorded $1,819,000 of restructuring
costs in connection with the integration of Comark. These costs were accounted
for under EITF Issue No95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with
Purchase Business Combinations. The acquisition-related restructuring costs
recorded in 2002 were based on the restructuring plans that were committed to
by management in 2002. Accordingly, these costs were recognized as liabilities
assumed in the purchase business combination and included in the allocation of
the costs to acquire Comark. The charge of $1,819,000 to restructure the organization consisted of
employee termination benefits and facilities based costs, of which $595,000 was
still accrued at December31, 2002. During the year ended December31, 2003,
an additional accrual was made to the employee termination benefits related to
severance payments and transition bonuses of $1,083,000 for 29 additional
employees who were terminated in connection with the elimination of certain
duplicative activities resulting from the acquisition. These adjustments were
offset by cash payments of $1,583,000. Additional facilities based costs of
$19,000 were accrued during the year related to lease termination costs
associated with vacating duplicate facilities. The cash payments for
facilities based costs during the year ended December31, 2003 were $114,000. The following table details the changes in these liabilities during the
year ended December31, 2003 in thousands

Acquisition-Related Restructuring Costs Capitalized in 2001 as a Cost of
Acquisition of Action In 2001, Insight UK recorded costs of $18,440,000 relating to
restructuring the operations of Action as part of the integration of this
acquisition. These costs were accounted for under EITF Issue No95-3,
Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with Purchase Business Combinations.
The acquisition-related restructuring costs recorded in 2001 were based on the
restructuring plans that were committed to by management in 2001. Accordingly,
these costs were recognized as liabilities assumed in the purchase business
combination and included in the allocation of the costs to acquire Action.
Normally, adjustments to these amounts, other than foreign currency
translation, would be recorded as a reduction to goodwill. However, Insight UK
recorded a goodwill impairment charge during the fourth quarter of 2002 which
eliminated its entire goodwill balance; therefore, any adjustments in assumed
liabilities, other than foreign currency translation, are recorded in the
statement of operations in the line item reductions in liabilities assumed in
previous acquisition. Foreign currency translation adjustments continue to be
recorded directly in other comprehensive income as a separate component of
stockholders equity. 56 Table of Contents The $18,440,000 cost to restructure the organization consisted of employee
termination benefits and facilities based costs of $3,532,000 and $14,908,000,
respectively, of which $9,721,000 remained accrued at December31, 2002.
Employee termination benefits of $11,000 were paid during the year ended
December31, 2003. Adjustments to the accrued employee termination benefits of
$231,000 during the year ended December31, 2003 primarily represented
decreases in estimated employee termination benefits. The facilities based
costs primarily consist of remaining lease commitments on unused facilities or
estimated costs to terminate lease commitments, reduced by estimated subleases.
Adjustments to the accrued facilities based costs during the year ended
December31, 2003 of $884,000 primarily represent fluctuations in the British
pound sterling exchange rates. Facilities based costs of $1,246,000 were paid
during the year ended December31, 2003, resulting in an ending accrual balance
at December31, 2003 of $9,117,000. Although the facilities based costs
represent contractual payments under long-term leases, we are actively pursuing
opportunities to negotiate out of these leases and have recorded the
obligations as current accrued liabilities. The following table details the change in these liabilities for the year
ended December31, 2003 in thousands

Acquisition-Related Restructuring Costs Expensed in Fiscal 2001 In 2001, we recorded expenses relating to restructuring our existing
operations as part of the integration of the acquisitions of Action and Kortex.
The costs were accounted for under EITF Issue No94-3, Liability Recognition
for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
and have been included as a charge to the results of operations for the year
ended December31, 2001. Accordingly, these costs were recorded based on the
restructuring plans that were committed to by management in 2001. The $3,653,000 charge to restructure the organization in 2001 consisted of
employee termination benefits and facilities based expenses of $2,641,000 and
$1,012,000, respectively. At December31, 2002, facilities based costs of
$279,000 and $19,000 remained accrued at Insight North America and Insight UK,
respectively. The facilities based costs primarily consist of remaining lease
commitments on unused facilities or estimated costs to terminate lease
commitments. During the year ended December31, 2003, facilities based costs
of $91,000 were paid and adjustments of $178,000 were recorded due to decreases
in estimated lease termination costs, resulting in an ending accrual for
Insight North America of $10,000 at December31, 2003. We expect to pay the
remaining liabilities during 2004. At December31, 2003, facilities based costs of $19,000 remained accrued
at Insight UK as there were no cash payments or adjustments made to the lease
commitments associated with UK facilities that are no longer in use. We expect
to pay the remaining liabilities during 2004. The following table details the changes in the facilities based costs

15Contingencies Employment Contracts We have employment agreements with certain officers and employees under
which severance payments would become payable in the event of specified
terminations without cause or pursuant to a change in control. In the event
the severance 57 Table of Contents payments under the current employment agreements were to become payable,
the maximum contingent severance payment calculated as of December31, 2003
would be approximately $18,300,000. Legal Proceedings We are a defendant in a lawsuit, which is a consolidation of three
separate actions brought by stockholders, pending in the United States District
Court, District of Arizona. The lawsuit alleges violations of Section 10b of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule10b-5. The plaintiffs in this
action allege we, and certain of our officers, made false and misleading
statements pertaining to our business, operations and management in an effort
to inflate the price of our common stock. The lawsuit also names as
co-defendants: Eric J. Crown, the Chairman of our Board of Directors; Timothy
A. Crown, our Chief Executive Officer and President and a director; and Stanley
Laybourne, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
and a director. The plaintiffs seek class action status to represent all
buyers of our common stock from September3, 2001 through July17, 2002. On
September27, 2003, the court granted our motion to dismiss plaintiffs amended
complaint, but allowed plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint, which
they did on October31, 2003. On January9, 2004, we filed a motion to dismiss
the second amended complaint, and the Court will hear oral argument on the
motion to dismiss on May3, 2004. We will continue to defend the case
vigorously. The costs associated with defending the allegations in this
lawsuit and the potential outcome cannot be determined at this time and,
accordingly, no estimate for such costs, other than the deductible amount under
our directors and officers liability insurance policies has been included in
these Consolidated Financial Statements. We are also a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary
course of business, including asserted preference payment claims in customer
bankruptcy proceedings and claims of alleged infringement of patents,
trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. In accordance with SFAS No5, Accounting for Contingencies, we make a
provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These
provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts
of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other
information and events pertaining to a particular case. Although litigation is
inherently unpredictable, we believe that we have adequate provisions for any
probable and estimable losses. It is possible, nevertheless, that the results
of our operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected in
any particular period by the resolution of a legal proceeding. Contingent Acquisition Payments Our acquisition of Comark included provisions that require us to make
contingent payments based upon profitability of the acquired operations through
December31, 2003. Contingent payments are recognized when determined and are
recorded as increases to goodwill. A final contingent payment, related to the
acquisition of Comark, of up to $2,000,000 will be determined, paid and
recorded as goodwill in 2004. 16Supplemental Financial Information A summary of additions and deductions related to the allowances for

17Segment Information SFAS No131 requires disclosures of certain information regarding
operating segments, products and services, geographic areas of operation and
major customers. The method for determining what information to report under
SFAS No131 is based upon the management approach, or the way that
management organizes the operating segments within a company, for which
separate financial information if available that is evaluated regularly by the
Chief Operating Decision 58 Table of Contents Maker CODM in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer. We have the following reportable operating segments   
Single-source provider of IT products and services North America Insight North America     
Single-source provider of IT products and services United Kingdom Insight UK     
Business process outsourcing provider Direct Alliance; and     
Internet service provider PlusNet. All intercompany transactions are eliminated upon consolidation and there
are no differences between the accounting policies used to measure profit and
loss for our segments and on a consolidated basis. Net sales are defined as
net sales from external customers. None of our customers exceeded ten percent
of consolidated net sales. Insight North America, Insight UK and PlusNet have been disclosed below as
separate operating segments for all periods presented to conform to their
current reportable segment designation. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2002,
the results of Insight North America, Insight UK and PlusNet were included in
one segment, commonly referred to as Insight. Insight Germany is not a
segment as its operations were closed in the fourth quarter of 2001, but is
included for comparative information only.

Although we could be impacted by the international economic climate,
management does not believe material credit risk existed at December31, 2003.
We monitor our customers financial conditions and do not require collateral.
Historically, we have not experienced significant losses related to accounts
receivables from any individual or groups of customers. 18Subsequent Event On February9, 2004, Insight UK settled certain liabilities assumed in the
acquisition of Action in late 2001 for approximately $3,160,000 less than the
amounts originally recorded. Normally, these items would be recorded as a
reduction to goodwill. However, Insight UK recorded a goodwill impairment
charge during the fourth quarter of 2002 which eliminated its entire goodwill
balance; therefore, the reduction in assumed liabilities will be recorded in
the statement of operations in the first quarter of 2004. The income resulting
from the reduction in assumed liabilities will not be taxable. See Note 4 for
further discussion about the goodwill impairment. 60 Table of Contents
