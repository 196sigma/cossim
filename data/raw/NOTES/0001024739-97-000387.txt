The provision for income taxes was comprised of the following  
1997        1996        1995
Federal:
Current                        $2,133,400     $2,128,000      $1,473,700

Provision for income taxes                $2,614,800     $2,327,000      $1,558,600
Total deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of March 28, 1997 and
March 29, 1996, and the sources of the differences between financial accounting
and tax basis of the Company assets and liabilities which give rise to the
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows  
1997        1996
Deferred tax assets:
Property, equipment and capital leases           $212,000      $134,500
Accrued expenses and reserves                376,100       297,800
Other assets                          8,600        9,600
$596,700      $441,900
Deferred tax liabilities:
Prepaid expenses                      $   --      $ 17,200
Other assets                          8,200       56,200
$  8,200      $ 73,400
NOTE 6. Profit-Sharing Plan:
The Company has implemented a 401k profit sharing plan that covers all
eligible employees. Contributions to the plan are made at the discretion of the
Company Board of Directors. The Company contribution to the plan during
fiscal years 1997, 1996 and 1995 totaled $87,000, $47,200 and $69,800,
respectively.
NOTE 7. Asset Purchase:
During fiscal year 1997, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain
liabilities of Cincinnati, Ohio-based Cartwright Communications. The transaction
was valued at $3,988,000 plus the net value of inventory, receivables and
payables. The purchase was for cash and the assumption of certain liabilities.
The goodwill associated with this transaction is being amortized over 15 years. NOTE 8. Earnings Per Share Primary and fully diluted earnings per share were computed based on the weighted
average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding. The dilutive
effect of all options outstanding has been determined by using the treasury
stock method. The weighted average shares outstanding is calculated as follows  
1997          1996         1995
Common stock                      4,287,000       4,159,300      3,447,700
Effect of dilutive common equivalent shares        416,800        395,900       386,300
Primary weighted average shares outstanding       4,703,800       4,555,200      3,834,000
Effect of change in share price              15,400         36,100        60,200
Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding    4,719,200       4,591,300      3,894,200
The effect of change in share price above represents the impact on the
treasury stock method of the difference between the average share price during
the year and the year-end share price.
In March 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 128
Earnings Per Share. SFAS No. 128 simplifies the standards for computing
earnings per share previously found in APB No. 15, Earnings Per Share. It
replaces the presentation of primary EPS with a presentation of basic EPS and
requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS
calculation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS calculation.
Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to
common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted EPS is computed similarly to fully diluted EPS pursuant
to APB Opinion No. 15.
SFAS No. 128 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 1997, and
early adoption is not permitted. When adopted, it will require restatement of
prior years' EPS. When adopted for the year ended March 27, 1998, the Company
will report basic EPS instead of primary EPS. Basic EPS for the years ended
March 28, 1997 and March 29, 1996 is $097 and $097, respectively.
NOTE 9. Stock Based Compensation:
The Company has two stock option plans -- the 1984 Employee Incentive Stock
Option Plan the 1984 Plan and the 1994 Stock and Incentive Plan the 1994
Plan. Under the 1984 Plan and 1994 Plan, options for a maximum of 401,250 and
633,000 shares, respectively, may be granted at prices not less than 100% of the
fair market value at the date of option grant and for a term of not greater than
ten years. The 1994 Plan also allows for the granting of non-qualified options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, and
other performance awards, none of which have been granted as of March 28, 1997.
Transactions involving options and warrants are summarized as follows  
1997             1996            1995

The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for the plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost
has been recognized for its stock option plans. Had compensation cost for the
Company stock option plans been determined based on fair value at the grant
dates for grants under the plans consistent with the methodology of SFAS 123,
the Company net earnings and earnings per share for fiscal years 1997 and 1996
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated as follows  
1997        1996
Net earnings in thousands    As reported        $4,178       $4,041
Pro forma          3,786        3,888
Fully diluted earnings per share  As reported        $ 089       $ 088
Pro forma         $ 080       $ 085
The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions used for
grants in fiscal years 1997 and 1996  
1997        1996
Dividend yield                          0%          0%
Expected volatility                      536%        445%
Risk-free interest rate                     65%         60 Expected lives                        8 years       8 years
Pro forma net income reflects only options granted in fiscal 1996 and fiscal
1997. Therefore, the full impact of calculating compensation cost for stock
options under SFAS123 is not reflected in the pro forma net income amounts
presented above because compensation cost is reflected over the options' vesting
period of four years and compensation cost for options granted prior to March
31, 1995 is not considered.
NOTE 10. Restructuring Charge:
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company determined that it would
consolidate its Maryland facilities. Currently, the Company has a lease for its
corporate headquarters that expires on December 31, 2000. Based on the current
monthly payments and the expected sublease rate the Company will receive after
vacating its current corporate headquarters, the Company recorded a $310,200
restructuring charge in its fiscal 1997 Statement of Income. Management Responsibility for Financial Statements

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
TESSCO Technologies Incorporated   We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of TESSCO Technologies
Incorporated as of March 28, 1997 and March 29, 1996, and the related

the years ended March 28, 1997, March 29, 1996 and March 31, 1995. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of TESSCO Technologies
Incorporated as of March 28, 1997 and March 29, 1996, and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for the years ended March 28, 1997, March
29, 1996 and March 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. Schedule II is presented for
purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission rules
and is not part of the basic financial statements. The schedule has been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic
financial statements, and, in our opinion, fairly states in all material
respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in relation to
the basic financial statements taken as a whole.                          /s/ Arthur Andersen LLP
