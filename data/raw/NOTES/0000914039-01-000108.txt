REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of TransAct Technologies Incorporated
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of cash flows and of changes in
shareholders' equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of TransAct Technologies Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December
31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, which require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for the opinion expressed above. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

operating as a stand-alone, publicly-held company in August 1996 to conduct
the printer business that was formerly operated by certain subsidiaries of
Tridex Corporation Tridex.
2. BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS: TransAct, through its two operations, one in
Wallingford, CT and the other in Ithaca, NY, operates in one industry
segment, transaction-based printers and related products. TransAct designs,
develops, manufactures and markets transaction-based printers and related
products under the IthacaR, MagnetecR and TransAct.com brand
names. The Company printers are used worldwide to provide transaction
records such as receipts, tickets, coupons, register journals and other
documents. The Company focuses on five vertical markets: point-of-sale
POS, gaming and lottery, financial services, kiosk and Internet. The
Company sells its products directly to end users, original equipment
manufacturers OEM, value-added resellers and selected distributors,
primarily in the United States, Canada, Europe and Latin America.
TransAct designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad array of
transaction-based printers utilizing inkjet, thermal and impact printing
technology for applications requiring up to 60 character columns in each of
its vertical markets. The Company printers are configurable, which offer
customers the ability to choose from a variety of features and functions.
Options typically include PC board configuration, paper cutting devices,
paper handling capacities and number of print stations. In addition to its
configurable printers, TransAct manufactures custom printers for certain
OEM customers. In collaboration with these customers, the Company provides
engineering and manufacturing expertise for the design and development of
specialized printers.
USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates have been made
in areas including inventory valuation, estimated lives of fixed assets and
goodwill, deferred tax assets, accrued liabilities, allowance for doubtful
accounts and tax provisions benefits. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, after elimination of all material intercompany accounts and
transactions.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with a maturity date of three months or less at date of
purchase to be cash equivalents.
INVENTORIES: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally
standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out
basis or market.
FIXED ASSETS: Fixed assets are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided
for primarily by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful life of machinery, furniture and equipment is three to
ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the
term of the lease or the useful life of the asset. Depreciation amounted to
$2,176,000, $1,699,000 and $1,546,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.                    23

2. BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
GOODWILL: Goodwill resulted from the acquisition of i Ithaca
Peripherals, Inc. in 1991 and the ii ribbon business formerly conducted
by Tridex Tridex Ribbon Business in 1999. The original amount
applicable to the Ithaca acquisition totaled $3,536,000 and is being
amortized on the straight-line method over 20 years. The original amount
applicable to the Tridex Ribbon Business acquisition totaled $180,000 and
is being amortized on the straight-line method over five years. Accumulated
amortization of goodwill was $2,038,000 and $1,830,000 at December 31, 2000
and 1999, respectively. The Company periodically reviews goodwill to assess
recoverability based upon expectations of non-discounted cash flows from
operations of the acquired businesses. The Company believes that no
impairment of goodwill exists at December 31, 2000.
REVENUE RECOGNITION: Sales are recognized when evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the selling price is fixed and
determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue from
extended warranty and maintenance agreements is recognized over the term of
such agreements as services are performed. Sales to GTECH Corporation
GTECH for lottery printers and ICL Pathway for the British Post
Office project accounted for approximately 22% and 20% of net sales during
2000, respectively. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net
sales during 1999. Sales to one customer, GTECH, accounted for
approximately 32% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 1998.
FOREIGN CURRENCY: The financial position and results of operations of
the Company foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the
functional currency. Assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries have been
translated at end of period exchange rates, and related revenues and
expenses have been translated at weighted average exchange rates.
Transaction gains losses are included in other income and amounted to
$26,000, $11,000 and 17,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
INCOME TAXES: The income tax amounts reflected in the accompanying
financial statements are accounted for under the liability method in
accordance with FAS 109 Accounting for Income Taxes.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: The Company has elected to follow Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
APB 25, and related interpretations in accounting for its stock
options. Since the exercise price of employee stock options granted by the
Company generally equals the market price of the underlying stock on the
date of grant, no compensation expense is recorded. The Company has adopted
the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation FAS 123.
See Note 11.
SEGMENT REPORTING: FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
FAS 131 requires that a public business enterprise report financial and
descriptive information about its reportable operating segments. Generally,
financial information is required to be reported on the basis that it is
used internally for evaluating segment performance and allocating
resources. The Company has assessed its operating and reportable segments
and determined that it operates in one reportable segment as defined in FAS
131.
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: The Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Standards No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities FAS 133
in June 1998 which, as amended, is currently effective January 1, 2001 for
the Company. The Company believes adoption of FAS 133 will not have a
material impact on the Company financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.                    24

3. ACQUISITION
On May 28, 1999, the Company acquired the business and substantially
all the assets of the Tridex Ribbon Business for total cash consideration
of approximately $295,000. The acquisition has been accounted for by the
purchase method of accounting. The purchased assets and liabilities have
been recorded in the Company financial statements at their estimated fair
values at the acquisition date. The results of operations of the acquired
company have been included with those of the Company since the date of
acquisition. The acquisition cost exceeded the fair value of the net assets
acquired by $180,000. Such goodwill is being amortized over a five-year
period on a straight-line basis. Prior to the acquisition, the Company
provided Tridex with space within its Wallingford, CT manufacturing
facility and certain support services for the Tridex Ribbon Business.
4. RECEIVABLES

9. BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT
On January 29, 1998, the Company entered into a $15,000,000 credit
facility with Fleet National Bank Fleet. On May 7, 1999, the Company
replaced this facility with a new two-year $10,000,000 revolving credit
facility with Fleet the Fleet Credit Facility. The Fleet Credit
Facility provided the Company with a $10,000,000 credit facility used to
fund working capital. Borrowings under the Fleet Credit facility bore
interest on outstanding borrowings at Fleet prime rate and bore a
commitment fee ranging from 025% to 0625% on any unused portion of the
Fleet Credit Facility. The Fleet Credit Facility also permitted the Company
to designate a LIBOR rate on outstanding borrowings with a margin ranging

depending on the Company meeting certain ratios. Concurrent with the Fleet
Credit Facility, the Company entered into a swap agreement with Fleet under
which the Company fixed its interest rate at 563% plus the applicable
Margin for two years on $3,000,000 of outstanding borrowings under the
Fleet Credit Facility. The Fleet Credit Facility was secured by a lien on
substantially all the assets of the Company, imposed certain financial
covenants and restricted the payment of cash dividends and the creation of
liens.                    26

all the assets of the Company. The Webster Credit facility also imposes
certain financial covenants on the Company and restricts the payment of
dividends on its common stock and the creation of other liens. The Company

10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
At December 31, 2000, the Company was lessee on operating leases for
equipment and real property. The terms of certain leases provide for
escalating rent payments in later years of the lease as well as payment of
minimum rent and real estate taxes. Rent expense amounted to approximately
$991,000, $953,000 and $957,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Minimum aggregate rental payments required under operating leases that have
initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of

components. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company receives
favorable pricing for volume purchases over the life of the contract. In
the event anticipated purchase levels are not achieved, the Company would
be subject to retroactive price increases on previous purchases. Management
currently anticipates achieving sufficient purchase levels to maintain the
favorable prices.
11. STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

11. STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS CONTINUED
During the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company approved the
cancellation and reissuance of certain outstanding options under the 1996
Stock Plan. Under the program, holders of outstanding options as of

12. STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
In December 1997, the Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights
Plan declaring a distribution of one right the Rights for each
outstanding share of the Company common stock to shareholders of record
at December 15, 1997. Initially, each of the Rights will entitle the
registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a
share of Series A Preferred Stock, $001 par value, at a price of $69 per
one one-thousandth of a share. The Rights, however, will not become
exercisable unless and until, among other things, any person or group of
affiliated persons acquires beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of
the then outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock. If a person, or
group of persons, acquires 15 percent or more of the outstanding Common
Stock of the Company subject to certain conditions and exceptions more
fully described in the Rights Agreement, each Right will entitle the
holder other than the person, or group of persons, who acquired 15 percent
or more of the outstanding Common Stock to purchase Preferred Stock of the
Company having a market value equal to twice the exercise price of the
Right. The Rights are redeemable, under certain circumstances, for $00001
per Right and will expire, unless earlier redeemed, on December 2, 2007.
On February 16, 1999, the Company amended its Stockholder Rights Plan
to remove the provision in the plan that stipulated that the plan may be
modified or redeemed only by those members of the Board of Directors who
are defined as continuing directors.

14. DISCLOSURE REGARDING FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amount for cash and cash equivalents approximates fair
value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying
amount of receivables, other current assets, other assets, accounts payable
and accrued liabilities is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of
the short nature of the transactions. The carrying value of long-term debt
approximates the fair value based upon the variable rate on that debt.
Off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments include
interest-rate swaps. At December 31, 1999, interest-rate swaps, held for
purposes other than trading, had a fair value settlement of $35,000, based
on the underlying principal amount of $3,000,000. The Company sold its
interest-rate swap during 2000.
15. SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS
RESTRUCTURING: During the fourth quarter of 2000 and fourth quarter of
1998, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $189,000 and $300,000,
respectively, for severance costs related to the downsizing and
reorganization of its manufacturing facility in Wallingford, CT. Severance
costs resulted from the reduction of 11 and 14 employees in 2000 and 1999,
respectively. At December 31, 2000, approximately $105,000 of restructuring
expenses remained accrued.
PREFERRED STOCK SALE: On April 7, 2000 the Company sold 4,000 shares of
7% Series B Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock the
Preferred Stock to Advance Capital Advisors, L.P. and its affiliate in
consideration of $1,000 per share the Stated Value, for a total of
$4,000,000, less issuance costs. The Preferred Stock is convertible at any
time by the holders at a conversion price of $900 per common share. In
addition, the Company issued warrants pro-rata to the Preferred Stock
holders to purchase an aggregate of 44,444 shares of the Company common
stock at an exercise price of $900 per common share. The warrants, valued
at $175,000, are exercisable at any time until April 7, 2005, and will be
accreted to preferred stock ratably over 60 months. The Preferred Stock is
subject to mandatory conversion into shares of the Company common stock
when such stock has traded at $35 per share or more for a 30-day period
ending on or after April 7, 2003, or for a 60-day period beginning on or
after April 7, 2002. The Preferred Stock is redeemable at the option of the
holders on April 7, 2005 at $1,000 per share plus any unpaid dividends. On
or after April 7, 2007, the Company has the right to require 1 redemption
of the Preferred Stock at $1,000 per share plus any unpaid dividends or 2
conversion of the Preferred Stock at $900 per common share. Upon a change
of control which the Company does not believe probable, holders have the
right to redeem the Preferred Stock for 200% of the Stated Value plus any
unpaid dividends. The holders of the Preferred Stock have certain voting
rights and are entitled to receive a cumulative annual dividend of $70 per
share, payable quarterly and have preference to any other dividends, if
any, paid by the Company.                    31

15. SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS CONTINUED
PREFERRED STOCK SALE CONTINUED: Concurrent with the issuance of the
Preferred Stock, the Company recorded a beneficial conversion charge. The
beneficial conversion charge was calculated as the difference between the
assigned fair value of the Preferred Stock and the fair value of the
related common stock, as of April 7, 2000, into which the Preferred Stock
was immediately convertible. Accordingly, a deemed preferred dividend of
approximately $56,000 as of the issuance date has been recognized as a
charge to retained earnings and net loss attributable to common
shareholders, and as an increase to additional paid-in capital.
GTECH LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT: On June 25, 1999, the Company commenced a
lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode
Island against GTECH for misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of
contract and related claims, seeking injunctive relief and compensatory and
punitive damages. On July 15, 1999, GTECH and the Company signed a new
five-year agreement under which the Company will be the exclusive
manufacturer and supplier to GTECH of an impact printer for use in GTECH
IsysR online lottery terminal. As part of the agreement, GTECH agreed to
pay the Company $1 million for past design efforts, development costs and
manufacturing interruption costs and agreed to place a non-cancelable order
for delivery of a minimum of approximately $8 million of printers in the
year 2000. In connection with the execution of this agreement, the parties
agreed to have all claims under the lawsuits dismissed and filed dismissal
stipulations to terminate the federal and state lawsuits. As a result of
the settlement, the Company reported $770,000 $1 million cash settlement,
less $230,000 of directly-related expenses in other income during 1999.
LOAN TO OFFICER: On February 23, 1999, with the Board of Directors'
approval, the Company provided a $330,000 loan to an officer of the
Company. The loan proceeds were used to purchase 104,000 shares of the
Company common stock on the open market during January and February 1999.
The loan is payable on February 23, 2004, and is a full recourse obligation
to the officer secured by 154,000 shares of the Company common stock,
which includes 50,000 shares of restricted stock. The loan bears interest
at a rate equivalent to the Company average borrowing rate under its
current credit facility, and is payable annually. The principal amount of
the loan is deducted from shareholders' equity.
STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM: During November 1997, the Board of Directors
approved the repurchase of up to 500,000 shares of the Company common
stock at a price of no more than $12 per share. During May, August and
October 1998, the Board approved the repurchase of an additional 500,000,
250,000 and 250,000 shares, respectively, bringing the total authorized to
15 million shares. The Company acquired 70,800 shares of its common stock
for $229,000 in 1999, 1,003,000 shares for $7,170,000 in 1998, and 200,000
shares for $2,251,000 in 1997. Since the Company began the stock repurchase
program in December 1997 through December 31, 1999, it has repurchased
1,273,800 shares for $9,650,000 an average cost of $758 per share. The
Company did not repurchase any shares during 2000, and management does not
expect to repurchase any additional shares in the foreseeable future.

17. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS unaudited
On February 15, 2001, the Company announced plans to establish a global
engineering and manufacturing center at its Ithaca, NY facility. As part of
this strategic decision, the Company will consolidate all manufacturing and
engineering into its existing Ithaca, NY facility and close its
Wallingford, CT facility by the end of 2001. Production is planned to
continue at the Wallingford facility until the end of 2001, with individual
product lines scheduled to move over the course of 2001. The closing of the
Wallingford facility is expected to result in the termination of employment
of approximately 70 employees. The Company estimates that the non-recurring
costs associated with the consolidation, including severance pay, employee
benefits, moving expenses, non-cancelable lease payments, and other costs,
will be approximately $30 to $35 million and will be recognized during
2001.
On February 27, 2001, the Company amended the Webster Credit Facility
