FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting for the Company. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
and effected by our Board of Directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our
management and board of directors; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving
financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over
financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to
lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial
reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such
limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting
process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not
eliminate, this risk. Management uses the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO, to evaluate the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting. Management assessed our internal control over
financial reporting using the COSO framework as of the end of our fiscal year. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, we believe our internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 was effective. Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial
statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on
managements assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Such attestation, which
expresses unqualified opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, is included in this Item8 under the
heading Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. 72 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Annual
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria. 73 Table of Contents We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December31, 2005 of Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and our report dated March10, 2006
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ Ernst Young LLP

subsidiaries as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December31, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and subsidiaries at
December31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting

Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway

pharmaceutical products principally for the cardiovascular, metabolic and respiratory markets. On July28, 1997, the Company received clearance from the United States Food and Drug
Administration FDA to market Niaspan for the treatment of mixed lipid disorders, a condition
in which a patient is observed to have several abnormalities in the levels of the fatlike
substances, called lipids, that contribute to heart disease. Niaspan is the only once-a-day
prescription and the first extended-release formulation of any type of product with niacin as the
active ingredient ever approved by the FDA for the treatment of mixed lipid disorders. Niaspan is
indicated for the following: ireduce elevated total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol, commonly referred to as LDL or bad cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B, another lipid
particle, and increase low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, commonly referred to as HDL or
good cholesterol; iireduce very high serum triglycerides, which are fatty substances in the
blood that contribute to heart disease; iiireduce elevated total and LDL cholesterol when used
in combination with a bile-binding resin, which is a different class of drugs that reduces bad
cholesterol; ivreduce recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction, or the recurrence of nonfatal
heart attacks; and vpromote the regression or slow the progression of atherosclerosis, which is
a medical condition involving the narrowing of the arteries to the heart, when combined with
bile-binding resins. Additionally, Niaspans prescribing information references its ability to
significantly reduce lipoprotein a, which is referred to as the very bad cholesterol and is an
independent risk factor for coronary heart disease. On January28, 2002, the Company launched Advicor, a solid-dose drug containing Niaspan and
lovastatin, which is a currently marketed cholesterol-lowering drug, for the treatment of mixed
lipid disorders. The Company believes that a once-a-night tablet with the combined complementary
properties of its Niaspan product and lovastatin represents an effective method for treating
patients with mixed lipid disorders. On March8, 2004, the Company announced that it had entered into a product acquisition
agreement with Aventis Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc. the Azmacort Acquisition Agreement and a
finished product supply agreement the Azmacort Supply Agreement and together with the Azmacort
Acquisition Agreement, the Aventis Agreements with Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc. collectively
with Aventis Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc., Aventis to acquire global rights to the Azmacort
triamcinolone acetonide inhalation aerosol franchise. The transaction was completed on March31,
2004. Accordingly, Kos began recording revenue for all sales related to the Azmacort product
beginning April1, 2004. On April12, 2005, the Company entered into a co-promotion agreement the Duramed
Co-promotion Agreement, a licensing and manufacturing agreement the Barr License and
Manufacturing Agreement, and a settlement and license agreement the Barr Settlement and License
Agreement, and collectively, the Barr Agreements with Barr Laboratories, Inc. and certain of
its affiliates Barr, contemporaneous to the resolution of the patent litigation involving the
Companys Niaspan products. Under the Barr License and Manufacturing Agreement, Barr agreed to
stand ready to supply Kos Life Sciences, Inc. KLS, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kos, certain
quantities of Niaspan and Advicor tablets, under or pursuant to Barrs Abbreviated New Drug
Applications ANDAs, as and when approved, and granted KLS a license to use, market and sell, at
a future date, Barrs versions of the Companys Niaspan and Advicor products as and when approved
in the United States. Barr received an initial license fee and receives quarterly payments to
remain compliant with FDA current Good 80 Table of Contents Manufacturing Practices cGMP and to stand ready to meet the Companys manufacturing
requirements on short notice. The Barr Settlement and License Agreement sets forth the terms of the settlement of the
litigation between Kos and Barr. It permits Barr to launch a generic version of Niaspan and
Advicor, as well as future dosage formulations, strengths or modified versions of the products,
under terms of an exclusive license commencing on September20, 2013, approximately four years
earlier than the last-to-expire KLS patent. Pursuant to the Duramed Co-promotion Agreement,
Duramed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Duramed, an affiliate of Barr, promotes the Companys Niaspan and
Advicor products to physicians who mostly specialize in womens healthcare. In consideration of
Durameds performance of its co-promotion obligations, the Company pays Duramed royalties subject
to certain sales caps. On May2, 2005, KLS entered into a strategic commercialization and research and development
alliance with Biovail Corporation and certain of its affiliates Biovail in the area of
cardiovascular disease the Biovail Agreements. Pursuant to the Biovail Agreements, KLS acquired
the rights to the Teveten eprosartan mesylate and Teveten HCT eprosartan
mesylate/hydrochlorothiazide products collectively, the Teveten Products, and obtained
exclusive sales and marketing rights to the Cardizem LA diltiazem hydrochloride product in the
United States. The Company began recording revenue for sales related to the Teveten Products and
Cardizem LA in May2005. On July7, 2005, the Company received notice from Biovail that Andrx Corporation had filed
with the FDA an ANDA that would, if approved, allow Andrx Corporation to market a generic version
of the Cardizem LA product. On August10, 2005, a lawsuit alleging patent infringement against
Andrx Pharmaceuticals, L.L.C. and Andrx Corporation collectively Andrx in Biovails name was
commenced in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware Delaware District
Court. Upon receiving a second ParagraphIV certification from Andrx Pharmaceuticals, L.L.C.
directed to additional Cardizem LA tablet strengths of 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 mg added by
amendment to Andrxs ANDA, on October14, 2005, a second complaint alleging additional patent
infringement was filed in Biovails name in the Delaware District Court. These two civil actions
have been consolidated by the Court for all purposes. Under the current case schedule, fact and
expert discovery is scheduled to close on September5, 2006, and the trial is scheduled for April
9, 2007. These dates, however, may change. On November6, 2005, KLS entered into an exclusive Collaboration and License Agreement the
Jerini Agreement with Jerini US, Inc. Jerini, a subsidiary of Jerini AG, for the
development, marketing and distribution of Jerinis compound, Icatibant, a peptidomimetic
bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, in the United States and Canada. In connection with the Jerini
Agreement, KLS paid a $142million upfront licensing payment the Jerini Licensing Payment to
Jerini. Additionally, Kos consummated an investment in Jerini AG the Jerini Investment. No assurance can be given that the Companys products can be successfully marketed, that
products under development can be successfully formulated or manufactured at acceptable cost and
with appropriate quality, or that required regulatory approvals will be obtained. The Company is
subject to a number of other risks including, but not limited to, the continued market acceptance
of the Companys products, the expected continued growth in sales of the Companys products, the
success of the Companys relationship with its co-promotion, commercialization and strategic
alliance partners, the Companys ability to successfully develop both internally and through
sponsored research arrangements with third parties and commercialize new products under
development and within expected timeframes, fluctuating buying patterns by the Companys
wholesalers and distributors, the accuracy of the inventory data supplied by wholesalers and
distributors pursuant to IMAs, the adequacy of the Companys reserves for income taxes, the
Companys ability to maintain coverage of its products by government agencies and the effects of
the loss of such coverage with such agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare and 81 Table of Contents Medicaid Services, the protection afforded by the Companys patents and those related to the
acquired and licensed products, the effect of conditions in the pharmaceutical industry and the
economy in general, changes in the business and regulation of health care reimbursement, the
Companys ability to maintain compliance with FDA standards without adversely affecting its
manufacturing capability or ability to meet its production requirements, the Companys ability to
ensure compliance with prescription drug sales and marketing laws and regulations, changes in the
regulatory environment governing the Companys compliance with FDA, Patent Trademark Office, tax
and competition issues, changes in the law or governmental policy concerning the antitrust
treatment of patent license and patent infringement settlement
agreements, and the impact of a possible
generic version of the Cardizem LA product or other products sold by the Company. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the results of the Company and its subsidiaries,
Kos Life Sciences, Inc, Aeropharm Technology, LLC and IEP Pharmaceutical Devices, LLC. All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Reclassification Balances related to the Companys advance payment received on license agreements and deferred
tax assets have been reclassified on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements and Related
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as of December31, 2004, in order to conform to the
current year presentation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions made by management in the preparation of
the accompanying financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts; reserves for
inventory obsolescence, product returns, chargebacks, managed care rebates, expected government
price reporting related obligations, discounts and other sales allowances; estimation of customer
inventory levels; estimation of the useful lives and realizability of recorded intangible assets;
and the accounting for income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 90
days or less to be cash equivalents. Trade Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company recognizes trade accounts receivable at the time product arrives at the customers
location. The Company specifically analyzes its trade receivables and provides reserves for items
determined not to be collectable. In addition, the Company provides general reserves for a portion
of receivables where items, generally based on age, are deemed to represent a significant risk of
loss. Historically, the Company has not had significant write-offs of its trade accounts
receivable. 82 Table of Contents Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in,
first-out method. Components of inventory cost include raw materials, labor, and manufacturing
overhead. The Company considers factors such as the amount of inventory on hand, estimated time
required to sell such inventories, remaining shelf life, and current market conditions to determine
whether inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Certain raw materials used by the Company in the manufacture of its Niaspan and Advicor
products are available from a limited number of suppliers. The Company obtains the Azmacort product
pursuant to a supply agreement with Inyx, Inc. Inyx that will remain in effect until at least
March31, 2015 see Note 6 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information
regarding Inyx. As such, the Company relies on Inyx to manufacture and supply adequate quantities
of the finished Azmacort product. Although there is one other company that is currently qualified
to manufacture and supply the Azmacort product, the Company does not have any contractual
arrangement with such other entity. As a result, the Company relies solely on Inyx to supply the
Company with the Azmacort product. The Company obtains Cardizem LA through a supply agreement the
Biovail Supply Agreement with Biovail that will remain in effect until at least December31,
2008, and procures its Teveten Products from Solvay Pharmaceutical Marketing and Licensing AG
Solvay through an agreement in effect until the patents of the Teveten Products expire. As a
result, the Company relies solely on Biovail and Solvay to supply the Company with Cardizem LA and
Teveten/Teveten HCT products. The Company is also dependent on its other suppliers to allocate a
sufficient portion of their capacity to meet the Companys needs. Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability
of assets to be held and used is measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to
the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them. At the time such evaluations
indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long-lived assets are not sufficient to
recover the carrying value of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their fair values. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets held for sale by comparing the
assets carrying amount with its fair value less cost to sell. No assets were held for sale as of
December31, 2005 or 2004. During the quarter ended December31, 2005, the Company revised its
estimate for the useful life of developed technology related to Azmacort, and as such, recorded
additional amortization expense of $14million for the year ended December31, 2005 see Note 6 to
these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding this change in
estimate. Fair Value of Financial Instruments As of December31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, trade
accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the short term nature of
these accounts. The fair value of the note payable to shareholder outstanding as of December31,
2004, was determined using interest rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and, because
interest expense is payable utilizing variable rates that re-price frequently, the carrying value
approximates fair value. 83 Table of Contents Concentration of Credit Risk The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with a major financial institution. The
Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of this institution to limit
its credit risk exposure. The Company conducts a significant amount of its sales with a limited number of large
pharmaceutical wholesalers and warehousing chains. Accordingly, 91% of the trade accounts
receivable before allowances at December31, 2005, were represented by five of these customers. The
Company performs periodic evaluations of the financial condition of all customers to limit its
credit risk exposure, but does not obtain collateral. The Company has no significant
off-balance-sheet concentrations of credit risk. Revenue Recognition Sales and the related cost of sales are recognized at the time product arrives at the
customers location. The Companys largest customers are distributors who warehouse product and, in
turn, sell that product to retailers and others. Total revenue by product for the years ended
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were as follows

Net sales consist of gross sales to the Companys customers less provisions for expected
returns from customers, customer discounts, IMA fees, and rebates and chargebacks to managed care
organizations and government units with whom the Company has contracts. These provisions totaled
$2726million, $1803million, and $830million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. The most significant of these amounts is the Companys provision for rebates
and chargebacks to managed care organizations and governmental units. For the year ended December
31, 2005, Kos provision for managed care and government rebates and chargebacks decreased as a
percentage of gross sales by less than 1% over the preceding period, mainly as a result of the
introduction of Cardizem LA and the Teveten Products during the second quarter of 2005. For the
year ended December31, 2004, Kos provision for managed care and government rebates and
chargebacks increased as a percentage of gross sales by 22% over the 2003 period, mostly as a
result of increased availability of the Companys Niaspan and Advicor products to patients having
access to medical care through managed care organizations and government units, including the
second quarter 2004 Kos introduction of the Azmacort product. Included in Accrued expenses in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets are $793million and $500million at December31, 2005
and 2004, respectively, related to these provisions. The most pertinent inputs used in the estimation of the Companys sales allowances and
accruals, and product inventory levels in its distribution channel as discussed below, include
prescription data derived from a third party publication, consumer price index derived from a
third party publication, product best price Best Price as calculated by the Company based on
its available data, and average 84 Table of Contents manufacturer price AMP as calculated by the Company based on its available data. Of
these inputs, prescription data requires significant estimation. Accounting for Product Returns and Inventory Management Agreements Impact on Revenue Recognition The Companys return policy allows a customer to return product no sooner than six months
prior to the products expiration date and no later than one year after the products expiration
date. The Company periodically evaluates the volume of its products that are in customer
inventories or elsewhere in the distribution channel to determine whether increased risk of product
returns exists. For the period from the introduction of its Niaspan and Advicor products through
December31, 2002, Kos return risk expectations were consistently based on its limited product
return experience given the early stage nature of its products and of the Company. Accordingly, Kos
established a specific return risk estimate based on estimated inventory levels in the distribution
channel that was used to determine the amount of revenue that could be recorded during a given
period. During the quarter ended March31, 2003, as a result of the significant history of minimal
returns for the Niaspan and Advicor products since their introduction, Kos revised its return risk
estimates to reflect the historically low product return patterns. This change in accounting estimate resulted in the Company recognizing as revenue all product
shipments made during the year ended December31, 2003, as well as $111million of its prior
period product shipments not previously recognized as revenue because of its previous product
return risk exposure estimates. The impact of this change in estimate increased the Companys
reported revenues, net income, and basic and diluted earnings per share by $111million, $99
million, and $045 per share and $024 per share, respectively, for the year ended December31,
2003. The Company will continue to monitor wholesaler inventory levels, and, if the Companys
product return risk exceeds acceptable levels, the Company may be required to not recognize the
revenue and related costs associated with the excess inventory until such return risk is mitigated. During the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006 see Note 18 to these Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the third IMA of the Company, the
Company signed IMAs with its three largest customers. These agreements have enhanced the Companys
ability to monitor inventory levels for marketed products and, as a result, the Company has amended
estimates for inventory levels in the distribution channel as of December31, 2005 the Change in
Inventory Level Estimate. Prior to signing its IMAs, the Company estimated inventory levels using
net sales and estimated withdrawals using prescription data from the marketplace. The impact of
this change in estimate resulted in an increase in net sales, net income and basic and diluted
earnings per share for the year ended December31, 2005 of $170million, $79million, and $018
per share and $017 per share, respectively. The Company believes that the IMAs provide for a more
precise and accurate estimate of product inventory in its distribution channel by allowing direct
access to product inventory held by its top three customers, which accounted for approximately 81%
of total revenue in 2005. Shipping and Handling Costs The Company typically does not charge customers for shipping and handling costs. Shipping and
handling costs are classified as Cost of sales in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Income. International Commercialization Agreements with Merck KGaA and Oryx On October23, 2002, the Company signed an exclusive international commercialization agreement
with Merck KGaA to market the Companys Niaspan and Advicor products outside the United States,
Canada and Japan the Merck Agreement. Under the terms of the Merck Agreement, Merck KGaA will
provide Kos up to $610million in licensing, upfront, milestone and reimbursement payments. Kos,
which manufactures the product supplied to Merck KGaA, receives licensing revenue amounting to 25%
of net sales of the products in the territory, which includes the cost of goods sold, and upfront
and 85 Table of Contents milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory approvals and sales thresholds.
Through December31, 2005, Kos has received $200million in upfront, reimbursement, and milestone
payments from Merck KGaA, including $150million of upfront and reimbursement payments of which
$38million is currently refundable to Merck KGaA if Kos fails to achieve certain regulatory
milestones. Merck KGaA is responsible for conducting Phase IV clinical studies and
commercialization activities. Kos is responsible for obtaining initial marketing authorization in
all major European countries, for the supply and manufacturing of the products, and for certain
critical marketing related functions. Kos manufacturing commitment to Merck KGaA is a pervasive
element of the Merck Agreement as Merck KGaA is dependent on Kos continuing involvement and
commitment to manufacture and supply the Niaspan and Advicor products. Furthermore, Kos is
responsible for ensuring the quality and maintaining a worldwide database of adverse events of the
products that it manufactures for Merck KGaA. The critical marketing related services provided by
Kos include: active participation in the planning of commercialization efforts by Merck KGaA, the
sharing, review and dissemination of information pertaining to the safety and tolerability of the
Niaspan and Advicor products, and the development, registration, and maintenance of trademarks for
Niaspan and Advicor on a worldwide basis, as requested by Merck KGaA. The Companys policy with respect to recording licensing revenue resulting from Merck KGaA
product sales is to record such licensing revenue as the related product sales are generated by
Merck KGaA. Through March31, 2005, the Companys policy related to licensing revenue resulting
from milestone and upfront payments was to recognize such licensing revenue over the then remaining
agreement period using the straight-line method and to recognize reimbursement payments as an
offset to operating expenses over the then remaining agreement period using the straight-line
method. During the year ended December31, 2005, the Company re-evaluated its policy for
recognizing such licensing revenue and reimbursement payments and determined that a
proportional-performance revenue recognition method more appropriately reflected Kos continuing
obligations relative to the arrangement with Merck KGaA, while also incorporating the recognition
of revenue relative to the efforts extended up to the point of receiving the upfront and
reimbursement payments and attaining marketing authorization the Merck Accounting Change. The Merck Accounting Change represents the correction of an accounting error by the Company.
The Merck Accounting Change increased the Companys revenue and pre-tax income by $18million, or
$004 per fully diluted share for the year ended December31, 2005, and increased the Companys net
income by $11million, or $002 per fully diluted share for the year ended December31, 2005. Including the effect of the Merck Accounting Change, the Company recorded licensing revenue
associated with the amortization of upfront and milestone payments received pursuant to the Merck
Agreement of $33million and $11million during the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Pursuant to the Merck Agreement, the Company also recorded offsets to research and
development expenses of $02million for each of the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004. The Company expects to continue to recognize as revenue or as an offset to research and
development expenses, over the remaining term of the Merck Agreement, the upfront, reimbursement
and milestone payments received from Merck KGaA. Included in Advance payment received on license
agreement, net of amortized amount in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December
31, 2005, are $148million related to upfront, reimbursement and milestone payments received from
Merck KGaA that are expected to be recognized as licensing revenue or as an offset to research and
development expenses in future periods. On August20, 2003, Kos announced an exclusive development and commercialization agreement
with Oryx, for the commercialization of Niaspan and Advicor in Canada. Under the agreement, Oryx is
responsible for obtaining marketing authorization for Niaspan and Advicor in Canada and for all 86 Table of Contents promotional investments, and Kos is responsible for manufacturing and supplying Advicor and
Niaspan following receipt of marketing authorization for such products in Canada. Niaspan and
Advicor received marketing approval in Canada in March and August2005, respectively. Kos will
share the revenues from sales of Niaspan and Advicor in Canada with Oryx. The Company recorded $07
million of licensing revenue during the year ended December31, 2005, pursuant to the agreement
with Oryx. Co-Promotion and Strategic Alliance Arrangements On October17, 2003, the Company entered into a three-year agreement with Takeda to co-promote
Niaspan and Advicor in the United States. Pursuant to this agreement, Takeda utilizes its United
States-based sales force to promote Niaspan and Advicor in addition to its own products. Takeda is
responsible for providing a significant promotional effort and for all costs associated with its
sales force, including promotional materials and samples. The Company is responsible for
manufacturing and supplying both products and collects and records all sales associated with its
products. Takeda receives a royalty on incremental net sales of the products in the United States
above a certain baseline amount. This co-promotion arrangement has a three-year term commencing
January2004 and provides for residual payments to Takeda after the three years, if the parties do
not renew the agreement. On April12, 2005, the Company entered into the Duramed Co-promotion Agreement under which
Duramed promotes the Companys Niaspan and Advicor products to physicians who specialize mostly in
womens healthcare. In consideration of Durameds performance of its co-promotion obligations, the
Company pays Duramed royalties subject to certain sales caps. Subject to other terms, conditions
and provisions of such agreement regarding early termination, the Duramed Co-promotion Agreement is
effective for an initial term of seven years. Fixed Assets Fixed assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation
and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets or lease terms as follows

leases Investment Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, requires that, among other things, marketable equity
and debt securities classified as available-for-sale be carried at fair value, with unrealized
gains and losses reported directly in other comprehensive income. The
cost related to investments available-for-sale is determined
utilizing the specific identification method. The Jerini Investment is
classified as an available-for-sale security and was recorded at its fair value of $128million
under Investment in the accompanying balance sheet as of December31, 2005. The $06million net of
tax unrealized gain related to the Jerini Investment was recorded as other comprehensive income as
of December31, 2005. Research and Development Expenses All research and development expenses are reflected in the Companys consolidated statements
of income as incurred. 87 Table of Contents Advertising Expense The Company records the cost of its advertising efforts when services are performed or goods
are delivered. The Company recorded $97million, $75million, and $68million in advertising
expense for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Leases The Company leases manufacturing, research, and administrative properties under operating
leases. Certain of these leases contain renewal options, scheduled rent escalation clauses, rent
concessions, and/or leasehold improvement incentives. The Company accounts for leases under the
provisions of SFAS No13, Accounting for Leases, as amended. Leases expire at various dates
through 2014, with renewal options through 2023. Income Taxes The provisions of SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109, require, among
other things, recognition of future tax benefits measured at enacted rates attributable to the
deductible temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and
liabilities and to tax net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that the realization of such
benefits is more likely than not see Note 9. Under SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of
assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
expected to reverse. 88 Table of Contents Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is determined by dividing the Companys net income by the weighted
average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Diluted income per share also includes
dilutive Common Stock equivalents outstanding after applying the treasury stock method to
outstanding stock options and warrants and the if converted method to convertible debt. A

The calculation of weighted average shares outstanding for the years ended December31, 2005,
2004 and 2003 excludes 09million, 30million and 02million shares, respectively, of
outstanding stock options because their impact is antidilutive. Reporting of Comprehensive Income SFAS No130 Reporting Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for reporting and display
of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of financial statements. Comprehensive
income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are not included in net income or loss
but rather are recorded directly in stockholders equity, such as certain unrealized gain or loss
items. Comprehensive income for the year ended December31, 2005 was $1187million, and included
$06million of unrealized gains, net of tax, on the Jerini Investment. Reported net income equaled
comprehensive income for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation As permitted by SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 148, which
amended SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company accounts for options
issued to employees and to outside directors after June30, 2000 under Accounting Principles
Board APB Opinion No25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 using the

Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS 123R,
Share-Based PaymentSFAS 123R. SFAS 123R requires measurement of all employee stock-based
compensation awards using a fair value method and the recording of such expense in the consolidated
financial statements. In addition, the adoption of SFAS 123R will require additional accounting
related to the income tax effects and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow effects
resulting from share-based payment arrangements. SFAS 123R is effective for the Company beginning
in the first quarter of 2006. The Company has evaluated the requirements of SFAS 123R and it
estimates that the adoption of SFAS 123R will result in pre-tax compensation cost of approximately
$45million, or $28million of after-tax compensation cost, for the year ended December31, 2006.
This approximation of SFAS123R compensation cost is dependant upon various variable inputs such as
the market value of the Companys shares of Common Stock, the volatility of the Companys shares of
Common Stock, the expected life of stock option grants, the number of options granted, and
forfeiture rates for options under the Companys 90 Table of Contents stock option plan. Accordingly, actual SFAS123R gross compensation cost and after-tax
compensation cost for the year ended December31, 2006, may be materially different from the
Companys estimate. In December2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No109-1, Application of FASB Statement No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided
by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 SFAS 109-1. SFAS 109-1 clarifies that tax deductions
arising from qualified production activities should be accounted for as a special deduction in
accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109 with no effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities existing at the date of enactment. Rather, the impact of these tax
deductions should be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the Companys tax
return. The provision for income taxes for the year ended December31, 2005, included a tax benefit
related to the Companys qualified production activities of $14million. 3. Trade Accounts Receivable, net Trade accounts receivable, net, consist of the following

The Company recorded depreciation expense of $61million, $43million, and $33million for
the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 6. Product Acquisition and Intangible Assets On March8, 2004, the Company announced that it had entered into the Aventis Agreements to
acquire global rights to the Azmacort triamcinolone acetonide inhalation aerosol franchise. The
transaction was completed on March31, 2004. Accordingly, Kos began recording revenue for all
sales related to the Azmacort product beginning April1, 2004. Under the terms of the Aventis Agreements, Kos paid Aventis approximately $2061million in
cash and agreed to pay a royalty on future sales of another version of the product to be developed,
a chlorofluorocarbon CFC-free product that was being developed by Aventis. Under the terms of
the Azmacort Supply Agreement, Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc., agreed to a five-year supply agreement
beginning on March31, 2004. On March31, 2005, Inyx acquired the assets and business of the
Aventis affiliate responsible for the manufacture of Azmacort and agreed, among other things, to a
new ten-year term to produce and supply Azmacort. 92 Table of Contents The purchase price relative to the Azmacort Acquisition Agreement has been allocated based on

The $380million value assigned to in-process research and development of the CFC-free
product was recorded as a research and development expense in the accompanying condensed
consolidated statement of operations during the quarter ended March31, 2004 the Azmacort
In-process RD Write-off. The Azmacort In-process RD Write-off resulted in the Company also
recording an approximately $144million deferred tax benefit to account for the difference between
the book and tax basis of accounting for this write-off. The amount assigned to in-process technology was determined by identifying the specific
in-process research and development projects that would be continued and for which a
technological feasibility had not been established as of the acquisition date, bthere was no
alternative future use, and cthe fair value was estimable with reasonable reliability. The acquired in-process research and development represents a single project, the
hydrofluoroalkane HFA formulation of Azmacort. The HFA formulation of Azmacort does not use a
CFC-based propellant and, consequently, to the knowledge of the Company, should not contribute to
the depletion of the Earths ozone layer. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the
Ozone Layer the Protocol is an international treaty under which the production and consumption
of ozone-depleting substances is being phased out worldwide. Under the Protocol, codified by the
United States Congress into law in Title VI of the Clean Air Act, the production of CFCs in the
United States was banned as of January1, 1996, unless a specific exemption is approved annually by
the international parties to the Protocol. In order to comply with the Clean Air Act and the
Montreal Protocol, the United States will eventually need to phase out CFC-propelled Metered Dose
Inhalers. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company revised its estimate for the useful life
of its Azmacort developed technology as a result of changes in the industry relating to the
regulation by the FDA of CFCs. This change in estimate resulted in the Company recording additional
amortization of $14million during the quarter ended December31, 2005. Moreover, the weighed
average useful life of Azmacort developed and core technology was changed from 10 to 7years. Although the product had previously received an approvable letter from the FDA, the Azmacort
HFA formulation had not achieved technological feasibility as of the date of the Aventis
Agreements. Among the technological matters to be resolved are manufacturing controls and evidence
of dose proportionality between the 75 g and 225 g dosage formulations. If the technological and
regulatory challenges are overcome, sales of the Azmacort HFA formulation could begin in late 2008
to early 2009. 93 Table of Contents On May2, 2005, the Company entered into the Biovail Agreements. Pursuant to such agreements,
the Company acquired rights to the Teveten Products, and obtained exclusive sales and marketing
rights to the Cardizem LA product in the United States. In addition, the Company will obtain
commercial rights to the Cardizem Combination Product, and the right of first negotiation to two
other research and development projects in the cardio/metabolic disease area. In conjunction with
the Biovail Agreements, the Company hired 184 Biovail employees, approximately 150 of whom were
sales territory managers. Under the terms of the Biovail Agreements, Kos paid Biovail approximately $1060million in
cash, pays royalties on sales of the Teveten Products and will pay a royalty on the Cardizem
Combination Product when and if approved and commercialized. Kos currently obtains the Cardizem LA
product from Biovail and will also obtain the Cardizem Combination Product from Biovail. The
Company obtains the Teveten Products from Solvay. The allocation of the purchase price relative to the Biovail Agreements and the weighted
average lives of its components is as follows

The $28million value assigned to in-process research and development of the Cardizem
Combination Product was recorded as a research and development expense in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income the Cardizem Combination Product In-process RD Write-off.
The Cardizem Combination Product In-process RD Write-off resulted in the Company also recording an
approximately $10million deferred tax benefit to account for the difference between the book and
tax basis of accounting for this write-off. The amount assigned to in-process technology was determined by identifying the specific
in-process research and development projects that would be continued and for which a
technological feasibility had not been established as of the acquisition date, bthere was no
alternative future use, and cthe fair value was estimable with reasonable reliability. The acquired Cardizem Combination Product In-process RD Write-off represents a single project
involving a single tablet formulation of Cardizem LA and enalapril. Enalapril is used alone or in
combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. It is also used in combination
with other medications to treat heart failure. Enalapril is in a class of medications called
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. It works by decreasing certain chemicals that tighten
the blood vessels, so blood flows more smoothly and the heart can pump blood more efficiently. 94 Table of Contents The Cardizem Combination Product had not achieved technological feasibility as of the date of
the Biovail Agreements. The primary technological matter to be resolved is formulation
methodology. If the technological and regulatory challenges are overcome, sales of the Cardizem
Combination Product could begin as early as 2008. Further development of the Cardizem Combination
Product is to be primarily conducted by Biovail. The fair value of all of the in-process research and development acquired through the Aventis
Agreements and Biovail Agreements was determined using the income approach. This method starts
with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with the in-process
technology. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate
discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams, some of which
are more certain than others. The risk-adjusted discount rates utilized in calculating the fair
value of the Azmacort HFA formulation and the Cardizem Combination Product were 36% and 53 respectively. Intangible assets consist of the following

Indefinite-lived intangible assets The Company calculates amortization of intangible assets based on their estimated useful
lives ranging from 5 to 22years. The Company recorded $231million and $110million of
amortization expense related to its intangible assets during the years ended December31, 2005 and
2004, respectively. Amortization expense of intangible assets is estimated to be $310million for
each of the fiscal years from 2006 through 2008, $303million for 2009, and $301million for
2010. Except for amortization related to the Azmacort developed and core technology intangible
asset, the Company records amortization expense related to its intangible assets as cost of sales.
The Company does not allocate to cost of sales the amortization charges related to the Azmacort
developed and core technology intangible asset because such amortization is not clearly related to
the production of the Azmacort product as it also pertains to components related to Kos ability to
conduct further research and development, for which the Company is primarily responsible, and
market and sell the Azmacort product. The Company recorded
$152million and $103million of amortization charges
related to the Azmacort developed and core technology
intangible asset for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Such amortization charges
for the Azmacort developed and core technology are included under Selling, general and
administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 95 Table of Contents 7. Accrued Expenses The components of accrued expenses are as follows

8. Notes Payable to Shareholder On December19, 2002, the Company entered into an agreement with Michael Jaharis, Chairman
Emeritus of the Companys Board of Directors and its principal shareholder, whereby Mr.Jaharis
agreed to replace the previous $30-million credit facility extended to the Company on July1, 1998
which was to expire on December31, 2002, with another facility expiring on June30, 2008 the
Additional Standby Facility. In connection with this new credit arrangement, the Company
granted to Mr.Jaharis non-detachable warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of the Companys Common
Stock at an exercise price based on the market price of the Companys Common Stock on the date that
the first draw under this facility occurs. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under the
Additional Standby Facility as of December31, 2005. Borrowings, when outstanding, will bear
interest at the prime rate 725% as of December31, 2005, and will be subject to standard and
customary loan covenants, as well as a condition that the death of the lender shall not have
occurred, that lender, his spouse, children and entities they control continue to own at least 40%
of the Common Stock of the Company, and that no material adverse change shall have occurred to the
Company or its financial operations. On January10, 2005, Mr.Jaharis transferred all of his
existing rights and obligations under the Additional Standby Facility to his wife, Mary Jaharis. On December21, 1999, Mr.Jaharis extended a $50-million loan to the Company the Standby
Facility which matured on June30, 2005. In lieu of a conversion feature, the Company
granted to Mr.Jaharis non-detachable warrants to purchase 6,000,000 shares of the Companys Common
Stock at $500 per share, which approximated the market value of the Companys Common Stock on the
effective date of the Standby Facility. Mr.Jaharis exercised 2,000,000 and 200,000
warrants to purchase shares of the Companys Common Stock at $500 per share on October13, 2004,
and November24, 2004, respectively. On January10, 2005, Mr.Jaharis transferred all of his
existing rights and obligations under the Standby Facility to his wife, Mary Jaharis. In June2005,
Mrs.Jaharis exercised the remaining 3,800,000 warrants to purchase shares of the Companys Common
Stock under the Standby Facility, thereby relieving the Company of $19million of debt outstanding.
As of June30, 2005, the Standby Facility was terminated. Interest expense under the Companys credit facilities totaled $05million, $12million and
$33million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 96 Table of Contents 9. Income Taxes The Company follows SFAS 109, which requires, among other things, recognition of future tax
benefits and liabilities measured at enacted tax rates attributable to temporary differences
between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and to tax net operating
loss carryforwards to the extent that realization of said benefits is more likely than not. Through December31, 2003, the Company had established a valuation allowance against its net
deferred tax assets because there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that the Company would
more likely than not realize all or a portion of such assets. During the first quarter of 2004,
management determined, based on the Companys historical profitability and on its expected future
profitability, that the Company would generate sufficient taxable income to realize its deferred
tax assets prior to the expiration of most net operating loss carryforwards NOLs and,
therefore, that the Company will more likely than not realize most of its deferred tax assets.
Under SFAS 109, the valuation allowance should be adjusted when a change in circumstances causes a
change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets. The portion of the valuation
allowance related to NOLs expected to be utilized to offset estimated ordinary income in the
current year is included in the computation of the estimated annual effective tax rate. The portion
of the valuation allowance related to other deferred tax assets, including NOLs expected to be
utilized to offset ordinary income in future years, is reversed as of the date of the change in
circumstances. Accordingly, during the year ended December31, 2004, the Company reversed $712
million of its valuation allowance previously established against its net deferred tax assets. At
December31, 2004, the Company had a remaining valuation allowance of approximately $42million
related to certain NOLs and credits. During 2005, the $42million valuation allowance was
reversed with $04million of the reversal resulting in a benefit from income taxes. The remaining
$38million did not affect the Companys provision for income taxes since the related deferred tax
asset was also reversed. As of December31, 2005 and December31, 2004, the Company had deferred tax assets of
approximately $663million and $587million, respectively. The composition of the net deferred
tax assets is as follows

As of December31, 2005, the Company had approximately $852million of state net operating
losses available to offset future taxable income. These NOLs will expire between 2006 and 2022.
Net deferred tax assets, as of December31, 2005, totaled approximately $663million. If Kos is
unable to generate sufficient future taxable income through operating results, or if its estimates
about future profitability change significantly, a portion or all of its deferred tax assets may
have to be reserved through adjustments to the provision for income taxes. 98 Table of Contents 10. Major Customers Sales to customers that were at least 10% of the Companys net sales are as follows

ANDA that would, if approved, allow Andrx to market a generic version of the Cardizem LA product.
Andrxs notice letter to Biovail alleged that its proposed product would not infringe United States
Patent Nos. 5,288,505 and 5,529,791, which are listed in the FDA Orange Book as covering Cardizem
LA, and that 505 patent was invalid. Under the terms of the Biovail Agreements, if a generic drug
company files an ANDA, Biovail has the first right to initiate a lawsuit, and Kos, in its
discretion, may initiate suit if Biovail elects not to file suit. On August10, 2005, a lawsuit against Andrx in Biovails name was commenced in the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware Civil Action No05-586. The complaint
averred that Andrxs filing of its ANDA constituted infringement of the 791 patent. Andrxs
Answer denied infringement of the 791 patent and asserted affirmative defenses of invalidity. In
addition, Andrx counterclaimed for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity. Andrx
sought no monetary relief, other than recovery of attorney fees and costs. Upon receiving a second ParagraphIV certification from Andrx directed to additional Cardizem
LA tablet strengths of 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 mg added by an amendment to Andrxs ANDA, on
October14, 2005, a second complaint was filed in Biovails name in the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware Civil Action No05-730. The complaint averred that Andrxs
Amended ANDA constituted infringement of the 791 patent. Andrxs Answer denied infringement of
the 791 patent and asserted affirmative defenses of invalidity. In addition, Andrx counterclaimed
for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity. Andrx sought no monetary relief,
other than recovery of attorney fees and costs. Civil actions 05-586 and 05-730 have been consolidated by the Court for all purposes. Under
the current case schedule, fact and expert discovery is scheduled to close on September5, 2006,
and trial is scheduled for April9, 2007. These dates, however, may change. If the patents relating to Cardizem LA are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed, the
Company and Biovail would be unable to prevent Andrx from producing and marketing a generic version
of the Cardizem LA product, which could be sold at prices lower than those charged by the Company.
This would have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, operating results and
financial results. The Company and Biovail would also be unable to prevent other companies from
introducing similar generic products into the marketplace. In February2005, Kos learned that the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services the OIG in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Justice, is
conducting an investigation of Kos marketing and sales practices. It appears that the
investigation arises out of allegations that Kos engaged in potentially improper sales and
marketing practices. The Company believes that the federal investigation was initiated as a result
of a complaint filed under seal by a third party, known as qui tam or whistleblower complaint,
under the federal False Claims Act, which permits private individuals to bring confidential actions
on behalf of the government. Because any qui tam complaint, if filed, is under seal, the Company
has not been able to review it. In March2005, the United States Department of Justice, through the Office of the United
States Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, served an investigative subpoena on Kos the
Wisconsin Subpoena. The Wisconsin Subpoena requests production of a variety of documents
relating to Kos marketing and sales practices. Kos has produced a number of documents in response
to the Wisconsin Subpoena and continues to provide the government with additional responsive
documents. In March 107 Table of Contents 2006, the United States Department of Justice, through the Office of the United States
Attorney for the Western District of Louisiana, served an investigative subpoena on Kos the
Louisiana Subpoena. Similar to the Wisconsin Subpoena, the Louisiana Subpoena requests a
variety of documents relating to Kos marketing and sales practices. In addition, the Louisiana
Subpoena requests information relating to Kos calculation and reporting of average manufacturer
prices AMP and best price under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program as set forth at 42 U.S.C. 
1396r-8 Best Price. Kos has engaged outside counsel to assist it in conducting its own
internal investigation of the issues raised in the Wisconsin Subpoena and Louisiana Subpoena and in
its production of documents. The inquiries described above arise in an environment of rising costs for prescription drugs
and heightened public scrutiny of the pharmaceutical industry and its practices. This public
scrutiny is characterized by extensive press coverage, ongoing attention in Congress and in state
legislatures, and investigations and public statements by law enforcement officials. These factors
contribute to the uncertainty regarding the possible course and outcome of the matters discussed
above. While Kos believes that it is currently in substantial compliance with health care and
other laws applicable to Kos, the information requested by the investigating authorities is not
limited to Kos current business operations or practices but extends back to 1997 in the case of
the Louisiana Subpoena and 2000 in the case of the Wisconsin Subpoena. Kos has compliance measures
in place that are designed to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements, but there can be no
assurance that such compliance measures are, or have been, sufficient or that employees will not
deviate, or have not deviated in the past, from the Companys policies and legal requirements in
such a way that it would have a material adverse effect on Kos ability to defend any proceedings
brought by the OIG, the U.S. Department of Justice, or any qui tam relator or others. Currently,
management cannot predict the timing or outcome of these pending investigations and inquiries and
whether they will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. An adverse outcome in any one of the
matters described above could result in substantial civil and/or criminal fines, other monetary
damages, material changes to Kos business practices, and exclusion from federal healthcare
programs. As a result, such matters could have a material adverse effect on the Companys
business, financial condition and results of operations. On April22, 2005, the Company provided to the Federal Trade Commission and Department of
Justice Anti-trust Division the notifications of the settlement with Barr as required under Section
1112a of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. The
settlement with Barr and the other arrangements with Barr and its affiliates may be reviewed by
anti-trust enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice
Anti-trust Division. There can be no assurances that governmental authorities will not seek to
challenge the settlement with Barr or that a competitor, customer or other third party will not
initiate a private action under antitrust or other laws challenging the settlement with Barr. The
Company may not prevail in any such challenges or litigation and, in any event, may incur
significant costs in the event of an investigation or in defending any action under antitrust laws. From time to time, the Company is a party to other legal proceedings in the course of its
business. The Company, however, does not expect such other legal proceedings to have a material
adverse effect on its business or financial condition. 108 Table of Contents 17. Related Party Transactions The Company entered into a sponsored research agreement the Sponsored Research Agreement
and a related license agreement the License Agreement, each dated November8, 2004, with
Arisaph, which is now controlled by a limited partnership the Arisaph Limited Partnership
formed by the wife of Michael Jaharis, the Companys founder and Chairman Emeritus of the Companys
Board of Directors. At the time the agreements were executed, Mr.Jaharis directly controlled
Arisaph. Under the Sponsored Research Agreement, Arisaph has agreed to perform research on behalf
of the Company in the Field. The Sponsored Research Agreement, as amended on October1, 2005,
expires on December31, 2006, and provides for total payments by the Company during the extended
term of $38million. Arisaph commenced the sponsored research in 2003 in anticipation of the
execution of the definitive agreements. The Company paid $02million to Arisaph in 2003, $09
million, in 2004, and $08million in 2005 in connection with the Sponsored Research Agreement.
Under the License Agreement, Arisaph granted to the Company the right to obtain exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-bearing rights to all intellectual property in the Field developed during the
term of the Sponsored Research Agreement that ultimately is embodied in a patent claim, and
non-exclusive rights to all other intellectual property e.g., methods, processes, trade secrets
and technical data in the Field developed during the term of the Sponsored Research Agreement that
is not otherwise the subject of, or embodied in, a patent claim. During the term of the Sponsored
Research Agreement, Arisaph may not use the non-exclusive intellectual property in the Field for
commercial purposes. Following termination of the Sponsored Research Agreement, Arisaph will pay
to the Company royalties on income earned by Arisaph from the commercialization of any such
non-exclusive intellectual property within the Field. Arisaph conducts the sponsored research on
behalf of the Company pursuant to its sponsored research and license agreements with Tufts
University. On February1, 2005, the Company paid $40million of a proposed aggregate $80million
investment in Arisaph through the purchase of shares of a new series of convertible preferred stock
of Arisaph the SeriesF Preferred Stock. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions,
including Arisaph achieving certain agreed-upon milestones relating to its research and development
activities by August1, 2006, the Company will purchase an additional $40million of SeriesF
Preferred Stock. The investment is part of a $160million round of financing for Arisaph, with
the remaining $80million being provided by the Arisaph Limited Partnership under similar terms
and conditions as the Companys investment. Assuming consummation of the second $40million
investment and the recent increase in the size of the Arisaph stock option plan, the Company would
own approximately 24% and the Arisaph Limited Partnership would own or have the right to vote
approximately 42% of the outstanding common stock of Arisaph on a fully diluted basis. Under the
agreements related to the investment, the Company is entitled to designate three persons, and the
Arisaph Limited Partnership is entitled to designate seven persons, to Arisaphs 13-member Board of
Directors. Adrian Adams, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, has been
appointed by the Company to the Arisaph Board of Directors and has been elected by the directors of
Arisaph as Chairman. The Company has also appointed Ralf Rosskamp, the Companys Executive Vice
President, Research and Development and Dr.Marvin F. Blanford, the Companys Senior Vice
President, Drug Regulatory, Safety and Compliance to the Arisaph Board. Michael Jaharis, Steven
Jaharis, Robert E. Baldini, and Kevin T. Ferro, directors of Kos, have been appointed by the
Arisaph Limited Partnership to the Arisaph Board of Directors. After considering the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No46
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities on Interpretation of ARB No51, the Company
concluded that Arisaph does not constitute a variable interest entity that is required to be
consolidated by Kos. Instead, the Company accounts for its investment in Arisaph under the equity
method of accounting. Further, in accordance with the guidance offered by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid Assets Acquired in a Business Combination to be Used
in Research and Development Activities: A Focus on Software, Electronic Devices, and
Pharmaceutical Industries the AICPA Practice Aid, which establishes that the value related to
an investors proportionate interest in 109 Table of Contents assets acquired to be used in research and development activities that have no alternative
future use should be charged to income in the period that the acquiring company makes its equity
investment in common stock, Kos wrote-off its $40million investment in Arisaph. Such write-off
is included as a component of Research and development expenses in the accompanying condensed
consolidated statement of income for the year ended December31, 2005. In connection with the closing of Kos equity investment in Arisaph on February1, 2005,
Christopher P. Kiritsy accepted the position of President and Chief Executive Officer of Arisaph
and resigned, effective May20, 2005, from his position with the Company as Executive Vice
President, Corporate Development and Chief Financial Officer. Mr.Juan F. Rodriguez, the Companys
current Senior Vice President, Controller and Corporate Administration, was named Interim Chief
Financial Officer upon Mr.Kiritsys departure, until November1, 2005, when Mr.Kevin P. Clarke
was named Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. Effective with Mr.Kiritsys
employment termination, the Company and Mr.Kiritsy entered into a two-year consulting arrangement
the Consulting Agreement. Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, Mr.Kiritsy receives an annual
$5,000 consulting fee; the continued vesting, over the term of the Consulting Agreement, of stock
options received while Mr.Kiritsy was employed by Kos; and the reinstatement of such stock
options expiration period as the stock options granted to Mr.Kiritsy would have expired within
30days of the termination of employment. As such, Mr.Kiritsys current vested stock options,
and those that will vest through the term of the Consulting Agreement, will retain their original
expiration dates. In accordance with the provisions of the FASBs Interpretation No44,
Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, which addresses the accounting
consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award,
these modifications resulted in the Company recording stock option modification cost of $11
million, included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income as Selling, general and
administrative expense, for the year ended December31, 2005. Additionally, the Company recorded
stock option compensation cost associated with the Consulting Agreement of $39million, which is
included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income as Selling, general and
administrative expense for the year ended December31, 2005. The Company will continue to
recognize compensation cost related to these stock option awards throughout the term of the
Consulting Agreement as further vesting of these stock options occurs. In January2005, after receiving three competitive quotes, the Company purchased merchandise
from Ringware, Inc. for distribution to Kos employees to commemorate the Companys 2004
achievements. The total cost of this merchandise was approximately $96,500. Kevin T. Ferro, a
member of the Companys Board of Directors, and Mr.Ferros wife and mother-in-law have a
controlling ownership interest in Ringware, Inc. For more information regarding related party transactions, please refer to Note 18 of these
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 18. Subsequent Events On February22, 2006, the Company entered into a third IMA with one of its three largest
customers and as result, the Company had signed IMAs with its three largest customers as of such
date see Accounting for Product Returns and Inventory Management Agreements Impact on Revenue
Recognition in Note 2 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information
regarding IMAs. On February28, 2006, each of the Audit Committee and the Governance, Compliance and
Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors collectively, the Committees of the Company
approved limited use of a private jet fractionally-owned by Michael Jaharis, the Companys Chairman
Emeritus and principal shareholder, or an entity under his control, to transport members of the
Companys 110 Table of Contents board of directors and senior management accompanying Mr.Jaharis to or from Company-related
meetings or for Company-related business on limited occasions. The Committees determined that there may be instances when the Company would derive
substantial benefits as a result of having members of its board of directors and senior management
travel via private jet. The Committees considered a number of situations when commercial airline
travel may be impracticable or when the business interests of the Company would be served by having
members of management or the board travel together by private jet, as a result of time saved, more
productive use of time, confidentiality of discussions, and other circumstances when the business
interests of the Company would be served. For such occasions, the Committees authorized
reimbursement for a pro rata portion of the actual hourly costs to operate the jet multiplied by
the number of hours attributable to Company-related business, taking into account the number of
Company personnel and/or board members traveling on board with Mr.Jaharis, and provided that
reimbursement will in no event exceed the actual cost for use and operation of the jet. The
Committees will monitor the Companys use of and reimbursement for the jet on an ongoing basis to
ensure such use and reimbursement is reasonable and consistent with the Companys policies and
practices. 111 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and
