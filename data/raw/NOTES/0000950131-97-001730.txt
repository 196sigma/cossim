REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Tenneco Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Tenneco Inc. a Delaware
corporation and consolidated subsidiaries see Note 1 as of December 31,
1996 and 1995, and the related statements of income, cash flows and changes in
shareowners' equity for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1996. These financial statements and the schedule referred to below are
the responsibility of Tenneco Inc. management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Tenneco Inc. and
consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of
their operations, cash flows and changes in shareowners' equity for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, effective January 1,
1994, Tenneco changed its method of accounting for postemployment benefits.
Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The supplemental schedule listed in the
index to Part IV, Item 14 relating to Tenneco Inc. and consolidated
subsidiaries is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and
Exchange Commission rules and is not part of the basic financial statements.
The supplemental schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures
applied in the audits of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion,
fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to be set
forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements of Tenneco Inc.
and consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole.

TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. MERGER AND DISTRIBUTIONS
During 1996, Tenneco Inc. Old Tenneco undertook a series of transactions
to reorganize its historical businesses the Transaction. Prior to the
Transaction, Old Tenneco restructured its businesses such that the assets,
liabilities, and operations of its automotive Tenneco Automotive,
packaging Tenneco Packaging, and administrative services businesses
collectively, the Industrial Business were owned and operated by New
Tenneco Inc. New Tenneco, a new wholly-owned subsidiary of Old Tenneco,
and the assets, liabilities, and operations of its shipbuilding business the
Shipbuilding Business were owned and operated by Newport News Shipbuilding
Inc. Newport News, another wholly-owned subsidiary of Old Tenneco. On
December 11, 1996, Old Tenneco spun-off New Tenneco and Newport News by
distributing all of the common stock of each company to Old Tenneco
shareowners the Distributions. Following the Distributions, on December
12, 1996, a subsidiary of El Paso Natural Gas Company El Paso was merged
the Merger into Old Tenneco, which then consisted solely of Old Tenneco
remaining active businesses, principally in the energy industry, and certain
discontinued operations the Energy Business, with Old Tenneco surviving
the Merger as a subsidiary of El Paso. Immediately subsequent to the Merger,
Old Tenneco was renamed El Paso Tennessee Pipeline Co., and New Tenneco was
renamed Tenneco Inc.
In preparation for the Merger and Distributions, Old Tenneco realigned $38
billion of indebtedness the Debt Realignment through various cash tender
offers, debt exchanges, defeasances, and other retirements. The cash funding
required to consummate the Debt Realignment was financed through internally
generated cash, borrowings under new credit facilities of both Old Tenneco and
New Tenneco, borrowings under a new credit facility and other financings at
Newport News, and proceeds from the issuance of the 8 1/4% cumulative junior
preferred stock NPS Preferred Stock, which was retained by Old Tenneco in
the Merger. See Note 5, Long-Term Debt, Short-Term Debt, and Financing
Arrangements, for further discussion of the Debt Realignment.
Although the separation of the Industrial Business from the remainder of the
businesses, operations, and companies constituting Old Tenneco was structured
as a spin-off of New Tenneco for legal, tax, and other reasons, New Tenneco
succeeded to certain important aspects of the Old Tenneco business,
organization, and affairs, namely: i New Tenneco was renamed Tenneco Inc.
upon the consummation of the Merger; ii the Industrial Business conducted by
New Tenneco principally consists of Tenneco Automotive and Tenneco Packaging,
which combined represented over half of the assets, revenues, and operating
income of the businesses, operations, and companies previously constituting
Old Tenneco; iii New Tenneco Board of Directors consists of those persons
previously comprising Old Tenneco Board of Directors; iv New Tenneco
executive management consists substantially of Old Tenneco executive
management; and v New Tenneco retained as its headquarters the former
headquarters of Old Tenneco in Greenwich, Connecticut. Consequently, the
consolidated financial statements present the net assets and results of
operations of the Shipbuilding Business and the Energy Business as
discontinued operations. Shareowner approval of the Transaction was received
in a special meeting on December 10, 1996. Reference is made to Note 4,
Discontinued Operations, Disposition of Assets, and Extraordinary Loss.
In connection with the Distributions, one share of New Tenneco common stock
$01 par value was issued for each share of Old Tenneco common stock $500
par value and one share of Newport News common stock was issued for each five
shares of Old Tenneco common stock. Also, in connection with the Merger, Old
Tenneco shareowners received shares of El Paso common stock valued at
approximately $914 million in the aggregate in exchange for their shares of
Old Tenneco common and preferred stock. The treasury shares held by Old
Tenneco did not participate in the Merger and Distributions and such shares
were retained by Old Tenneco in the Merger. Subsequent to the Transaction, the
common equity of Tenneco Inc. relates solely to the shares of New Tenneco
renamed Tenneco Inc. common stock issued in the Distributions. In connection
with the Transaction, the accumulated retained earnings deficit of Old
Tenneco was eliminated. Retained earnings
43
TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
shown on the December 31, 1996 balance sheet represents net earnings losses
accumulated after the date of the Transaction. The effects of the issuance of
New Tenneco common stock in the Distributions, the retention of treasury
shares by Old Tenneco, and the elimination of Old Tenneco retained earnings
deficit have been reflected in the statements of changes in shareowners'
equity as Recapitalization of New Tenneco.
For purposes of these financial statements, Tenneco or the Company
refers to Old Tenneco and its subsidiaries prior to the Transaction, and to
Tenneco Inc., formerly known as New Tenneco Inc., and its subsidiaries
subsequent to the Transaction.
2. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Consolidation and Presentation
The financial statements of the Company include all majority-owned
subsidiaries. Investments in 20% to 50% owned companies where Tenneco has the
ability to exert significant influence over operating and financial policies
are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings since the date of
acquisition and cumulative translation adjustments. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
Income Taxes
Tenneco utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby
it recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, based upon management
estimates, it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized in a future period. The estimates utilized in the
recognition of deferred tax assets are subject to revision in future periods
based on new facts or circumstances.
Tenneco does not provide for U.S. income taxes on unremitted earnings of
foreign subsidiaries as it is the present intention of management to reinvest
the unremitted earnings in its foreign operations. Unremitted earnings of
foreign subsidiaries are approximately $610 million at December 31, 1996. It
is not practicable to determine the amount of U.S. income taxes that would be
payable upon remittance of the assets that represent those earnings.
In connection with the Distributions, Tenneco entered into a tax sharing
agreement with Newport News, Old Tenneco, and El Paso. The tax sharing
agreement provides, among other things, for the allocation among the parties
of tax liabilities arising prior to, as a result of, and subsequent to the
Distributions. For periods subsequent to the Distributions, Tenneco will be
liable for taxes imposed on the Industrial Business, Old Tenneco will be
liable for taxes imposed on the Energy Business, and Newport News will be
liable for taxes imposed on the Shipbuilding Business. In the case of federal
income taxes imposed on the activities of the Old Tenneco consolidated group
prior to the Distributions, Tenneco and Newport News are generally liable to
Old Tenneco for federal income taxes attributable to the Industrial Business
and Shipbuilding Business, respectively, and those entities have been
allocated an agreed-upon share of estimated tax payments made by Old Tenneco.
Changes in Accounting Principles
In October 1996, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued Statement of Position 96-1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities,
which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the recognition
and disclosure of environmental remediation liabilities. The provisions of the
statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1996.
The impact of this new standard is not expected to have a significant effect
on Tenneco financial position or results of operations.
44
TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
In June 1996, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards FAS No. 125, Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, which
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing
of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities. The statement is
effective for transactions occurring after December 31, 1996. The impact of
the adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a significant effect
on Tenneco financial position or results of operations.
Tenneco adopted FAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, in the first quarter of
1996. FAS No. 121 establishes new accounting standards for measuring the
impairment of long-lived assets. The adoption of this new standard did not
have a significant effect on Tenneco financial position or results of
operations.
Effective January 1, 1994, Tenneco adopted FAS No. 112, Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits. This accounting rule requires
employers to account for postemployment benefits for former or inactive
employees after employment but before retirement on the accrual basis rather
than the pay-as-you-go basis. Tenneco recorded an after-tax charge in 1994
of $39 million $22 per average common share, which was reported as a
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.
Inventories
At December 31, 1996 and 1995, inventory by major classification was as
follows:
1996 1995
MILLIONS
Finished  $ 408 $ 396
Work in   118  102
Raw   245  253
Materials and   107  87
$878 $ 838
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. A portion of total
inventories 46% and 47% at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively is
valued using the last-in, first-out method. All other inventories are valued
on the first-in, first-out FIFO or average methods. If the FIFO or
average method of inventory accounting had been used by Tenneco for all
inventories, inventories would have been $54 million, $48 million, and $46
million higher at December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.
Goodwill and Intangibles
At December 31, 1996 and 1995, goodwill and intangibles by major category

TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging
from 25 years to 40 years. Such amortization amounted to $21 million, $10
million, and $8 million for 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively, and is included
in the statements of income caption, Depreciation, depletion and
amortization.
Tenneco has capitalized certain intangible assets, primarily trademarks and
patents, based on their estimated fair value at date of acquisition.
Amortization is provided on these intangible assets on a straight-line basis
over periods ranging from 5 to 40 years. Such amortization amounted to $26
million in 1996 and was not significant during 1995 and 1994, and is included
in the statements of income caption, Depreciation, depletion and
amortization.
The majority of goodwill and intangibles at December 31, 1996, resulted from
the acquisition of the plastics division of Mobil Corporation in November 1995
and the 1996 acquisitions of The Pullman Company and its Clevite products
division Clevite and Amoco Foam Products Company, a unit of Amoco Chemical
Company Amoco Foam Products. See Note 3, Acquisitions, for further
information on these acquisitions.
Plant, Property, and Equipment, at Cost
At December 31, 1996 and 1995, plant, property, and equipment, at cost, by
major category was as follows:
1996  1995

Land, buildings, and  $1,339 $1,125
Machinery and  2,956 2,446
Other, including construction in progress.  575  567
$4,870 $4,138
Depreciation of Tenneco properties is provided on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives range from 10 to 40
years for buildings and improvements and from 3 to 25 years for machinery and
equipment. Depletion of timber and timberlands is provided on a unit-of-
production basis.
Notes Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Short-term notes receivable of $45 million and $53 million were outstanding
at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
At December 31, 1996 and 1995, the allowance for doubtful accounts and notes
receivable was $32 million and $24 million, respectively.
Environmental Liabilities
Expenditures for ongoing compliance with environmental regulations that
relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations,
and which do not contribute to current or future revenue generation, are
expensed. Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments indicate that
remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
Estimates of the liability are based upon currently available facts, existing
technology and presently enacted laws and regulations taking into consideration
the likely effects of inflation and other societal and economic factors. All
available evidence is considered including prior experience in remediation of
contaminated sites, other companies' clean-up experience, and data released by
the United States Environmental Protection Agency or other organizations. These
estimated liabilities are subject to revision in future periods
46
TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
based on actual costs or new information. These liabilities are included in
the balance sheet at their undiscounted amounts. Recoveries are evaluated
separately from the liability and, when assured, are recorded and reported
separately from the associated liability in the financial statements. For
further information on this subject, reference is made to Note 14,
Commitments and Contingencies.
Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share of common stock are based on the average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during each period. For purposes of computing
earnings per share, Series A preferred stock was included in average common
shares outstanding until its conversion into common stock in December 1994;
therefore, the preferred dividends paid were not deducted from net income to
determine net income to common stock. The inclusion of Series A preferred
stock in the computation of earnings per share was antidilutive for the year
and certain quarters in 1994. Other convertible securities and common stock
equivalents outstanding during each of the three years ended December 31,
1996, 1995, and 1994, were not materially dilutive. Tenneco preferred stock
was converted into El Paso common stock as part of the Merger; therefore,
preferred stock dividends have been deducted from income from discontinued
operations in determining earnings per share.
In 1992, 12,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to the Stock Employee
Compensation Trust SECT. Shares of common stock issued to a related trust
are not considered to be outstanding in the computation of average shares of
common stock outstanding until the shares are utilized to fund the obligations
for which the trust was established. During the years ended December 31, 1996,
1995, and 1994, the SECT issued 4,358,084, 2,697,770, and 2,464,721 shares,
respectively. All of the remaining shares held by the SECT were issued during
the first nine months of 1996 to fund employee benefits and other obligations
of the trust.
Under Tenneco stock repurchase programs, a total of approximately 17
million shares of Tenneco Inc. common stock have been acquired since December
1994. All treasury shares were retained by Old Tenneco in connection with the
Merger. For further information, reference is made to Note 8, Common Stock.
Allocation of Corporate Debt and Interest Expense
Tenneco historical practice has been to incur indebtedness for its
consolidated group at the parent company level or at a limited number of
subsidiaries, rather than at the operating company level, and to centrally
manage various cash functions. Consequently, corporate debt of Tenneco, prior
to the Transaction, has been allocated to the discontinued Energy Business and
the discontinued Shipbuilding Business based upon the ratio of the Energy
Business and Shipbuilding Business net assets to Tenneco consolidated net
assets plus debt. Interest expense, net of tax, has been allocated to
Tenneco discontinued operations see Note 4 based on the same allocation
methodology.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and
development expenses were $60 million, $42 million, and $27 million for 1996,
1995, and 1994, respectively, and were charged to Engineering, research, and
development expenses.
Realignment Charges
In 1996, the Company recorded charges of approximately $70 million in
connection with the reorganization of Tenneco Packaging folding carton
operations and the realignment of Tenneco Automotive: i Walker exhaust
system original equipment and aftermarket manufacturing operations in Europe,
ii Walker aftermarket operations in North America, and iii Monroe ride
control product line.
47
TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
In 1995, Tenneco Packaging recorded charges of approximately $30 million in
connection with the realignment of molded fiber and aluminum foil operations.
In 1994, Tenneco Automotive recorded charges of approximately $17 million in
connection with plant consolidations in Europe associated with the acquisition
of Gillet and approximately $5 million associated with the closing of a plant
in Ohio.
Foreign Currency Translation
Financial statements of international operations are translated into U.S.
dollars using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and
liabilities and the weighted average exchange rate for each applicable period
for revenues, expenses, and gains and losses. Translation adjustments are
reflected in the balance sheet caption, Cumulative translation adjustments.
Risk Management Activities
Tenneco is currently a party to financial instruments to mitigate its
exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These financial
instruments are accounted for on the accrual basis with gains and losses being
recognized based on the type of contract and exposure being hedged. After-tax
net gains or losses on foreign currency contracts designated as hedges of
Tenneco net investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognized in the
balance sheet caption, Cumulative translation adjustments. Net gains or
losses on foreign currency contracts designated as hedges of firm commitments
or other specific transactions are deferred and recognized when the offsetting
gains or losses are recognized on the hedged items.
In the statements of cash flows, cash receipts or payments related to the
financial instruments are classified consistent with the cash flows from the
transactions being hedged.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions in determining the reported amounts of Tenneco assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses. Reference is made to the Income Taxes
section of this footnote and Notes 11, 12, and 14 for additional information
on significant estimates included in Tenneco financial statements.
Reclassifications
Prior years' financial statements have been reclassified where appropriate
to conform to 1996 presentations.
3. ACQUISITIONS
In June 1996, Tenneco entered into agreements to acquire Clevite for
approximately $328 million and Amoco Foam Products for $310 million. Clevite
makes suspension bushings and other elastomeric parts for cars and trucks.
Upon completion of the Clevite acquisition in July 1996, Clevite operations
became part of Tenneco Automotive. Amoco Foam Products manufactures expanded
polystyrene tableware, hinged-lid food containers, packaging trays, and
industrial products for residential and commercial construction applications.
Tenneco closed the acquisition of Amoco Foam Products in August 1996, and
Amoco Foam Products became part of Tenneco Packaging. Also during 1996,
Tenneco completed the acquisitions of or investments in various other
businesses and joint ventures, principally in the automotive parts industry,
for total consideration of approximately $110 million.
A preliminary allocation of the purchase price has been made for these
acquisitions. A final determination of the purchase price allocation will be
made upon the completion of certain ongoing appraisals; however,
48
TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
management does not believe that any adjustments to the preliminary purchase
price allocation will be material to Tenneco financial position or results
of operations.
In November 1995, Tenneco Packaging acquired the plastics division of Mobil
Corporation for $13 billion. The plastics business is one of the largest
North American producers of polyethylene and polystyrene consumer and food
service packaging. The following unaudited pro forma information of Tenneco
illustrates the effect of the plastics business acquisition as if it had
occurred at the beginning of 1994, after giving effect to certain pro forma
adjustments including amortization of the excess purchase price, depreciation,
and other adjustments based on the purchase price allocation related to the
acquisition, together with estimates of the related income tax effects.

beginning of 1994, or the results that may be attained in the future.
Also during 1995, Tenneco Packaging completed additional acquisitions of
eight paperboard packaging businesses and two specialty packaging businesses
for a total purchase price of approximately $196 million. In addition, Tenneco
Automotive completed four acquisitions in 1995 for a total purchase price of
approximately $54 million.
All of the acquisitions discussed above have been accounted for as
purchases; accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the assets
purchased, and the liabilities assumed based on their fair values. The excess
of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is
included in the balance sheet caption, Goodwill and intangibles, net.

distribution of the common stock of Newport News to the holders of Old Tenneco
common stock. As part of the Distributions, Newport News retained the net

debt which had been issued during November 1996 in connection with the Debt
Realignment. See Note 1, Merger and Distributions, for additional

Farm and Construction Equipment Operations
In June 1994, Tenneco completed an initial public offering IPO of
approximately 29% of the common stock of Case Corporation Case, the holder
of Tenneco farm and construction equipment segment. In November 1994, a
secondary offering of Case common stock reduced Tenneco ownership interest
in Case to approximately 44%. Combined proceeds from the two transactions was
$694 million, net of commissions and offering expenses. The combined gain on
the transactions was $36 million, including a $7 million tax benefit. In an
August 1995 public offering, Tenneco sold an additional 161 million shares of
Case common stock for net proceeds of approximately $540 million. The sale
resulted in a gain of $101 million and reduced Tenneco ownership in Case
from 44% to 21%. In December 1995, Tenneco sold to a third party a
subordinated note receivable due from Case, which was received as part of the
reorganization preceding the Case IPO, for net proceeds of $298 million and
recognized a gain of $32 million. In March 1996, Tenneco sold its remaining
152 million shares of common stock of Case in a public offering. Net proceeds
of approximately $788 million were received, resulting in a gain of $340
million, net of $83 million in income tax expense.
Net assets as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and results of operations for

Disposition of Assets
In the second quarter of 1996, Tenneco Packaging entered into an agreement to
form a joint venture with Caraustar Industries whereby Tenneco Packaging sold
its two recycled paperboard mills and a fiber recycling operation and brokerage
business to the joint venture in return for cash and an equity interest in the
joint venture. Proceeds from the sale were approximately $115 million and the
Company recognized a $50 million pre-tax gain in the second quarter of 1996.
In 1995, Tenneco sold certain facilities and assets, principally at its
Tenneco Packaging segment. Proceeds from these dispositions totaled
approximately $56 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $15 million.
During 1994, Tenneco disposed of several assets and investments, including a
facility, machinery and equipment at Tenneco Packaging. Proceeds from these
dispositions were $16 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $5 million.
Gains and losses on the sale of businesses and assets have been included in
Other income, net for the accompanying statements of income.
Extraordinary Loss
As discussed further in Note 5, Long-Term Debt, Short-Term Debt and
Financing Arrangements, Tenneco completed the Debt Realignment to realign and
divide its consolidated indebtedness in contemplation of the Merger and
Distributions. As a result of the Debt Realignment, Tenneco recognized an
extraordinary loss of approximately $236 million, net of a tax benefit of
approximately $126 million. This extraordinary loss consists principally of the
fair value paid in the cash tender offers and the fair value of debt exchanged
in the debt exchange offers in excess of the historical net carrying value for
the debt tendered and exchanged.
52
TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
In June 1994, an extraordinary loss of $5 million was recorded, net of an
income tax benefit of approximately $2 million, for the redemption premium
resulting from the prepayment of debt.
5. LONG-TERM DEBT, SHORT-TERM DEBT, AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS
In contemplation of the Merger and Distributions, Tenneco initiated the Debt
Realignment to restructure, realign, and divide its consolidated indebtedness.
As part of the Debt Realignment, Tenneco completed certain cash tender offers
for approximately $15 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes
and debentures the Cash Tender Offers. In addition, approximately $19
billion aggregate principal amount of Old Tenneco notes and debentures were
exchanged, in a noncash transaction, into notes and debentures of New Tenneco
and were recorded by New Tenneco based on the fair value of such debt on the
date of exchange the Exchange Offers. Certain other components of
Tenneco historical consolidated short-term and long-term debt were defeased,
redeemed or retired in the Debt Realignment. The cash funding requirements of
the Debt Realignment were financed with internally generated cash, new
borrowings by Old Tenneco, Newport News and New Tenneco and proceeds from the
issuance of the NPS Preferred Stock by Old Tenneco. All obligations relating
to the NPS Preferred Stock and all borrowings under the Old Tenneco credit
facility and the other remaining debt of the Energy Business, including the
debt which was not tendered or exchanged in the Debt Realignment, were
retained by Old Tenneco in the Merger. Similarly, all borrowings made by New
Tenneco and Newport News in connection with the Debt Realignment were retained
by Tenneco and Newport News, respectively, after the Distribution.
Subsequent to the Merger and Distributions, the majority of Tenneco long-
term debt consists of the notes and debentures exchanged pursuant to the
Exchange Offers and the majority of its short-term debt consists of commercial
paper borrowings. The summary of long-term and short-term debt amounts at
December 31, 1995, presented below represents the historical consolidated
indebtedness of Tenneco, the majority of which was subject to the Debt
Realignment, and includes a reduction for the amount of corporate debt
allocated to the net assets of the discontinued Energy Business and
Shipbuilding Business. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting

TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
At December 31, 1996, Tenneco principal credit facility was a $175
billion committed financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks and other
financial institutions which expires in 2001. Committed borrowings under this
credit facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at the borrower
option, either i a rate consisting of the higher of Morgan Guaranty Trust
Company of New York prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 50 basis
points; ii a rate of LIBOR plus a margin determined based on the credit
rating of Tenneco long-term debt; or iii a rate based on money market
rates pursuant to competitive bids by the syndicate banks.
The credit facility requires that the Company consolidated ratio of debt
to total capitalization not exceed 70%. Compliance with this requirement is a
condition for any incremental borrowings under the credit facility and failure
to meet the requirement enables the syndicate banks to require repayment of
any outstanding loans after a 30-day cure period. In addition, the credit
facility imposes certain other restrictions, none of which are expected to
limit the Company ability to operate its business in the ordinary course.
6. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

includes amounts allocated to net assets of discontinued operations.
Asset and Liability Instruments
The fair value of cash and temporary cash investments, receivables, accounts
payable, and short-term debt was considered to be the same as or was not
determined to be materially different from the carrying amount. At December
31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, Tenneco aggregate customer and long-term
receivable balance was concentrated by industry segment as follows: Tenneco
Automotive, 69% and 77%, respectively, and Tenneco Packaging, 31% and 23 respectively.
Long-term debt--The fair value of fixed-rate long-term debt was based on the
market value of debt with similar maturities and interest rates.
Instruments With Off-Balance-Sheet Risk
Foreign Currency Contracts--Tenneco utilizes foreign exchange forward
contracts to hedge the translation effects of Tenneco investment in net
assets in certain foreign subsidiaries. Pursuant to these arrangements,
Tenneco recognized aggregate after-tax translation gains losses of $31
million, $3 million and $2 million for 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively,
which have been included in the balance sheet caption, Cumulative translation
adjustments.
In the normal course of business, Tenneco and its foreign subsidiaries also
routinely enter into various foreign currency forward purchase and sale
contracts to hedge the transaction effect of exchange rate movements

on receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. These foreign
currency contracts generally mature in one year or less.
In managing its foreign currency exposures, Tenneco identifies naturally
occurring offsetting positions and then hedges residual exposures. The
following table summarizes by major currency the contractual amounts of
foreign currency contracts utilized by Tenneco:

Based on exchange rates at December 31, 1996 and 1995, the cost of replacing
these contracts in the event of non-performance by the counterparties would
not have been material.
Guarantees--At December 31, 1996 and 1995, Tenneco had guaranteed payment
and performance of approximately $15 million, primarily with respect to
letters of credit and other guarantees supporting various financing and
operating activities.

potential tax benefits of $119 million and $83 million at December 31, 1996
and 1995, respectively, which were not recognized in the statements of income
when generated. These benefits resulted primarily from foreign tax loss
carryforwards which are available to reduce future foreign tax liabilities. At
December 31, 1996, Tenneco had tax benefits of $114 million from foreign net
operating loss carryforwards which do not expire.
8. COMMON STOCK

treasury stock held at December 31, 1995, were retained by Old Tenneco in the
Merger. See Note 1, Merger and Distributions.
Stock Repurchase Plans
In 1996, Tenneco completed the $500 million common stock repurchase program
initiated in December 1994. In 1995, Tenneco announced two additional
repurchase programs, one for up to 3 million shares and another for 25
million shares. Purchases executed through the programs were made in the open
market or in negotiated purchases. Under these programs, approximately 17
million shares have been acquired at a total cost of over $750 million. All
treasury stock purchased under these programs became the treasury stock of Old
Tenneco.

Stock Plans
Tenneco Inc. Stock Ownership Plan--In May 1994 Tenneco adopted the 1994
Tenneco Inc. Stock Ownership Plan the 1994 Stock Ownership Plan, effective
as of December 8, 1993. This plan provided Tenneco the latitude to grant a
variety of awards, such as common stock, performance units, and stock options,
to officers and key employees of the Tenneco companies. In conjunction with
the Merger, all options held by employees of the Energy Business were vested
and any unexercised options were cancelled as of December 11, 1996. In
connection with the Distributions, options held by employees of the
Shipbuilding Business were cancelled as of December 11, 1996, and were
subsequently replaced with options granted under a new stock
59
TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
ownership plan adopted by Newport News. All Old Tenneco stock options granted
to New Tenneco employees prior to the Distributions were, in connection with
the Distributions, cancelled and replaced with options to purchase New Tenneco
common stock pursuant to a new stock ownership plan adopted by New Tenneco in
December 1996 the 1996 Stock Ownership Plan. The options were replaced
with the appropriate number of New Tenneco options so that the aggregate
option value thereof immediately after the Distributions equaled the aggregate
value thereof immediately before the Distributions. The 1994 Stock Ownership
Plan was terminated effective as of December 11, 1996.
The 1996 Stock Ownership Plan permits the granting of a variety of awards,
including common stock, restricted stock, performance units, stock
appreciation rights, and stock options to officers and employees of Tenneco.
Tenneco can issue up to 17,000,000 shares of common stock under the 1996 Stock
Ownership Plan, which will terminate December 31, 2001.
Key Employee Restricted Stock and Performance Shares--Tenneco has granted
restricted stock and restricted units under various employee restricted stock
plans to certain key employees. These awards generally require, among other
things, that the employee remain an employee of Tenneco during the restriction
period. Tenneco has also granted performance shares to certain key employees
which will vest based upon the attainment of specified goals within four years
from the date of grant. During 1996, 1995, and 1994, Tenneco granted 465,075,
481,625 and 395,840 shares and units, respectively, with a weighted average
fair value based on the price of Tenneco stock on the grant date of $4854 4362, and $5291 per share, respectively. Any restricted stock and
performance shares awarded after the Distributions will be issued under the
1996 Stock Ownership Plan. At December 31, 1996, no restricted shares or
performance shares were outstanding.
Under another arrangement, restricted stock or restricted units are issued
annually to each member of the Board of Directors who is not also an officer
of Tenneco. During 1996, 1995, and 1994, 3,300, 3,000, and 2,500 restricted
shares were issued at a weighted average fair value of Tenneco Inc. stock on
the grant date of $4825, $4288, and $5394 per share, respectively. In
December 1996, Tenneco adopted a new restricted stock and unit plan for each
member of the Board of Directors who is not also an officer of Tenneco. At
December 31, 1996, 23,464 restricted shares were outstanding under the new
plan.
In conjunction with the Transaction, all outstanding restricted shares and
performance shares as of November 1, 1996, were vested and Tenneco recognized
an after-tax compensation expense of $18 million, of which approximately $7
million related to restricted stock and performance shares awarded to
employees of the Energy Business and Shipbuilding Business.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan--In June 1992 Tenneco initiated an Employee
Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP. The ESPP allows U.S. and Canadian Tenneco
employees to purchase Tenneco Inc. common stock at a 15% discount. Each year
employees participating in the ESPP may purchase shares with a discounted
value not to exceed $21,250. Under the ESPP, Tenneco sold 657,936, 633,495,
and 588,325 shares to employees in 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively. The
weighted average fair value of the employee purchase right, which was
estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the assumptions
described below except that the average life of each purchase right was
assumed to be 90 days, was $1084 and $939 in 1996 and 1995, respectively.
The ESPP was terminated as of the date of the Distributions. The Company
adopted a new employee stock purchase plan effective April 1, 1997. At
December 31, 1996, Tenneco had reserved 2,500,000 shares to be issued pursuant
to the new employee stock purchase plan.

Tenneco applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, to its stock-based compensation plans. Tenneco
recognized after-tax stock-based compensation expense in 1996 of $27 million,
of which $9 million related to restricted stock and performance shares awarded
to employees of the Energy Business and the Shipbuilding Business. Stock-based
compensation expense recognized in 1995 and 1994 was not material. Had
compensation costs for Tenneco stock-based compensation plans been
determined in accordance with FAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, based on the fair value at the grant dates for the awards under
those plans, Tenneco pro forma net income to common stock and earnings per
average common share for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, would
have been lower by $14 million, or $08 per average common share, and $7
million, or $05 per average common share, respectively.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
Stock Employee Compensation Trust SECT
In November 1992, Tenneco established the SECT to fund a portion of its
obligations arising from its various employee compensation and benefit plans.
Tenneco issued 12,000,000 shares of treasury stock to the SECT in exchange for
a promissory note of $432 million that accrued interest at the rate of 78%
per annum. At December 31, 1996, all shares have been utilized.
Shareholder Rights Plan
In connection with the Distributions, New Tenneco Inc. adopted a Shareholder
Rights Plan the Plan, which is substantially the same as the provisions of
the Old Tenneco Shareholder Rights Plan adopted in 1988. The Plan was adopted
to deter coercive takeover tactics and to prevent a potential acquiror from
gaining control of Tenneco without offering a fair price to all Tenneco Inc.
shareholders. Under the Plan, each outstanding share of Tenneco Inc. common
stock receives one Right, exercisable at $130, subject to adjustment. In the
event a person or group acquires 20% or more of the outstanding Tenneco Inc.
common stock other than pursuant to an offer for all shares of such common
stock that is fair and in the best interests of Tenneco Inc. and its
shareholders, or has in the judgment of the Tenneco Inc. Board of Directors
acquired a substantial amount of common stock under certain motives deemed
adverse to Tenneco best interests, each Right entitles the holder to
purchase shares of common stock or other securities of Tenneco Inc. or, under
certain circumstances, of the acquiring person, having a value of twice the
exercise price. The Rights, under certain circumstances, are redeemable by
Tenneco Inc. at a price of $02 per Right. The Plan is scheduled to terminate
in 1998.
Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
Under the Tenneco Inc. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan,
holders of Tenneco Inc. common stock may apply their cash dividends and
optional cash investments to the purchase of additional shares of Tenneco Inc.
common stock.
9. PREFERRED STOCK
Tenneco had 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock $01 par value authorized
at December 31, 1996, and had 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized
at December 31, 1995. No shares of preferred stock were outstanding at
December 31, 1996. Tenneco has designated and reserved 3,500,000 shares of the
preferred stock as junior preferred stock for the Shareholder Rights Plan.
In connection with the Transaction and as part of the Debt Realignment, Old
Tenneco issued the NPS Preferred Stock in November 1996 for proceeds of
approximately $296 million. The proceeds from the issuance were used to fund a
portion of the cash tender offers made in connection with the Debt Realignment
and other cash requirements preceding the Merger. As a result of the Merger,
the obligations relating to the NPS Preferred Stock remained with Old Tenneco.
In December 1991, Tenneco issued 17,870,350 Depositary Shares, each
representing one-half of a share of a new series of cumulative preferred stock
designated as Series A preferred stock. On December 16, 1994, Tenneco
exercised its option to call all of the outstanding shares, which were
converted into shares of Tenneco Inc. common stock. In addition, $11 million
was paid for dividends on the Series A preferred stock that were accrued but
unpaid at the conversion date.
Tenneco $740 and $450 preferred stock the Preferred Stock, issues
had a mandatory redemption value of $100 per share an aggregate of $139
million at December 31, 1995. Tenneco recorded these preferred stocks at
their fair value at the date of original issue an aggregate of $250 million
and made periodic accretions
62
TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
of the excess of the redemption value over the fair value at the date of
issue. Such accretions are included in the statements of income caption,
Preferred stock dividends as a reduction of net income to arrive at net
income to common stock. As part of the Merger, the Preferred Stock was
acquired by El Paso in exchange for El Paso common stock. Consequently, the
Preferred Stock has been included in the net assets of discontinued operations
in the accompanying balance sheet.

balance sheet of $304 million and $301 million, respectively. At December 31,
1996, $293 million of minority interest resulted from the December 1994 sale
of a 25% preferred stock interest in Tenneco International Holding Corp.
TIHC to a financial investor. TIHC holds certain assets including the
capital stock of Tenneco Canada Inc., Monroe Europe N.V., Monroe Australia
Proprietary Limited, Walker France S.A. and other subsidiaries included in the
Tenneco Automotive segment. For financial reporting purposes, the assets,
liabilities, and earnings of TIHC and its subsidiaries are consolidated in
Tenneco financial statements, and the investor preferred stock interest
has been recorded as Minority interest in the balance sheet.
Dividends on the TIHC preferred stock are based on the issue price $300
million times a rate per annum equal to 112% over LIBOR and are payable
quarterly in arrears on the last business day of each quarter. The weighted
average rate paid on TIHC preferred stock was 683% and 730% for 1996 and
1995, respectively. Additionally, beginning in 1996, the holder of the
12,000,000 shares of preferred stock is entitled to receive, when and if
declared by the Board of Directors of TIHC, participating dividends based on
the operating income growth rate of TIHC. For financial reporting purposes,
dividends paid by TIHC to its financial investors have been recorded in
Tenneco statements of income as Minority interest.
11. POSTRETIREMENT AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
Postretirement Benefits
Tenneco has postretirement health care and life insurance plans that cover
substantially all of its domestic employees. For salaried employees, the plans
cover employees retiring from Tenneco on or after attaining age 55 who have
had at least 10 years service with Tenneco after attaining age 45. For hourly
employees, the postretirement benefit plans generally cover employees who
retire pursuant to one of Tenneco hourly employee retirement plans. All of
these benefits may be subject to deductibles, copayment provisions, and other
limitations, and Tenneco has reserved the right to change these benefits.
Tenneco postretirement benefit plans are not funded.

by Newport News in the Distributions. Consequently, the accrued postretirement
benefit amounts for those discontinued businesses are excluded from the

Note:The accrued postretirement benefit cost has been recorded based upon
certain actuarial estimates as described below. Those estimates are subject to
revision in future periods given new facts or circumstances.
The net periodic postretirement benefit cost from continuing operations for
the years 1996, 1995, and 1994 consist of the following components:
1996 1995 1994
MILLIONS
Service cost for benefits earned during the year. $ 4  $ 3  $ 4
Interest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. 11  10  10
Net amortization of unrecognized  1  1  1
Net periodic postretirement benefit cost. $14  $12  $13
The initial weighted average assumed health care cost trend rate used in
determining the 1996, 1995, and 1994 accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation was 6%, 7%, and 8%, respectively, declining to 5% in 1997 and
remaining at that level thereafter.
Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage-point
in each year would increase the 1996, 1995, and 1994 accumulated
postretirement benefit obligations by approximately $13 million, $12 million,
and $10 million, respectively, and would increase the aggregate of the service
cost and interest cost components of the net postretirement benefit cost for
1996, 1995, and 1994 by approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $1 million,
respectively.
The discount rates which are based on long-term market rates used in
determining the 1996, 1995, and 1994 accumulated postretirement benefit
obligations were 775%, 775%, and 825%, respectively.

Postemployment Benefits
Tenneco adopted FAS No. 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits, in the first quarter of 1994. This accounting rule requires
employers to account for postemployment benefits for former or inactive
employees after employment but before retirement on the accrual basis rather
than the pay-as-you-go basis. Implementation of this rule reduced 1994 net
income by $39 million, net of income tax benefits of $26 million, which was
reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
12. PENSION PLANS
Tenneco has retirement plans that cover substantially all of its employees.
Benefits are based on years of service and, for most salaried employees, on
final average compensation. Tenneco funding policies are to contribute to
the plans amounts necessary to satisfy the funding requirement of federal laws
and regulations. Plan assets consist principally of listed equity and fixed
income securities. Also included in the table below are pension obligations
and assets retained by Tenneco related to certain former employees of
Tenneco discontinued operations.
As part of the Transaction, Tenneco retained the liabilities and related
assets for pension benefits under the Tenneco Inc. Retirement Plan the
TRP, including amounts related to employees of the Energy Business and
Shipbuilding Business accrued through the last day of the month in which
Merger and Distributions were consummated. Consequently, the disclosures below
as of December 31, 1996, include all TRP pension obligations and assets
retained by Tenneco subsequent to the Transaction. Certain other pension
plans, principally related to hourly personnel of the Shipbuilding Business,
were retained by Newport News in the Distributions, and are excluded from the
disclosures herein for all periods.

14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Capital Commitments
Tenneco estimates that expenditures aggregating approximately $350 million
will be required after December 31, 1996, to complete facilities and projects
authorized at such date, and substantial commitments have been made in
connection therewith.
Lease Commitments
Tenneco holds certain of its facilities, equipment and other assets under
long-term leases. The minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable
operating leases with lease terms in excess of one year are $167 million, $133
million, $119 million, $112 million, and $109 million for the years 1997,
1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively, and $243 million for subsequent
years. Of these amounts, $100 million for 1997, $79 million for 1998, $79
million for 1999, $79 million for 2000, $79 million for 2001, and $23 million
for subsequent years are lease payment commitments to financial investors the
Lessor for certain mill and timberlands assets.
Following the initial lease period, Tenneco may, under the provisions of the
lease agreements, extend the leases on terms mutually negotiated with the
Lessor or purchase the leased assets under conditions specified in the lease
agreements. If the purchase options are not exercised or the leases are not
extended, Tenneco will make a residual guarantee payment to the Lessor of
approximately $650 million, which will be refunded up to the total amount of
the residual guarantee payment based on the Lessor subsequent sales price
for the leased assets. Throughout the lease period, Tenneco is required to
maintain the leased properties.
Commitments under capital leases were not significant to the accompanying
financial statements. Total rental expense for continuing operations for the
years 1996, 1995, and 1994, was $179 million, $171 million, and $161 million,
respectively, including minimum rentals under non-cancelable operating leases
of $151 million, $148 million, and $143 million for the corresponding periods.

TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
Tenneco Packaging various lease agreements require that it comply with
certain covenants and restrictions, including financial ratios that, among
other things, place limitations on incurring additional funded debt as
defined by the agreements. Under the provisions of the lease agreements, in
order to incur funded debt, Tenneco Packaging must maintain a pretax cash flow
coverage ratio, as defined, on a cumulative four quarter basis of a minimum of
20, subsequently modified to 125 through December 31, 1996. Tenneco
Packaging was in compliance with all of its covenants at December 31, 1996.
Litigation
Tenneco and Newport News have received letters from the Defense Contract
Audit Agency the DCAA, inquiring about certain aspects of the
Distributions, including the disposition of the TRP. The DCAA has been advised
that i the TRP will retain the liability for all benefits accrued by the
Newport News salaried employees through December 31, 1996, ii the Newport
News salaried employees will not accrue additional benefits under the TRP
after December 31, 1996, and iii no liabilities or assets of the TRP will be
transferred from the TRP to any plan maintained by Newport News. A
determination of the ratio of assets to liabilities of the TRP attributable to
Newport News will be based on facts, assumptions and legal issues which are
complicated and uncertain; however, it is likely that the U.S. Government will
assert a claim against Newport News with respect to the amount, if any, by
which the assets of the TRP attributable to its employees are alleged to
exceed the liabilities. Tenneco, with the full cooperation of Newport News,
will defend against any claim by the U.S. Government, and in the event there
is a determination that an amount is due to the U.S. Government, Tenneco and
Newport News will share the obligation for such amount plus the amount of
related defense expenses, in the ratio of 80% and 20%, respectively. At this
preliminary stage, it is impossible to predict with certainty any eventual
outcome regarding this matter; however, Tenneco does not believe that this
matter will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
position or results of operations.
Tenneco and its subsidiaries are parties to various other legal proceedings
arising from their operations. Tenneco believes that the outcome of these
proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will have no material effect
on the financial position or results of operations of Tenneco Inc. and its
subsidiaries.
Environmental Matters
Tenneco and its subsidiaries are subject to a variety of environmental and
pollution control laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which they
operate. Tenneco has provided reserves for compliance with these laws and
regulations where it is probable that a liability exists and where Tenneco can
make a reasonable estimate of the liability. The estimated liabilities
recorded are subject to change as more information becomes available regarding
the magnitude of possible clean up costs and the timing, varying costs, and
effectiveness of alternative clean up technologies. However, Tenneco believes
that any additional costs which arise as more information becomes available
will not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of
operations of Tenneco.
