DATA  A.Description of Business
Mercury Computer Systems, Inc. the Company
or Mercury designs, manufactures and markets high-performance embedded computer systems and software. The primary areas of business for the Company are defense electronics, which includes radar, signals intelligence, sonar, smart
weapons, and imagery applications; imaging and visualization solutions, which includes life sciences medical diagnostic imaging and biotechnology, geosciences oil and gas exploration, and simulation applications; and commercial OEM solutions,
which includes semiconductor test inspection, reticle inspection, mask writing, and telecommunications test applications. These markets have computing needs that benefit from the unique system architecture developed by the Company.  B.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  BASIS OF
PRESENTATION  The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements for fiscal years 2004 and 2003, including
amounts for auction rate securities, cash, treasury stock, and inventory, have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal year 2005 presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the previously reported net income or shareholders
equity.  In connection with preparation of the accompanying
financial statements, the Company concluded that it was appropriate to classify its investments in auction rate securities as short-term available-for-sale marketable securities. Previously, such investments were classified as cash and cash
equivalents. Accordingly, the Company has revised the classification to exclude from cash and cash equivalents $130,300 and $10,000 at June30, 2004 and 2003, respectively of auction rate securities, and to include such amounts as short-term
available-for-sale marketable securities. In addition, the Company has made corresponding adjustments to the accompanying statements of cash flows to reflect the gross purchases and sales of these securities as investing activities. As a result,
cash used in investing activities increased by $120,300 and $10,000 for the fiscal years ended June30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This change in classification does not affect previously reported cash flows from operations or cash flows from
financing activities.  USE
OF ESTIMATES  The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from system sales is recognized upon shipment
provided that title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured, and customer acceptance criteria,
if any, have been successfully demonstrated.  Certain contracts
with customers require the Company to perform tests of its products prior to shipment to ensure their performance complies with the Companys published product specifications and, on occasion, with 
48  MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
additional customer-requested specifications. In these cases, the Company conducts such tests and, if they are completed successfully, includes a written
confirmation with each order shipped. As a result, at the time of each product shipment, the Company believes that no further customer testing requirements exist and that there is no uncertainty of non-acceptance by its customer. In the limited
instance that customer payment is conditioned upon final acceptance testing by the customer at its own facility, the Company does not recognize any revenue until the final acceptance testing has been completed and written confirmation from the
customer has been received.  For multiple-element arrangements,
the Company defers the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price that is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered. For a delivered item to be considered a separate unit,
the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis, there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement, and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be
considered probable and substantially within the control of the Company. The Company also defers the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance, which represents deferred revenue. Fair value is the price charged when the same or
similar element is sold separately.  Installation of the
Companys products requires insignificant effort that does not alter the capabilities of the Companys products and may be performed by its customers or other vendors. If an order includes installation or training services that are
undelivered at the time of product shipment, the Company defers revenue equal to the fair value of the installation or training obligations until such time as the services have been provided. The Company determines these fair values based on the
price typically charged to its customers who purchase these services separately.  For transactions involving the licensing of standalone software products and of software that is not incidental to the product, the Company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement,
delivery of the software has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. The Companys standalone software products are not deemed essential to the functionality of any hardware
system and do not require installation by the Company or significant modification or customization of the software. The fair value of maintenance agreements related to standalone software products is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of
each maintenance agreement.  In limited circumstances, the
Company engages in long-term contracts to design, develop, manufacture or modify complex equipment. For these contracts, the Company recognizes revenue using the percentage-of-completion method of contract accounting, measuring progress towards
completion based on contract cost incurred to date as compared with total estimated contract costs. The use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs, including
assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the contract, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, anticipated increases in wages and prices for subcontractor services and materials, and the availability of subcontractor
services and materials. The Companys estimates are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of its engineers, program managers and other personnel, who review each long-term contract monthly to assess the contracts schedule,
performance, technical matters and estimated cost at completion. When adjustments in estimated contract costs are determined, such revisions may have the effect of adjusting in the current period the earnings applicable to performance in prior
periods. Anticipated losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which determined.  The Company does not provide its customers with rights of product return, other than those related to warranty provisions that permit repair or replacement of defective goods. The Company accrues for anticipated
warranty costs upon product shipment. 
49  MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
DEFERRED REVENUES AND
CUSTOMER ADVANCES  Deferred
revenues consist of deferred product revenue and, to a lesser extent, deferred service revenue. Deferred product revenue represents amounts that have been invoiced to customers, but are not yet recognizable as revenue because one or more of the
conditions for revenue recognition have not been met. Deferred service revenue represents amounts invoiced to customers for annual maintenance contracts, which are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangements. Customer advances represent
deposits received from customers on an order.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  Cash equivalents, consisting of money market funds and U.S. government and U.S. government agency issues with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at
the date of purchase, are carried at fair market value.  MARKETABLE SECURITIES  The Company classifies investments in marketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and periodically re-evaluates such classification. There were no securities classified as trading or
held-to-maturity as of June30, 2005 and 2004. Securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair market value. Unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities are included, net of tax, in accumulated other
comprehensive income until disposition of the security. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in other income or expense. For determinations of gain or loss,
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.  The fair market value of cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in marketable securities represents the quoted market prices at the balance sheet dates. Debt securities with maturities at date of
purchase of greater than 90 days but less than one year are classified as short-term marketable securities. Debt securities that have remaining maturities of greater than one year at date of purchase are classified as long-term marketable
securities.  The Company invests in auction rate securities,
among other financial instruments. Auction rate securities are debt instruments with interest rates that generally reset every 7 to 28 days. Despite the long-term nature of their stated contractual maturities, the Company has the ability to quickly
liquidate investments in auction rate securities. Accordingly, these investments are classified as short-term.  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK  Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. At June30, 2005 and
2004, the Company had approximately $9,516 and $7,223, respectively, on deposit or invested with its primary financial and lending institution. There are no significant concentrations of investments in corporate debt securities with any single
issuer of debt securities.  The Company provides credit to
customers in the normal course of business. Collateral is not required for accounts receivable, but ongoing credit evaluations of a customers financial condition are performed. At June30, 2005, four customers accounted for 61% of the
Companys receivables. At June30, 2004, five customers accounted for 64% of the Companys receivables. 
50  MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
INVENTORY  Inventory is stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in,
first-out FIFO basis, or market value. On a quarterly basis, the Company uses consistent methodologies to evaluate inventory for net-realizable value. The Company records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory, consisting of on-hand and
non-cancelable on-order inventory in excess of estimated usage.  GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS  Acquired intangible assets result from the Companys acquisition of Myriad Logic, Inc., the TGS Group, Advanced Radio Corporation and Momentum
Computer, Inc. see Note G, and consist of identifiable intangible assets, including completed technology, licensing agreements, customer backlog and customer relationships. Acquired intangible assets are reported at cost, net of accumulated
amortization and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of four to five years. Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of the acquired net assets in a business acquisition exceeded the fair values of the
identifiable assets on the date of purchase. Goodwill is not amortized in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually, on a reporting
unit basis, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying
amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess.  LONG-LIVED ASSETS  Long-lived assets primarily include property and equipment and acquired intangible assets. The Company periodically
evaluates its long-lived assets for events and circumstances that indicate a potential impairment in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The Company reviews long-lived assets
for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. Each impairment test is based on a
comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset as compared to the recorded value of the asset. If impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis. 
FAIR VALUE
OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  The Companys financial instruments include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, Company-owned employee life insurance policies, mortgage notes payable, and convertible notes. The carrying amount of cash equivalents and accounts
receivable approximate their fair value due to their short maturities. The carrying amount of Company-owned life insurance policies are recorded at cash surrender value, which approximates fair value. Also, based on borrowing rates currently
available to the Company for the mortgage notes payable, the carrying value of notes payable approximates fair value. As of June30, 2005 and 2004, the fair values of the Companys convertible notes, based upon market quotations, were
approximately $132,969 and $133,125, respectively, compared to the carrying value of $125,000 at each year end. 
51  MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Equipment under capital lease
is recorded at the present value of the minimum lease payments required during the lease period. Depreciation is based on the following estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method:  Computer equipment
2to3years
Machinery and equipment
5 years
Furniture and fixtures
5 years
Buildings
15and30years
Building improvements
10 years
Expenditures for
additions, renewals and betterment of property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. As assets are retired or sold, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from
the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations.  CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS  The Company capitalizes software development costs incurred after a
products technological feasibility has been established and before it is available for general release to customers. Amortization of capitalized software costs commences once the product is available for general release and is computed on an
individual product basis based on the greater of athe ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to total anticipated gross revenues for that product, or bthe straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the
product. Software development costs qualifying for capitalization were not material for any of the years ended June30, 2005, 2004 and 2003.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  IN-PROCESS
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  The Company values tangible and intangible assets acquired through its business acquisitions at fair value, including in-process research and development IPRD. The Company determines IPRD through established valuation techniques
for various projects for the development of new products and technologies and expenses IPRD when technological feasibility is not reached.  ADVERTISING COSTS 
The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. During the years ended June30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, advertising expenses totaled $50, $141
and $210, respectively, and were included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.  PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY  The Companys product sales generally include a one-year hardware warranty. At time of product shipment, the Company
accrues for the estimated cost to repair or replace potentially defective products. Estimated 
52  MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
warranty costs are based upon prior actual warranty costs for substantially similar transactions. The following table presents the changes in the
Companys product warranty liability:  YearsEndedJune30 2005 2004 Balance at beginning of year 1,135 925 Accruals for warranties issued during the year 2,108 2,147 Settlements made during the year 1,623 1,937 Balance at end of year 1,620 1,135  INCOME TAXES  The
Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance against net
deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  NET INCOME PER SHARE  Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus additional common shares that would
have been outstanding if potential dilutive common shares had been issued for granted stock options.  Calculations of diluted earnings per share also include the effect of the assumed conversion of the Companys contingently convertible notes into
shares of common stock, including an increase to reported net income for interest expense net of tax incurred on the notes that would not have been incurred if the debt had, in fact, been converted.  ACCOUNTING FOR
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  The Company has several stock-based employee compensation plans. The Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense is recorded for options issued to employees in fixed amounts with fixed exercise prices at least equal to the fair market value of the
Companys common stock at the date of grant. The Company has adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS
No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure, SFAS 123 through disclosure only. All stock-based awards to non-employees are accounted for at their fair value in accordance with SFAS
No123.

The weighted-average
grant-date fair values for options granted during the years ended June30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $1779, $1508 and $1409, respectively, per option. The fair value of options at date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:  Years Ended June30 2005 2004 2003 Option life

Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:  Years Ended June30 2005 2004 2003 Option life

respectively. 
54  MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
In addition, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $0, $176 and $864 during the
years ended June30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, for stock options granted to non-employees. Such amounts reflect the fair value of options upon their final vesting dates as well as adjustments for the revaluation of a portion of the
unvested options at each period-end. The fair value of these non-employee stock option grants was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  On June20, 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of outstanding stock options granted to employees and officers with an exercise price of $2900
or greater. As a result, vesting was accelerated for options to purchase 552,097 shares of the Companys common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $3221 and exercise prices per share ranging from $2926 to $4085, including
options to purchase 51,565 shares held by the Companys executive officers and no options held by the Companys non-employee directors. By taking this action, the Company expects to reduce the effects of the Companys required
adoption on July1, 2005 of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards new standard, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires companies to recognize stock-based compensation
expense associated with stock options based on the fair value method. No compensation expense was recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of operations for the year ended June30, 2005 related to this action as these options had
no intrinsic value on June20, 2005. For purposes of the SFAS No123 pro forma calculation above, the expense related to the options that were accelerated was $63 million, net of tax, for the year ended June30, 2005.  COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/
LOSS  Comprehensive income/ loss consists
of net income and other comprehensive income loss, which includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on investments in marketable securities. For purposes of comprehensive income/loss disclosures, the
Company does not record tax provisions or benefits for the net changes in the foreign currency translation adjustment, as the Company intends to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. Items included in Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income/ Loss at June30, 2005 and 2004 were as follows:  YearsEndedJune30 2005 2004 Cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment 458 376 Unrealized loss on marketable securities 385 196 843 180  FOREIGN CURRENCY  Local
currencies are used as the functional currency for the Companys subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Japan. The accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in effect at
period-end for assets and liabilities and at average exchange rates during the period for results of operations. The related translation adjustments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. Gains losses
resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense and were immaterial for all periods presented.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  In September 2004, the FASB announced that it had reached a final consensus
with respect to Emerging Issue Task Force 04-08 EITF 04-08, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per 
55  MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Share. The FASBs final consensus states that shares of common stock contingently issuable pursuant to contingent convertible securities should be
included in diluted earnings per share computations if dilutive regardless of whether their market price triggers or other contingent features have been met. EITF 04-8 was effective for all periods ending after December15, 2004 and
required the Company to include an additional 4,134,962 shares, using the if-converted method under which net income was also adjusted to exclude imputed interest expense, net of tax, in the Companys computation of diluted earnings per share
for the fiscal year ended June30, 2005. The consensus required the Company to restate prior period earnings per share for comparative purposes.  In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No151, Inventory Costs SFAS 151. SFAS 151
amends ARB No43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing. This statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material, and requires those items be recognized as current
period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal. In addition, this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 151 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of
operations.  In December 2004, the FASB issued two Staff
Positions, FSP FAS 109-1 and FSP FAS 109-2, in response to the Job Creations Act of 2004. Under FSP FAS 109-1, the FASB decided that the deduction for qualified domestic production activities should be accounted
for as a special deduction under FAS 109. Under FSP FAS 109-2, the FASB addresses the appropriate point at which a company should reflect in its financial statements the effects of the one-time tax benefit on the repatriation of foreign earnings.
The adoption of FSP FAS 109-1 and FSP FAS 109-2 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.  In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R. SFAS
123R replaces SFAS 123 and supersedes APB 25. SFAS 123R focuses primarily on the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. SFAS 123R requires companies to recognize in the statement
of operations the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions. SFAS 123R was originally expected to be effective for the Company
beginning in its third quarter of fiscal year 2005. In April 2005, the effective date was amended by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, SFAS 123R is now effective for the Company as of July 1, 2005. Accordingly, the Company will
adopt SFAS 123R in its first quarter of fiscal year 2006. The Company expects to use the modified-prospective transition method and will not restate prior periods for the adoption of SFAS 123R. Although the Company is currently evaluating the
provisions of SFAS 123R and its implications on its employee benefit plans, the Company believes that the adoption of this standard, based on the terms of the options outstanding at June30, 2005, will have a material effect on its net income
in fiscal year 2006.

were greater than the average market price of the Companys common stock during those periods and therefore would be antidilutive.  During the year ended June30, 2005, the Company adopted the guidance of Emerging Issue Task Force Issue No04-08 EITF 04-08,
The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share. The guidance requires the inclusion in diluted earnings per share calculations of the effect of notes that are contingently convertible into shares of common
stock, with restatement of reported amounts for periods prior to adoption. As a result of this adoption, the calculations of diluted net income per share for the years ended June30, 2005 and 2004 iinclude 4,134,962 shares and 717,000
shares, respectively, which represent common stock issuable under the Companys outstanding Convertible Senior Notes issued in fiscal year 2004 and iireflect increases to reported net income of $2,354 and $404, respectively,
representing the interest expense including amortization of deferred financing costs incurred, net of tax, related to the Convertible Senior Notes that would not have been incurred had the notes been converted into common stock, as assumed per the
calculation. Diluted earnings per share for the year ended June30, 2004 were restated from $105 to $103 as a result of this standard.

G.Acquisitions  TGS Group  On May6, 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of TGS Group TGS Group. TGS Group is a leading supplier of three-dimensional 3Dimage
processing and visualization software to diverse end markets including life sciences medical imaging and biotechnology, geoscience earth sciences including oil and gas exploration, and simulation commercial and defense. TGS Group is
headquartered in Bordeaux, France, has operations in Berlin, Germany and San Diego, California and has sales offices in Italy and the United Kingdom. The results of TGS Groups operations have been included in the consolidated financial
statements since May6, 2004.  The initial purchase price
of TGS Group consisted of cash of $12,880 as well as 257,511 shares of the Companys common stock. As of June30, 2004, the Company had paid $9,438 of the cash consideration and had not yet issued the required shares of common stock due to
a dispute with the sellers regarding the determination of the final purchase price. Also as of that date, the Company had recorded $7,512 as a current liability and $630 as a long-term other liability for the expected remaining purchase price
payable to the former TGS Group shareholders. As a result, as June30, 2004, the Company had recorded a preliminary TGS Group purchase price of $19,302, including $1,722 of transaction costs directly related to the acquisition. 
59  MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The initial purchase price as of the acquisition date was allocated based on the fair value of the
acquired assets and liabilities assumed as follows:  Accounts receivable 1,315 Property and equipment 287 Other assets 1,179 Acquired intangible assets customer relationships, completed technology and licensing agreement 3,520 Goodwill 19,142 Current liabilities 5,022 Short-term notes payable repaid subsequent to acquisition date 897 Deferred tax liabilities, net 222 19,302  In December 2004, the
Company entered into an agreement with the former shareholders of TGS Group which finalized the purchase price for the acquisition and, as a result, paid $2,812 in cash and issued 206,554 shares of the Companys common stock valued at $4,813,
representing the final payment of purchase price. The final purchase price of $19,415 for the acquisition of TGS Group consisted of total cash payments of $12,880, 206,554 shares of the Companys common stock valued at $4,813, and $1,722 of
transaction costs directly related to the acquisition. The finalization of the purchase price resulted in a $113 increase to goodwill recorded.  This transaction resulted in an amount of purchase price that exceeded the estimated fair values of tangible and intangible assets, which was allocated to
goodwill. The Company believes that the high amount of goodwill relative to identifiable intangible assets was the result of two factors: 1the overall rationale for the transaction, which was to gain entry into the 3D medical image
processing market by combining the acquired technology of TGS Group with that of the Company, in order to move from 2D image processing to an integrated 3D application layer product and offer this product to the Companys existing customers;
and 2the buyer-specific synergies of expected additional revenues and associated profits, resulting from the integration of the Companys and TGS Groups technology and the exploitation of this technology primarily with the
Companys customers. In addition, at the acquisition date, TGS Group had a working capital deficit, which caused the Company to acquire net liabilities of approximately $34 million excluding intangible assets and had the direct effect of
increasing the amount of recorded goodwill by a corresponding amount.  The amortization period for the acquired intangible assets subject to amortization is five years. The goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the acquisition are not deductible for tax purposes.  The pro forma statements reflecting the operating results of TGS Group and
the Company as if TGS Group had been acquired as of July1, 2003 would not differ materially from the operating results of the Company as reported.  Advanced Radio Corporation  On June1, 2004, Mercury completed its acquisition of Advanced Radio Corporation ARC. ARC is a developer of radio frequency RF products used in
signals intelligence SIGINT applications and commercial opportunities such as wireless infrastructure testing. The total purchase price of $6,760 consisted of $6,603 in cash plus $157 of transaction costs directly related to the acquisition. The
transaction also includes contingent payments of up to an aggregate of $1,500 payable over three years, which will be treated recorded as compensation expense if and as it is incurred. The results of ARCs operations have been included in the
Companys consolidated financial statements since June1, 2004. 
60  MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The purchase price as of the acquisition date was allocated based on the fair value of the acquired assets and
liabilities assumed as follows:  Other assets 76 Property and equipment 82 Inventory 299 Acquired intangible assets completed technology 770 Deferred tax assets, net 131 Goodwill 5,642 Current liabilities 339 Short-term notes payable repaid subsequent to the acquisition date 401 In-process research and development 500 6,760  In connection with the
acquisition of ARC, the Company obtained an appraisal of the fair value of its intangible assets. This appraisal valued at $500 in-process research and development IPRD of two projects for the development of new products and technologies.
Because the technological feasibility of these products under development had not been established and no future alternative uses existed, the purchased IPRD was expensed at the acquisition date and recorded in selling, general and
administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The value of the purchased IPRD was determined using the residual income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net
present value. Each project was analyzed to determine the technological innovations included; the utilization of core technology; the complexity, cost and time to complete development; any alternative future use or current technological feasibility;
and the stage of completion.  This transaction resulted in an
amount of purchase price that exceeded the estimated fair values of tangible and intangible assets, which was allocated to goodwill. The Company believes that the high amount of goodwill relative to identifiable intangible assets relates to several
factors including: 1the Companys willingness to pay for potential buyer-specific synergies related to market opportunities for combined existing product offering; 2the Companys ability to protect its existing competitive
advantages within certain product lines of its Defense Electronics Group; and 3the potential to continue developing next-generation technologies from the acquired workforce.  The amortization period for the acquired intangible assets subject to amortization is five years. The goodwill and other
intangible assets associated with the acquisition are not deductible for tax purposes.  The pro forma statements reflecting the operating results of ARC as if ARC had been acquired as of July1, 2003 would not differ materially from the operating results of the Company as reported.  Momentum Computer, Inc.  On September30, 2004, the Company acquired a 35% voting interest in
Momentum Computer, Inc. MCI, a manufacturer and developer of high-performance embedded processor and I/O boards, for $3,087, which was recorded at that time as an investment in an unconsolidated entity. On December7, 2004, the Company
acquired the remaining 65% voting interest in MCI in a separately negotiated transaction, paying $10,500 in cash and agreeing to pay up to $12,000 of additional cash consideration if specified operating income and revenue targets are achieved by MCI
over 24 months following the closing. Any such additional payments will be recorded as additional goodwill if and when incurred. 
61  MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The total purchase price for the acquisition of MCI was $13,790, consisting of cash payments of
$13,587, and transaction costs of $203 directly related to the acquisition. The Company believes the acquisition of MCI will expand the breadth of the Companys product offerings across all of its markets. The results of MCIs operations
have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements since December7, 2004. Prior to that date, the Company recorded its pro rata share of MCIs net operating results under the equity method of accounting.
The purchase price as of December7, 2004 was allocated
based upon the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed as follows:  Cash 388 Accounts receivable 1,157 Property and equipment 452 Other assets 192 Inventory 1,975 Customer relationships 1,900 Customer backlog 549 Goodwill 9,575 Current liabilities 1,759 Short-term notes payable repaid subsequent to acquisition date 500 Deferred tax liabilities, net 139 13,790  This transaction
resulted in an amount of purchase price that exceeded the estimated fair values of tangible and intangible assets, which was allocated to goodwill. The Company believes that the high amount of goodwill relative to identifiable intangible assets was
the result of several factors including: 1the Companys ability to gain protection against competition and to mitigate loss of market share at the low end of the market through expanded product and service offerings; 2the
Companys intentions to utilize its financial stability and market presence to attract new customers that were not then customers of MCI; 3buyer-related synergies resulting from the Companys leverage of its sales force and
intellectual property to attract new contracts and revenue.  The acquired intangible assets, other than goodwill, will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of six years for customer relationships and four months for customer backlog. The goodwill and other intangible assets associated with
the acquisition are not deductible for tax purposes.  Pro forma
financial information reflecting the operating results of MCI and the Company as if MCI had been acquired as of July1, 2003 would not differ materially from the operating results of the Company, as reported.

I.Commitments and Contingencies  LEGAL CLAIMS  In July 1999, a former employee alleged a wrongful termination action against the Company and certain officers of the Company. The Company and the former
employee entered into binding arbitration in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and, in December 2002, an award was entered in favor of the employee on one count, and for the Company and certain officers of the Company on the remainder of the counts.
As a result of the award, the Company recorded an expense in the second quarter of fiscal year 2003 of approximately $800, which was included in selling, general and administrative expenses. In January 2003, all obligations under the award were
settled.  The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and
claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe these actions will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of its operations.  PURCHASE COMMITMENTS
As of June30, 2005, the Company has entered into
non-cancelable purchase commitments for certain inventory components used in its normal operations. The purchase commitments covered by these agreements are for less than one year and aggregate approximately $18,907.  In June 2005, the Company entered into an alliance agreement with a third
party to purchase certain computer equipment and services. This alliance agreement is in effect until December 2011 and contains penalties for early termination and volume commitments. Aggregate purchase commitments over the six-year term of the
agreement total approximately $95,125, unless the Company terminates the agreement and pays penalties of up to $16,000 for early termination.  LEASE COMMITMENTS 
The Company leases certain facilities, machinery and equipment under operating leases expiring in various years through 2010. The leases contain
various renewal options. Rental charges are subject to escalation for increases in certain operating costs of the lessor. Rental expense during the years ended June30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $1,780, $1,100 and $930, respectively. Minimum

include provisions requiring the Company to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Companys customers, in connection with any patent, or any other
intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to the Companys products. These indemnification obligations generally run until the applicable statute of limitations lapses. The maximum potential amount of future
payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification obligations, in certain cases, is unlimited. The Company has never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification obligations.

Company completed a lending agreement with a commercial financing company, issuing two 730% senior secured financing notes the Mortgage Notes due November 2014. The original principal amount of the Mortgage Notes totaled $14,500. The Mortgage
Notes are collateralized by the Companys corporate headquarters, which consists of two buildings. The terms of the Mortgage Notes contain certain covenants, which, among other provisions, require the Company to maintain a specified minimum net
worth. The Mortgage Notes also include significant prepayment penalties. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the mortgage note agreements as of June30, 2005. The outstanding principal amount on the Mortgage Notes was $10,828 at
June30, 2005 and $11,599 at June30, 2004.  On
April29, 2004, the Company completed a private offering of $125,000 aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes the Notes, which mature on May1, 2024 and bear interest at 2%per year, payable semiannually in arrears in
May and November. The Notes are unsecured, rank equally in right of payment to the Companys existing and future senior debt, and do not subject the Company to any financial covenants.  The Notes are convertible into shares of the Companys common stock
contingent upon the occurrence of specified events. At the option of the holder, the Notes may be converted if, on or prior to May1, 2019, the closing price of Mercurys common stock exceeds $3628 for at least 20 trading days in a
specified 30-day period of each fiscal quarter. In addition, the Notes may be converted if, on any date after May1, 2019, the closing price of Mercurys common stock exceeds $3628. The Notes may also be converted at the option of the
holder if, at any time prior to May1, 2019, the average trading price of the Notes in a five-day consecutive trading period was less than $2963. The initial conversion rate is 330797 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, subject
to adjustment in certain circumstances, yielding an initial conversion price of $3023 per share. As of June30, 2005, no circumstances existed and no events had occurred that made the Notes convertible.  Upon certain events involving a change in control of the Company, the holders
of the Notes may elect to convert the Notes or require the Company to repurchase the Notes. The holders may also require the Company to repurchase the Notes, in whole or in part, on May1, 2009, 2014 or 2019 or if the Companys common
stock is neither listed nor approved for trading on specified markets.

At its option, the Company may redeem any of the Notes on or after May1, 2009 at a price equal
to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest.  Upon issuance of the Notes, the Company received net proceeds of $120,889 after offering expenses of $4,111, which were recorded as deferred financing costs in other long-term assets on the balance sheet and are being
amortized over the five-year term to May1, 2009, the first optional redemption date of the debt. For the year ended June30, 2005 and 2004, additional interest expense from the amortization of these deferred financing costs totaled $856
and $137, respectively. The unamortized balance of deferred financing costs totaled approximately $3,237 and $3,974 at June30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  Principal payments under the Mortgage Notes and the Notes are scheduled to be paid as follows:  YearEndingJune30 2006 831

ESPP and authorized 500,000 shares for future issuance. Under the plan, rights are granted to purchase shares of common stock at 85% of the lesser of the market value of such shares at either the beginning or the end of each six-month offering
period. The plan permits employees to purchase common stock through payroll deductions, which may not exceed 10% of an employees compensation as defined in the plan. During the two offerings in fiscal year 2005, the Company issued 36,469 and
27,248 shares of common stock to employees who participated in the plan at prices of $2111 and $2331, respectively. During the two offerings in fiscal year 2004, the Company issued 35,421 and 26,950 shares of common stock to employees who
participated in the plan at prices of $1562 and $2108, respectively. During the two offerings in fiscal year 2003, the Company issued 34,808 and 35,734 shares of common stock to employees who participated in the plan at prices of $1764 and
$1547, respectively. Shares available for future purchase under the ESPP totaled 126,388 at June30, 2005.  STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM  During the years ended June30, 2005 and 2003, the Company repurchased 873,459 shares and 387,000 shares, respectively,
of its common stock under various stock repurchase programs authorized by its Board of Directors. The amounts repurchased under these programs were approximately $250 million and $101 million during the years ended June30, 2005 and 2003,
respectively. As of June30, 2005, the Company had repurchased substantially all amounts then authorized under the program.  Effective July1, 2004, the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act was revised to eliminate the use of treasury shares by Massachusetts corporations.
As a result, all of the Companys treasury shares were automatically converted to unissued shares on July1, 2004.

The components of the Companys net deferred tax assets were as follows:  June30 2005 2004 Deferred tax assets Receivable allowances and inventory valuations 2,232 1,855 Accrued compensation 1,350 2,711 Property and equipment depreciation 622 State research and development tax credit carryforwards 4,170 3,149 Net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards of acquired businesses 3,505 3,672 11,257 12,009 Valuation allowance 1,667 2,210 Total deferred tax assets 9,590 9,799 Deferred tax liabilities Property and equipment depreciation 144 Acquired intangible assets 2,095 2,040 Other temporary differences 206 328 Total deferred tax liabilities 2,445 2,368 Net deferred tax assets 7,145 7,431  In fiscal year 2004,
the Company recorded deferred tax assets of $3,672 and deferred tax liabilities of $1,553 in connection with the acquisitions of TGS Group and ARC. As of the TGS Group acquisition date and as of June30, 2005 and 2004, management believed that
it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets acquired in the TGS Group acquisition would not be realized due to uncertainties surrounding the timing and amounts of future taxable income of TGS Group. Accordingly, the Company
established a valuation allowance of $2,018 upon the TGS Group acquisition and recorded an additional valuation allowance of in 2004 of $192 subsequent to the acquisition. If the Company realizes any tax benefit related to future utilization of the
acquired TGS Group deferred tax assets, the Company is obligated to pay the cash amount of such tax benefits to the sellers of TGS Group. Accordingly, no tax benefit would be recorded in the Companys statements of operations.  The Company did not establish any valuation allowance for the deferred tax
assets acquired upon the ARC acquisition, as such tax assets were and are expected to be realized in combination with Mercurys future taxable income. However, the Companys ability to use ARCs net operating loss carryforwards may be
limited under U.S tax laws, specifically section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.  In fiscal year 2005, the Company recorded initial deferred tax assets of $842 and deferred tax liabilities of $981 in connection with the acquisition of MCI. During the fiscal year ended June30, 2005 the
deferred tax asset associated with MCI increased to $1,255 and the corresponding deferred tax liability decreased to $684, resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $571 at June30, 2005. The Company did not establish any valuation allowance for
the deferred tax assets acquired as part of this acquisition as such tax assets are expected to be realized in combination with Mercurys future taxable income. However, the Companys ability to use MCIs net operating loss
carryforwards may be limited under U.S. tax laws, specifically section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.  During fiscal year 2005, the Companys valuation allowance decreased by $543 primarily as a result of the utilization carry forwards against taxable
income generated in fiscal year 2005. The Company reduced goodwill by $543 since the valuation allowance related to acquisitions of TGS Group and Momentum. 
70  MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
At June30, 2005, the Company had net operating loss and research and development credit
carryforwards of $9,670 and $715, respectively, which will expire between 2007 and 2025. At June30, 2005, the Company had state research and development credit carryforwards of $6,354, which begin to expire in 2015.  The Company files income tax returns in all jurisdictions in which it
operates. The Company has established reserves to provide for additional income taxes that may be due in future years as these previously filed tax returns are audited. These reserves have been established based upon managements assessment as
to the potential exposure attributable to permanent differences. All tax reserves are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant modification.  The cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is intended to be permanently reinvested and
for which U.S. income taxes have not been provided, totaled approximately $2,200 and $2,600 at June30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  On October22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act was signed into law. The Act contains a provision allowing U.S.
multinational companies a one-time incentive to repatriate foreign earnings at an effective tax rate of 525%. The Company is continuing to study this new provision but does not expect that it will have a material impact on future periods.
Determination of the potential deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.  M.Employee Benefit Plan  The Company maintains a qualified 401k plan. The 401k plan covers
employees who have attained the age of 21. Employee contributions to the 401k Plan may range from 1% to 15% of eligible compensation. During fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company matched employee contributions up to 3% of eligible
compensation. The Company may also make optional contributions to the plan for any plan year at its discretion. Expense recognized by the Company for matching contributions related to the 401k plan was $1,789, $736 and $1,396 during the years
ended June30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The
Company has a deferred compensation plan that allows eligible employees to defer up to 35% of their total compensation. The employee may elect to receive his or her account balance as a lump sum payment or as an annuity to be paid over a period not
to exceed 10 years beginning upon retirement or termination of employment. At June30, 2005 and 2004, the Company had a liability of $1,281 and $1,122, respectively, relating to amounts owed under the deferred compensation plan that were
classified as long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.  N.Operating Segment, Significant Customers and Geographic Information  Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise evaluated regularly by the Companys senior management in deciding how to allocate
resources and assess performance. The Company has four operating and reportable segments: Defense Electronics Group, Imaging and Visualization Solutions Group, OEM Solutions Group and Momentum Computer Group. These operating segments were determined
based upon the nature of the products offered to customers, the market characteristics of each operating segment and the Companys management structure.  The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note B, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Asset
information by reportable segment is not reported because the Company

does not produce such information internally. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Company began reporting its operating segment results on a fully
allocated basis. Segment information for the prior periods has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The following is a summary of the performance of the Companys operations by reportable segment:  Defense Electronics Group

payments as gains when received. The Company recognized a gain of $5,800 for the fiscal year ended June30, 2003. The Company received the final payments due from IBM for the sale of the SSBU in March 2003.  P.Related Party Transactions  A former member of the Companys Board of Directors, who resigned his
membership in September 2003, was a corporate officer of KLA-Tencor Corporation KLA-Tencor. In the ordinary course of business, KLA-Tencor purchases products from the Company. In fiscal years 2004 and 2003, revenues recognized by the Company from
KLA-Tencor were $17,693 and $8,924 respectively. As of June30, 2004, $5,831, was included in accounts receivable, representing amounts due from KLA-Tencor for purchases of the Companys products. As of June30, 2004, the Company had

into a contract with NDC Development Associates, Inc. Northland to perform design, development, permitting and management activities related to the construction of new corporate facilities. An officer and principal of Northland is an immediate
family member of the Companys chief executive officer. In January 2003, to assist with the design, permitting activities and oversight of the construction of a new facility, the Company entered into another agreement with Northland. The
Company paid Northland fees of $0, $251 and $226 for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company owed no amounts to Northland as of June30, 2005 and 2004.  In July 2004, the Company entered into a consulting contract with David Bertelli, the brother of the Companys Chief
Executive Officer and a former Vice President, for human resources consulting services. The Company paid David Bertelli $30 for consulting services during fiscal year 2005 and owed no amounts under this agreement as of June30, 2005.
Additionally, the Company paid $25 of life insurance premiums during fiscal year 2005 for the benefit of David Bertelli.  The Company has arrangements with other parties that do not meet the technical disclosure requirements of related parties and are not material in the
aggregate. These individual arrangements either fall under reporting thresholds or are with non-immediate family members of executive officers of the Company.

Q.Workforce Reduction  In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003, as part of the Companys cost cutting measures, the Company recorded charges
approximating $1,400 relating to the termination of 42 employees across all functional groups. The workforce reduction charges were reflected in the Companys consolidated statement of operations for the year ended June30, 2003 as
follows: $400 in cost of revenues, $600 in selling, general and administrative expense and $400 in research and development expense. The workforce reduction charges were attributable to the Companys reportable segments as follows: $983 for the
Defense Electronics Group, $193 for the Imaging and Visualization Solutions Group and $212 for the OEM Solutions Group. As of June30, 2004, all amounts related to this workforce reduction had been paid. Activity in the workforce reduction

Echotek is a market leader in the development of data acquisition products. The results of Echoteks operations will be included in our consolidated operations beginning September 2005.  On July25, 2005, the board of directors of Mercury authorized a share
repurchase program for up to $20,000 of the Companys currently outstanding common stock. The plan is intended to offset the potential dilutive impact of the issuance of shares in connection with the Companys employee stock option and
purchase plans. Repurchases of the Companys common stock may be made from time to time at managements discretion on the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions. 
74  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION UNAUDITED  The following sets forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly statements of operations data for each of the

IVS revenues increased
$07 million from the third quarter of fiscal year 2005 primarily due to sales of products used in MRI imaging systems.  Offsetting these increases were revenue declines of $39 million and $06 million within the OEM Solutions Group and Momentum Computer Group, respectively. Both declines were
primarily the result of order patterns of the respective customers of those groups relative to the third quarter of fiscal year 2005.

Offsetting the $160 million sequential growth within the Defense Electronics Group from the third quarter of fiscal year 2004 to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 was a
decline of $05 million in revenues within the Imaging and Visualization Solutions Group and a decline of $19 million in revenues within the OEM Solutions Group. Both declines were the result of order patterns of the respective customers of those
groups relative to the third quarter of fiscal year 2004.  Item 4.SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS  No matters were submitted to a vote of shareholders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June30, 2005.

76  MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys principal
executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:  Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and  Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.  Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2005. In making this assessment, our
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.  Based on our assessment, management concluded that, as of June30, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting
was effective according to those criteria.  Our
managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
which appears on page 42.  CHANGES IN INTERNAL
CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  There was no change in our
internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended June30, 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.  ITEM9B.OTHER INFORMATION  None.  PART III
