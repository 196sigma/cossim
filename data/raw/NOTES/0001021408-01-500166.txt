The Stockholders and Board of Directors
JLM Industries, Inc.
Tampa, Florida
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of JLM
Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2000 and
1999, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
loss income, of changes in stockholders' equity and of cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 8. These
financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and the financial statement schedule
based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31,
2000 and 1999, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also,
in our opinion, such consolidated financial statement schedule, when considered
in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in 2000 the Company
changed its method of accounting for certain inventories from the LIFO to the
FIFO method and, retroactively restated the 1999 and 1998 financial statements
for the change.

1. Description of Business
JLM Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries JLM or the Company is a leading
marketer and distributor of certain commodity chemicals, principally acetone
and phenol. The Company believes that it is the second largest marketer of
acetone and the fifth largest supplier of phenol in North America. JLM is also
a global distributor of olefins, principally propylene, as well as a variety of
other commodity, inorganic and specialty chemicals. In order to provide stable
and reliable sources of supply for its products, the Company i maintains
established supplier relationships with major chemical companies, ii
manufactures phenol and acetone at its Blue Island Plant and iii sources
acetone from its joint venture manufacturing operation. The Company principal
products, acetone, phenol and propylene, are used in the production of
adhesives, coatings, forest product resins, paints, pharmaceuticals, plastics,
solvents and synthetic rubbers. The Company sells its products worldwide to
over 1,000 customers.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of JLM
Industries, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiaries and a 501% interest in
Inquinosa, S.A. , a Spanish company acquired in July 1998 see Note 13. The
consolidated financial statements also included the accounts of JLM Industries
de Venezuela, C.A. through May 18, 2000, the date through which this entity was
a wholly owned subsidiary see Note 4. The principal operating subsidiaries
are JLM Marketing, Inc. JLM Marketing, JLM Chemicals, Inc. JLM
Chemicals, JLM Terminals, Inc. JLM Terminals, JLM International, Inc., JLM
Industries Europe B.V., JLM Chemicals Canada, Inc. JLM Canada, JLM
Chemicals Asia Pte. Ltd. and JLM Industries South Africa Proprietary
Limited. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. Investments in which the Company has a 20% to 50%
ownership interest are accounted for using the equity method.
Restatement
In the third quarter of 2000, the Company reported a change in the
accounting principle used to account for JLM Marketing inventory from the
last-in, first out LIFO method to the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
Accordingly, the Company financial statements have been retroactively
restated to adjust for this change in accounting principle. The retroactive
restatement resulted in an adjustment to the Company retained earnings as of
January 1, 1998, resulting in an increase of $546,806 over the originally
reported amount. In addition, net income was decreased by $833,673, net of tax,
for the year ended December 31, 1998. There was no impact from this change on
the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1999.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The Company
inventory has been determined using the FIFO method.
JLM enters into contracts whereby parties to the contracts agree to exchange
various quantities of inventory over a specified period of time. JLM records
these exchanges of inventory at the lower of cost or market. As of December 31,
2000 and 1999, JLM was owed approximately $148,000 and $718,000, respectively,
under these contracts which are included in inventory.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies--Continued
Other Investments
Other investments include investments in partnerships and marketable
securities. JLM accounts for certain of its investments in partnerships on the
equity basis and, accordingly, records its respective share of profits and
losses that are allocated in accordance with the partnership agreements.
Marketable securities are primarily held for trading purposes, and changes in
market value are recognized in operations when incurred.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the
straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful
lives.
A summary of the lives used for computing depreciation is as follows                              
15 and 315 years
Vehicles and  2 to 10 years
5 to 10 years
Furniture and  3 to 5 years
Leasehold  Life of lease Other Assets
Other assets consist primarily of the cash surrender values of life
insurance policies held on key employees, license fees and development costs
associated with land held for investment purposes.
On December 12, 1996, JLM entered into consulting and non-competition
agreements the Agreements with two independent third parties. The terms of
the Agreements require that the Company make payments of $230,000 per year,
payable semi-annually beginning January 1, 1997 through December 31, 2002, and
$470,000 on January 1, 2003. The Agreements cover the period from January 1,
1997 through December 31, 2006. The payments were capitalized and amortized
over the lives of the respective agreements. In 1999, the Agreements were
terminated, and unamortized payments of approximately $470,000 and $200,000
were written off December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999, respectively.
Goodwill and Other Intangibles
Goodwill and other intangibles resulting from business acquisitions see
Note 13, comprising cost in excess of net assets of businesses acquired,
customer lists, employee contracts and distribution rights are being amortized
over their estimated lives which range from 3 to 40 years.
Deferred Financing Costs
The costs incurred to obtain financing have been capitalized and are being
amortized to interest expense over the life of the related financing agreement
using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest
method. Amortization expense related to deferred financing costs was $60,149 36,111 and $8,333 during 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Income Taxes
JLM accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method as
required by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under this method,
deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary
differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years
to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax
basis of existing assets and liabilities. The effect of a tax rate change on
deferred taxes is recognized in operations in the period that the change in the
rate is enacted.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies--Continued
Other Comprehensive Income Loss
Other comprehensive loss income includes foreign currency translation
adjustments. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at
year-end exchange rates. Results of operations are translated at weighted
average rates for the year. The effects of exchange rate changes in translating
foreign financial statements are presented as a separate component of
stockholders' equity.
Foreign Exchange Contracts
From time to time, JLM enters into foreign exchange contracts as a hedge
against foreign accounts payable and receivables. Market value gains and losses
are recognized and the resulting credit or debit offsets foreign exchange gains
and losses on these payables and receivables. At December 31, 2000 and 1999,
JLM had no open foreign exchange contracts.
Stock-Based Compensation
As permitted by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, JLM
has elected to recognize stock-based compensation under Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and to disclose
in the consolidated financial statements the effects of SFAS No. 123 as if its
fair value recognition provisions were adopted. See Note 14 for additional
information on the Company stock-based compensation.
Income Loss Per Share
Basic income loss per share is computed by dividing income available to
common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted income loss per share reflects the potential
dilutive effect of securities which can consist of stock options and
restricted stocks that could share in earnings of the Company, unless the
inclusion of these potential dilutive effects results in antidilution. The
average market price of the Company common stock was less than the exercise
price of the options throughout the majority of 2000, 1999 and 1998. During
each of the years ended 2000, 1999 and 1998, the effect of these securities was
antidilutive.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment and passage
of title. The Company estimates and records provisions for quantity rebates and
sales allowances, if necessary, in the period the sale is reported.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission released Staff
Accounting Bulletin 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. This
pronouncement summarizes certain of the SEC staff views on applying generally
accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition. The Company was required
to conform its income recognition policies to SAB 101 for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2000. Compliance with the requirements of SAB 101 did not have a
material impact on the Company results of operations, financial position or
cash flows.
Uses of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
requires management to make estimates and assumptions
32           JLM INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies--Continued
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimated.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The estimated fair value of amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements have been determined by using available market information and
appropriate valuation methodologies. The carrying value of all current assets
and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of their short-
term nature. The fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying value
based on management estimates for similar issues, giving consideration to
quality, interest rates, maturity and other significant characteristics.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The carrying values of long-lived assets, including property and equipment,
goodwill and other intangibles, and investments, are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded value
cannot be recovered from undiscounted future cash flows.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to a
concentration of credit risk principally consist of trade accounts receivable.
Credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is generally diversified
due to the large number of entities comprising the Company customer base and
their dispersion across many different geographic regions. The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and requires
collateral, such as letters of credit or business insurance, in certain
circumstances.
Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, is effective for all fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS 133, as amended, establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging
activities. Under SFAS 133, certain contracts that were not formerly considered
derivatives may now meet the definition of a derivative. The Company will adopt
SFAS 133 effective January 1, 2001. The adoption of SFAS 133 did not have a
significant impact on the Company financial position, results of operations,
or cash flows.
In March 2000, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, which further clarifies APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. This interpretation
did not have a material impact on the Company financial position or its
results of operations.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the 1999 and 1998 consolidated financial statements have
been reclassified to conform to the 2000 presentation.

payments for each of the years 2001 through 2005 are approximately $95,000 55,000, $51,000, $40,000 and $16,000, respectively.
4. Other Investments
Investments in partnerships at December 31, 2000 and 1999, consisted
principally of the following Quimicos La Barraca, C.A. Quibarca
On May 19, 2000, the Company discontinued its operations conducted through
its subsidiary JLM Venezuela. As a subsidiary, JLM Venezuela accounts and
results of operations were included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements through May 18, 2000. Concurrently with the discontinuation of JLM
Venezuela and in order for the Company to maintain a presence in Venezuela, the
Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Inversiones 253-34, C.A. to
acquire a 49% minority equity interest in Quibarca, a distribution business
which was a direct competitor of JLM Venezuela in the Venezuelan market. The
Company believed that joining forces would not only reduce competition, but
would also allow the new entity to take advantage of cost synergies which, under
normal circumstances, would not be available. Significant terms of the agreement
included that each partner would a transfer selective assets into the joint
venture and b guarantee the solvency of the debtors owing accounts receivable
balances contributed by the respective partners to the joint venture. The
Company, in exchange for its 49% interest, contributed the net assets remaining
from JLM Venezuela which had an agreed upon fair market value of approximately
$2,500,000 which equaled the Company carrying value of the assets and cash
of approximately $400,000. The investment is accounted for using the equity
method, and the Company equity in earnings during the year ended December 31,
2000 was approximately $129,000. As of December 31, 2000, the Company
investment in Quibarca totaled approximately $3,000,000.
Phenol Plant Partnership
The Company holds a 2% interest in Mt. Vernon Phenol Plant Partnership
through its wholly owned subsidiary JLM Ind, Inc., an Indiana corporation.
The plant converts cumene into phenol that is marketed under contractual
agreements with GE Plastics. JLM has an exclusive agreement through 2002, and
thereafter                    34           JLM INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued 4. Other Investments--Continued
unless the agreement is terminated upon prior notice, to purchase all acetone
not used internally by GE Plastics produced at the Mt. Vernon Phenol Plant.
Based on its percentage ownership, JLM accounts for this investment using the
cost method. As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the amount of this investment
was approximately $496,000. During 2000 and 1999, JLM did not contribute to the
partnership or receive any distributions.
Asian Partnership
In 1997, the Company purchased a 250% interest in SK Asia and a 127%
interest in SK Trading, two Singapore-based companies participating in a
Vietnamese joint venture. The Vietnamese joint venture intended to construct a
chemical plant in Vietnam to produce dioctyl phthlate, a chemical used in the
production of plastics such as PVC. The Vietnamese joint venture also intended
to construct terminalling and storage facilities in Vietnam and Malaysia. In
January 2000, the Company exchanged its 25% interest in SK Asia and its 127%
interest in SK Trading, for a 49% interest in an existing terminal facility
which was named Siam JLM. In the first quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company has
recently made the decision to wind down the operations of JLM Siam. During
2000, the Company has estimated that the anticipated future undiscounted cash
flows will be insufficient to recover the carrying value of the Company
investment, and, accordingly, wrote off this investment.
Real Estate Partnerships
During 1999 and 1998, the Company held a 99% limited partnership interest in
Len-Kel Realty Limited Partnership Len-Kel. The investment was accounted
for using the equity method. As of December 31, 1998, the carrying value of
this investment was approximately $948,000. During the year ended December 31,
1998, the Company portion of Len-Kel loss was $48,000, which is reflected in
the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. In 1999, the investment
property was sold for approximately $600,000, resulting in a loss of
approximately $336,000 during the year ended December 31, 1999.
Other Investments
As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, JLM other investments totaled
approximately $217,000 and $485,000, respectively. Of these amounts,
approximately $161,000 and $410,000, respectively, are accounted for using the
cost method and approximately $56,000 and $75,000, respectively, are accounted
for using the equity method in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
Polyform
During 1999, the Company entered into a $3,000,000 loan agreement with
Polyform USA, LLC, with the objective of acquiring an equity interest in a
plastics manufacturing facility in Greece. In addition to a promissory note
from Polyform USA, LLC, the Company received a Guarantee and a Fiduciary
Transfer Agreement from Polyform MEPE, the owner of the plant facility in
Greece, pledging certain enumerated equipment located in Greece as security for
the promissory note. Polyform USA defaulted on the promissory note on January
27, 2000. The Company has filed suit in Florida to recover on the promissory
note and in Greece to enforce the guarantee and the Fiduciary Transfer
Agreement. The litigation in Florida is in discovery. The trial court in
Komotini, Greece has issued an order enforcing the Fiduciary Transfer
Agreement. Polyform MEPE has filed an appeal of this judgment. The Company has
also obtained an order from a court in Athens, Greece freezing all of Polyform
MEPE assets in Greece pending the outcome of the litigation on the guarantee.
Management has evaluated the collectibility of this receivable and has reduced
the $3,000,000 note receivable to its estimated fair market value and recorded
a loss of $1,500,000 during the year ended December 31, 2000.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Marketable Securities
JLM marketable securities held for trading purposes were approximately
$378,000 and $1,239,000, at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The
Company incurred losses of approximately $835,000 during the year ended
December 31, 2000, and gains of approximately $615,000 and $0 during the years

5. Olefins Terminal Corporation
Olefins Terminal Corporation OTC is a polymer grade propylene export
facility in Bayport, Texas. OTC is 50% owned by JLM and is accounted for on the
equity method. For the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, OTC had
net losses of approximately $2,422,331, $1,891,000 and $2,261,000,
respectively. During 1997, the Company investment in OTC was reduced to zero
due to the recognition of the Company pro rata share of OTC operating
losses. As the Company has no current financial commitments to OTC and does not
intend to make further investments, the Company will not record additional
losses on its investment until future operating income from OTC surpasses the
cumulative unrecorded operating losses or until any contingent payment
obligations are required. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had cumulative
unrecorded operating losses from OTC of approximately $3,244,000.
JLM provides OTC with financial and management services for a fee of
approximately $16,000 per month. JLM recorded management fees of approximately
$196,000 for each of the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998.

minimum current ratio and leverage ratio required under the Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement during the first and second quarters of 2000. In a
letter dated August 11, 2000, Citizens agreed to waive compliance with such
covenants up to and including September 30, 2000.
In the third quarter of 2000, the Company gave notice to Citizens that it
would not meet financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement for the

payable in foreign tax jurisdictions and the receipt of an overpayment of a
refund from the Internal Revenue Service.

Company valued at approximately $17,000, $30,500 and $72,000. The Company
entered into the transactions in order to assume certain tax liabilities
related to the vested portion of restricted stock received by the officers.
On October 16, 1998, the Company Board of Directors approved a Stock
Repurchase Program the Program whereby the Company can purchase up to 500,000 shares of its common stock. On September 6, 2000, the Company Board

11. Commitments and Contingencies
JLM is obligated under operating leases with remaining non-cancelable terms
of a year or more for office equipment, storage facilities and automobiles. The
approximate minimum annual rentals under these leases at December 31, 2000, are
as follows                                  
$2,083,000
1,674,000
1,146,000
683,000
2005 and   448,000
Total minimum lease  $6,034,000
Total rental expenses for all operating leases approximated $2,682,000 1,914,000 and $1,588,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
JLM is subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws,
rules, regulations and ordinances concerning emissions to the air, discharges
to surface and subsurface waters, and the generation, handling, storage,
transportation, treatment, disposal and import and export of hazardous
materials. JLM has engaged environmental counsel for four of their facilities:
the JLM Chemicals, Blue Island, Illinois facility; the JLM Terminals facility;
and the JLM Real Estate property. Regarding the JLM Chemicals facility, JLM
believes that the low levels of various organic compounds detected in the soil
and groundwater at the facility are the result of historical use of the
facility prior to the acquisition by JLM and/or migration from neighboring
facilities. JLM also believes that the likelihood of either state or federal
environmental regulatory agencies seeking remediation in the near term is low,
based on the location of the facility, the character of the area each of which
are factors in assessing risk and the fact that the site is pending removal
from the federal list of contaminated sites. Regarding the JLM Terminals, Inc.
facility and the JLM Realty property, JLM believes that ultimate liability for
remediation of soil and groundwater contamination rests with the previous owner
of the facility and/or a neighboring facility.                    42           JLM INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued 11. Commitments and Contingencies--Conmtinued
In 1998, the Company assumed from the previous owner of both the JLM
Terminals facility and the JLM Real Estate property, the implementation of
state approved Remedial Action Plans RAPs to address onsite petroleum
contamination at the sites. Compliance with the RAPs does not foreseeably
require any capital expenditures and the Company believes that the owners of
the neighboring properties may bear a significant portion of the responsibility
or any additional remediation. JLM does not believe that a material amount of
funds will be required to complete remediation at either site. Accordingly, the
Company has not accrued any amounts related to the remediation.
On May 26, 1999, the Company entered into an Option Agreement the
Option, for $1,100,000, to acquire 85% of the outstanding common shares of
GZ Holdings Inc. at a purchase price of $15,000,000. The Option was originally
scheduled to expire March 31, 2000. The Company had not exercised its option as
of December 31, 1999. In March 2000, the parties extended the option expiration
date to March 31, 2001 and amended the purchase price to $20,000,000. The
Company elected not to exercise this option and has written off the $1,100,000
in the fourth quarter of 2000.
During 1999, the Company entered into a sales contract with a third party to
sell phenol on a formula based price. Upon entering the contract, the Company
received $4,160,000 as a prepayment towards future purchases by the third
party. Volume commitments by the third party were 18 million pounds in 1999, 30
million pounds annually for each of the years 2000 through 2008. The prepayment
was recorded as deferred revenue and is being applied against purchases over
the agreement term. Sales exceeding the yearly volume under the contract will
be sold at market price. Additionally, the third party, over the agreement
term, has an option to increase the volume up to 45 million pounds in 2002 for
an additional prepayment of $1,700,000 by December 31, 2001. In March 2000, the
parties amended the agreement, which revised the formula based price. In
return, the Company received an additional $1,000,000 from the third party.
12. Profit-Sharing Plan
The Company has a defined contribution profit-sharing plan covering
substantially all of its employees. The Company contribution rate is
determined annually at the beginning of each plan year. In 1999 and 1998 the
Company matched 100% of the contribution of eligible employees, up to a maximum
amount of 6% of the employees' compensation. In 2000, there was no Company
contribution for non-union employees, but the Company made matching
contribution of 100% of the amount contributed by union employees up to a
maximum amount of 6% of the employees' compensation in accordance with their
collective bargaining agreement. The costs for this plan were approximately
$81,000, $376,000 and $395,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
13. Acquisitions
In September 1999, JLM acquired Colours and Industrial Chemicals Division of

unincorporated operating division of Societe Financiere d'Entreposage et de
Commerce International de l'Alcool, S.A., for $2,300,000, which was accounted

agreement called for additional annual payments equal to the greater of $50,000
or 25% of a defined net profit amount paid over a five year period beginning in
2000. In 2000 and 1999, the excess purchase price of $285,000 and $280,000,
respectively, were capitalized to goodwill and are being amortized over 20
years. Sofecia is a manufacturer and distributor of various formulations of

The proforma effects of the 1999 acquisitions on the 1998 and 1999 operating
results of the Company were insignificant.
Effective April 1, 1998, the Company completed the purchase of all of the
assets of Browning for $95 million. The purchase price consisted of an initial
payment of $75 million cash and a $2 million non-interest bearing promissory
note to be paid in equal installments over four years see Note 7. Browning
was founded in 1948, and is a major marketer of inorganic chemicals, with a
diversified product range serving both industrial and food processing markets
throughout the United States.
Effective April 1, 1998, JLM completed the acquisition of Tolson Transport
B.V., a Dutch company, Tolson Holland B.V., Holdings a Dutch company, and
Tolson Asia Pte., Ltd, a Singapore company through the purchase of all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the three companies, collectively the
Tolson Group, from their parent Tolson Holding, B.V., a Dutch company. The
total purchase price paid to Holdings for the Acquired Companies was $575
million, including the execution of a $29 million promissory note, subject to
certain adjustments as described below. The Tolson Group is a global
distributor and trader of methanol, solvents, aromatics and olefins. The
acquisition expanded the Company international chemical business especially

13. Acquisitions
The purchase price of the Tolson Group was determined based on a closing
valuation date of March 31, 1998, less excluded receivables as defined in the
Share Purchase Agreement and the execution of a $29 million promissory note
that accrues interest at the LIBOR rate plus 1%. The promissory note is payable
in five semi-annual installments of $350,000 with a lump-sum payment of $11
million due in May 2001 see Note 7. Based on the combined negative
shareholders' equity of the Tolson Group as of March 31, 1998, Tolson Holding.
B.V. contributed approximately $74 million to bring the combined negative
equity of the Tolson Group to zero. The Company is currently a plaintiff in a
litigation matter against Tolson for alleged misrepresentations made in
connection with the terms of the purchase agreement. Accordingly, the Company
did not make any payments to Tolson under the note during 2000.
The purchase of the Tolson Group excluded certain receivables, as defined in
the Share Purchase Agreement. For such excluded receivables, JLM will collect
such receivables on a best efforts basis and JLM will receive a commission, as
defined in the Share Purchase Agreement, for actual collections made. In 2000
and 1999, goodwill was reduced by approximately $214,000 and $341,000 to
reflect the reversal of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset which was
realized in 2000 and 1999.
On July 3, 1998, the Company acquired 501%, of the outstanding common stock
of Inquinosa, a Spanish company. The purchase price for Inquinosa was $450,000
plus an estimated $135 million to be funded through a three-year earn-out
period based on a formula as defined in the agreement. The 2000 and 1999
payment was approximately $453,000 and $689,000, respectively. The effective
date of the acquisition was July 1, 1998. Inquinosa is a worldwide marketer of
the pesticide lindane. Lindane is a preferred seed-treating pesticide that
prevents insect damage during the critical pre-germination stage for wheat,
other grains and canola.
All of the above acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting.
