REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Tenneco Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Tenneco Inc. a Delaware
corporation and consolidated subsidiaries see Note 1 as of December 31, 1998
and 1997, and the related statements of income, cash flows, changes in
shareowners' equity and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1998. These financial statements and the schedule
referred to below are the responsibility of Tenneco Inc. management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Tenneco Inc. and
consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of
their operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in the fourth quarter
of 1997, Tenneco Inc. and consolidated subsidiaries changed their method of
accounting for certain costs incurred in connection with information technology
transformation projects.
Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The supplemental schedule listed in the
index to Part IV, Item 14 relating to Tenneco Inc. and consolidated subsidiaries
is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and is not part of the basic financial statements. The
supplemental schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in
the audits of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states
in all material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements of Tenneco Inc. and consolidated
subsidiaries taken as a whole.

TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Consolidation and Presentation
The financial statements of Tenneco Inc. and consolidated subsidiaries
Tenneco include all majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in 20% to 50%
owned companies where Tenneco has the ability to exert significant influence
over operating and financial policies are carried at cost plus equity in
undistributed earnings since the date of acquisition and cumulative translation
adjustments. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
In December 1996, Tenneco Inc. was spun-off from the company formerly known
as Tenneco Inc. Old Tenneco in a series of transactions the Transaction,
which included distributions the Distributions to Old Tenneco shareowners
and a subsequent merger the Merger. Following the Transaction, Tenneco owned
the automotive parts Automotive, packaging Specialty Packaging and
Paperboard Packaging and administrative services Tenneco Business
Services businesses of Old Tenneco. These transactions and their accounting
treatment are described in more detail in Note 2, Discontinued Operations,
Disposition of Assets, and Extraordinary Loss.
For purposes of these financial statements, Tenneco or the Company
refers to Old Tenneco and its subsidiaries before the Transaction and to Tenneco
Inc., formerly known as New Tenneco Inc. New Tenneco, and its subsidiaries
subsequent to the Transaction.
Changes in Accounting Principles
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards FAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement establishes new
accounting and reporting standards requiring that all derivative instruments
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be
recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its
fair value. The statement requires that changes in the derivative fair value
be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria
are met. Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative gains
and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement
and requires that a company must formally document, designate, and assess the
effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting. This statement
cannot be applied retroactively and is effective for all fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 1999. Tenneco is currently evaluating the new standard but has
not yet determined the impact it will have on its financial position or results
of operations.
In April 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
AICPA issued Statement of Position SOP 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of
Start-Up Activities, which requires costs of start-up activities to be expensed
as incurred. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1998. The statement requires previously capitalized costs related
to start-up activities to be expensed as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle when the statement is adopted. Tenneco capitalizes certain
costs related to start-up activities, primarily engineering costs for new
automobile original equipment platforms. Tenneco expects to record an after-tax
charge for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle upon
adoption of approximately $100 million. Tenneco will adopt this new accounting
principle in the first quarter of 1999.
In March 1998, the AICPA issued SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, which establishes new
accounting and reporting standards for the costs of computer software developed
or obtained for internal use. This statement will be applied prospectively and
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998. The impact of
this new standard will not have a significant effect on Tenneco financial
position or results of operations.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Tenneco adopted FAS No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information, and FAS No. 132, Employers' Disclosures about
Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, in 1998. Disclosures required by
these statements for earlier periods presented have been restated on a
comparative basis.
As required by the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue 97-13,
Accounting for Costs Incurred in Connection with a Consulting Contract that
Combines Business Process Reengineering and Information Technology
Transformation, Tenneco recorded an after-tax charge of $46 million $27 per
common share on both the basic and diluted bases, net of a tax benefit of $28
million, in the fourth quarter of 1997. EITF 97-13 establishes the accounting
treatment and an allocation methodology for certain consulting and other costs
incurred in connection with information technology transformation efforts. This
charge was reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.
Inventories
At December 31, 1998 and 1997, inventory by major classification was as
follows:
1998  1997
MILLIONS
Finished  $484  $467
Work in   139  100
Raw   226  265
Materials and   139  118
$988  $950
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. A portion of total
inventories 49% and 44% at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively is valued
using the last-in, first-out method. All other inventories are valued on the
first-in, first-out FIFO or average methods. If the FIFO or average
method of inventory accounting had been used by Tenneco for all inventories,
inventories would have been $16 million and $45 million higher at December 31,
1998 and 1997, respectively.
Customer Acquisition Costs
Tenneco capitalizes certain costs it incurs in connection with the
acquisition of new customer contracts to sell its automotive aftermarket
products. These new customer acquisition costs are incurred in exchange for
contracts in which the aftermarket customer agrees to purchase Tenneco
automotive aftermarket products exclusively for periods of time ranging up to
three years. These costs are amortized over the initial contract period. At
December 31, 1998 and 1997, the net capitalized costs related to these
activities was $54 million and $47 million, respectively.

Goodwill and Intangibles, net
At December 31, 1998 and 1997, goodwill and intangibles, net of
amortization, by major category were as follows:
1998   1997

Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging
from 20 years to 40 years. Such amortization amounted to $41 million, $36
million, and $21 million for 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively, and is included
in the statements of income caption Depreciation, depletion, and amortization.
Tenneco has capitalized certain intangible assets, primarily trademarks and
patents, based on their estimated fair value at date of acquisition.
Amortization is provided on these intangible assets on a straight-line basis
over periods ranging from 5 to 40 years. Such amortization amounted to $22
million, $24 million, and $26 million in 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively, and
is included in the statements of income caption Depreciation, depletion, and
amortization.
Plant, Property, and Equipment, at Cost
At December 31, 1998 and 1997, plant, property, and equipment, at cost, by
major category was as follows:
1998   1997
MILLIONS
Land, buildings, and  $1,428  $1,371
Machinery and   3,869  3,411
Other, including construction in progress.   440   502
$5,737  $5,284
Depreciation of Tenneco properties is provided on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives range from 10 to 40
years for buildings and improvements and from 3 to 25 years for machinery and
equipment. Depletion of timber and timberlands is provided on a
unit-of-production basis.
Notes Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Short and long-term notes receivable of $88 million and $60 million were
outstanding at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
At December 31, 1998 and 1997, the short and long-term allowance for
doubtful accounts on accounts and notes receivable was $55 million and $35
million, respectively.
Other Long-Term Assets
Tenneco capitalizes certain costs related to start-up activities, primarily
engineering costs for new automobile original equipment platforms, which are
included in the balance sheet caption Other assets -- Other. The platform
engineering costs are amortized over the life of the underlying supply
agreements and
49
54
TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
other start-up costs are amortized over the periods benefited, generally two
years. Start-up costs capitalized, net of amortization, at December 31, 1998 and
1997, were $152 million and $99 million, respectively. Tenneco will adopt a new
accounting standard in the first quarter of 1999, which will require these costs
to be expensed. Refer to Changes in Accounting Principles discussed previously
in this footnote.
Tenneco capitalizes certain costs related to the purchase and development
of software which is used in its business operations. The costs attributable to
these software systems are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on
various factors such as the effects of obsolescence, technology and other
economic factors. Capitalized software development costs, net of amortization,
were $207 million and $151 million at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
As described previously in this footnote, Tenneco will adopt SOP 98-1 regarding
software cost capitalization. The impact of this new standard will not have a
significant effect on Tenneco financial position or results of operations.
Environmental Liabilities
Expenditures for ongoing compliance with environmental regulations that
relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and
that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are expensed.
Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments indicate that remedial
efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Estimates of the
liability are based upon currently available facts, existing technology, and
presently enacted laws and regulations taking into consideration the likely
effects of inflation and other societal and economic factors. All available
evidence is considered including prior experience in remediation of contaminated
sites, other companies' clean-up experience, and data released by the United
States Environmental Protection Agency or other organizations. These estimated
liabilities are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or
new information. These liabilities are included in the balance sheet at their
undiscounted amounts. Recoveries are evaluated separately from the liability
and, when assured, are recorded and reported separately from the associated
liability in the financial statements. For further information on this subject,
refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies.
Income Taxes
Tenneco utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes
whereby it recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax
assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, based upon management
estimates, it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized in a future period. The estimates utilized in the
recognition of deferred tax assets are subject to revision in future periods
based on new facts or circumstances.
Tenneco does not provide for U.S. income taxes on unremitted earnings of
foreign subsidiaries as it is the present intention of management to reinvest
the unremitted earnings in its foreign operations. Unremitted earnings of
foreign subsidiaries are approximately $850 million at December 31, 1998. It is
not practicable to determine the amount of U.S. income taxes that would be
payable upon remittance of the assets that represent those earnings.
Earnings Per Share
According to the requirements of FAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, basic
earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common
shareowners by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. The
computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to the computation of basic
earnings per share except that the weighted-average number of shares outstanding
is adjusted to include estimates of additional shares that would be issued if
potentially dilutive common shares had been issued. In
50
55
TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
addition, income available to common shareowners is adjusted to include any
changes in income or loss that would result from the assumed issuance of the
dilutive common shares.
In 1996, Tenneco preferred stock outstanding before the Merger was
converted into El Paso Natural Gas Company El Paso common stock as part of
the Merger; therefore, preferred stock dividends have been deducted from income
from discontinued operations in determining earnings per share. For more
information regarding the Merger, see Note 2, Discontinued Operations,
Disposition of Assets, and Extraordinary Loss.
Allocation of Corporate Debt and Interest Expense
Tenneco historical practice has been to incur indebtedness for its
consolidated group at the parent company level or at a limited number of
subsidiaries, rather than at the operating company level, and to centrally
manage various cash functions. Consequently, corporate debt of Tenneco
outstanding before the Transaction has been allocated to discontinued operations
based upon the ratio of the discontinued operations' net assets to Tenneco
consolidated net assets plus debt. Interest expense, net of tax, has been
allocated to Tenneco discontinued operations based on the same allocation
methodology. See Note 2, Discontinued Operations, Disposition of Assets, and
Extraordinary Loss, for further discussion regarding the Transaction.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and
development expenses were $58 million, $53 million, and $60 million for 1998,
1997, and 1996, respectively, and are included in the income statement caption
Engineering, research, and development expenses.
Realignment Charges
In 1996, the Company recorded charges of approximately $70 million in
connection with the reorganization of Paperboard Packaging folding carton
operations and the realignment of Automotive: i Walker exhaust system
original equipment and aftermarket manufacturing operations in Europe, ii
Walker aftermarket operations in North America, and iii Monroe ride control
product line. All actions related to the realignment plan have been completed.
Foreign Currency Translation
Financial statements of international operations are translated into U.S.
dollars using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and
liabilities and the weighted average exchange rate for each applicable period
for revenues, expenses, and gains and losses. Translation adjustments are
reflected in the balance sheet caption Accumulated other comprehensive income.
Risk Management Activities
Tenneco uses derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency
forward purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year, to hedge
its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Tenneco primary
exposure to changes in foreign currency rates results from intercompany loans
made between Tenneco affiliates to minimize the need for borrowings from third
parties. Net gains or losses on these foreign currency exchange contracts that
are designated as hedges are recognized in the income statement to offset the
foreign currency gain or loss on the underlying transaction. Additionally,
Tenneco enters into foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts to
mitigate its exposure to changes in exchange rates on intercompany and third
party trade receivables and payables. Since these anticipated transactions are
not firm commitments, Tenneco marks these forward contracts to market each
period and records any gain or loss in the income statement. Tenneco has from
time to time also entered into forward contracts to hedge its net
51
56
TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
investment in foreign subsidiaries. The after-tax net gains or losses on these
contracts are recognized on the accrual basis in the balance sheet caption
Accumulated other comprehensive income. In the statement of cash flows, cash
receipts or payments related to these exchange contracts are classified
consistent with the cash flows from the transaction being hedged.
Tenneco does not currently enter into derivative financial instruments for
speculative purposes.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions in determining the reported amounts of Tenneco assets,
liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Reference is made to the Income Taxes and
Environmental Liabilities sections of this footnote and Notes 11 and 13 for
additional information on significant estimates included in Tenneco financial
statements.
Reclassifications
Prior years' financial statements have been reclassified where appropriate
to conform to 1998 presentations.
2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, DISPOSITION OF ASSETS, AND EXTRAORDINARY LOSS
Strategic Alternatives Analysis
On July 21, 1998, Tenneco announced that its Board of Directors had
authorized management to develop a broad range of strategic alternatives. Among
the options to be considered is the separation of the automotive, containerboard
packaging, and specialty packaging businesses.
On January 26, 1999, Tenneco announced that it had entered into an
agreement to contribute the containerboard assets of its Paperboard Packaging
business into a new joint venture with Madison Dearborn Partners, in exchange
for cash and debt assumption totaling approximately $2 billion, and a 45 percent
common equity interest in the joint venture. These assets represent
substantially all of the assets of the Paperboard Packaging segment and include
four mills, 67 corrugated products plants and an ownership or controlling
interest in approximately 950,000 acres of timberland. Paperboard Packaging
folding carton business is not included in the transaction. In connection with
the transaction, Tenneco Packaging Inc. will borrow approximately $18 billion,
the majority of which will be used to acquire assets used by the containerboard
business pursuant to operating leases and timber cutting rights, with the
remainder remitted to Tenneco for corporate debt reduction. Tenneco Packaging
Inc. will then contribute the containerboard business assets subject to the new
indebtedness and the containerboard business liabilities to a joint venture in
exchange for approximately $240 million in cash and a 45 percent common equity
interest in the joint venture, valued at approximately $200 million. As a result
of the sale transaction, Tenneco expects to recognize a pre-tax loss in 1999 of
approximately $380 million to $395 million. Subject to certain customary closing
conditions, the transaction is expected to close during the first half of 1999.
Subsequent to closing, Tenneco will account for its remaining 45 percent
interest in the containerboard business on the equity method of accounting.
Tenneco continues to analyze the alternatives for Automotive and Specialty
Packaging as well as Paperboard Packaging folding carton business. Those
alternatives include a sale, merger, spin-off or public offering. Tenneco will
make public announcements of the expected transaction as those transactions are
determined.

Discontinued Operations
The Energy Business and Shipbuilding Business
Tenneco Inc. was spun-off from Old Tenneco on December 11, 1996, following
a series of transactions undertaken to realign the assets, liabilities, and
operations of Old Tenneco such that Automotive, Specialty Packaging, Paperboard
Packaging, and Tenneco Business Services were owned by New Tenneco and the
shipbuilding business was owned by Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. Newport
News. On December 11, 1996, Old Tenneco distributed the shares of New Tenneco
and Newport News to its shareowners. On December 12, 1996, Old Tenneco, which
then consisted primarily of the energy business and certain previously
discontinued operations of Old Tenneco, merged with a subsidiary of El Paso
Natural Gas Company El Paso.
Although the separation of Tenneco Inc. from Old Tenneco was structured as
a spin-off for legal, tax, and other reasons, Tenneco Inc. kept certain
important aspects of Old Tenneco, including its executive management, Board of
Directors, and headquarters. Most importantly, the combined assets, revenues,
and operating income of Automotive, Specialty Packaging and Paperboard Packaging
represented more than half the assets, revenues, and operating income of Old
Tenneco before the Distributions and Merger. Consequently, Tenneco Inc.
financial statements for periods before the Distributions and Merger present the
net assets and results of operations of Old Tenneco shipbuilding and energy
businesses, as well as its farm and construction equipment business which was
disposed of before the Distributions and Merger, as discontinued operations.
In connection with the Distributions, one share of New Tenneco common stock
$01 par value was issued for each share of Old Tenneco common stock $500
par value and one share of Newport News common stock was issued for each five
shares of Old Tenneco common stock. Also, in connection with the Merger, Old
Tenneco shareowners received shares of El Paso common stock valued at
approximately $914 million in the aggregate in exchange for their shares of Old
Tenneco common and preferred stock. The treasury shares held by Old Tenneco did
not participate in the Merger and Distributions and were retained by Old Tenneco
in the Merger. Subsequent to the Transaction, the common equity of Tenneco Inc.
relates solely to the shares of New Tenneco common stock issued in the
Distributions. In connection with the Transaction, the retained earnings
accumulated deficit of Old Tenneco was eliminated. Retained earnings
accumulated deficit shown on the balance sheets represents net earnings
losses accumulated after the date of the Transaction. The effects of the
issuance of New Tenneco common stock in the Distributions, the retention of
treasury shares by Old Tenneco, and the elimination of Old Tenneco retained
earnings accumulated deficit have been reflected in the statements of changes
in shareowners' equity as Recapitalization of New Tenneco.
Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1996, for the energy
business were as follows:

On December 11, 1996, one day before the Merger, Old Tenneco completed the
distribution of the common stock of Newport News to the holders of Old Tenneco
common stock. As part of the Distributions, Newport News retained the net assets
of the shipbuilding business, including approximately $600 million of debt that
had been issued during November 1996.
Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1996, for the

The costs incurred to complete the Transaction, consisting primarily of
financial advisory, legal, accounting, printing, and other costs, of
approximately $108 million, net of a $17 million income tax benefit, were
recorded as a component of 1996 income from discontinued operations.
Farm and Construction Equipment Operations
In June 1994, Tenneco completed an initial public offering IPO of
approximately 29% of the common stock of Case Corporation Case, the holder
of Tenneco farm and construction equipment segment. In November 1994, a
secondary offering of Case common stock reduced Tenneco ownership interest in
Case to approximately 44%. Combined proceeds from the two transactions was $694
million, net of commissions and offering expenses. The combined gain on the
transactions was $36 million, including a $7 million tax benefit. In an August
1995 public offering, Tenneco sold an additional 161 million shares of Case
common stock for net proceeds of approximately $540 million. The sale resulted
in a gain of $101 million and reduced Tenneco ownership in Case from 44% to
21%. In December 1995, Tenneco sold to a third party a subordinated note
receivable due from Case, which was received as part of the reorganization
preceding the Case IPO, for net proceeds of $298 million and recognized a gain
of $32 million. In March 1996, Tenneco sold its remaining 152 million shares of
common stock of Case in a public offering. Net proceeds of approximately $788
million were received, resulting in a gain of $340 million, net of $83 million
in income tax expense.

Disposition of Assets
In the second quarter of 1996, Paperboard Packaging entered into an
agreement to form a joint venture with Caraustar Industries whereby Paperboard
Packaging sold its two recycled paperboard mills and a fiber recycling operation
and brokerage business to the joint venture in return for cash and an equity
interest in the joint venture. Proceeds from the sale were approximately $115
million and the Company recognized a $50 million pre-tax gain in the second
quarter of 1996. Paperboard Packaging sold its remaining interest in the joint
venture and recognized a $15 million pre-tax gain in the second quarter of 1998.
In addition, Paperboard Packaging recognized a $17 million pre-tax gain on the
sale of non-strategic timberland assets in the third quarter of 1998.
Gains and losses on the sale of businesses and assets have been included in
the caption Other income, net in the accompanying statements of income.
Extraordinary Loss
In preparation for the Transaction, Old Tenneco realigned $38 billion of
indebtedness the Debt Realignment through various cash tender offers, debt
exchanges, defeasances, and other retirements. The cash funding required to
consummate the Debt Realignment was financed through internally generated cash,
borrowings under new credit facilities of both Old Tenneco and New Tenneco,
borrowings under a new credit facility and other financings at Newport News, and
proceeds from the issuance of 8 1/4% cumulative junior preferred stock NPS
Preferred Stock, which was retained by Old Tenneco in the Merger. As a result
of the Merger, El Paso indirectly acquired approximately $28 billion of debt
and preferred stock obligations as well as certain liabilities related to
operations previously discontinued by Old Tenneco.
As a result of the Debt Realignment, Tenneco recognized an extraordinary
loss of approximately $236 million, net of a tax benefit of approximately $126
million. This extraordinary loss consists principally of the fair value paid in
the cash tender offers and the fair value of debt exchanged in the debt exchange
offers in excess of the historical net carrying value for the debt tendered and
exchanged.
3. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES
On July 21, 1998, Tenneco announced its intention to initiate a
restructuring plan designed to reduce administrative and operational overhead
costs in every part of Tenneco business. In the fourth quarter of
55
60
TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
1998, Tenneco Board of Directors approved an extensive restructuring plan to
accomplish the overhead reduction goals as well as to consolidate the
manufacturing and distribution operations of Automotive North American
aftermarket business and certain manufacturing operations in the Paperboard
Packaging and Specialty Packaging businesses. Tenneco recorded a pre-tax charge
of $100 million, $64 million after-tax or 38 cents per share, in the fourth
quarter of 1998 related to this restructuring plan. Of the pre-tax charge, for
operational restructuring actions, $36 million is related to the Automotive
aftermarket restructuring, $10 million is related to the Specialty Packaging
restructuring, and $10 million is related to the Paperboard Packaging
restructuring. The staff and related cost reduction plan, which covers staff
reductions at both the operating units and at corporate, is expected to cost $44
million. The charge was recognized in the results of operations for each segment
where the costs will be incurred. Including the charges for the staff and
related cost reductions, Automotive recorded a charge of $53 million, Specialty
Packaging a charge of $18 million, Paperboard Packaging a charge of $17 million
and Tenneco corporate operations a charge of $12 million.
The Automotive aftermarket restructuring involves closing two plant
locations and five distribution centers and the elimination of 302 positions at
those locations. The Paperboard Packaging restructuring plan involves closing
four box plants and the elimination of 78 positions at those plants. The
Specialty Packaging restructuring plan involves the elimination of production
lines at two plants and the closure of one plant. Additionally, Specialty
Packaging will exit four joint ventures. These actions involve the elimination
of 104 positions. The staff and related cost reduction plan involves the
elimination of 834 administrative positions in Tenneco three business units
and its corporate operations.
The fixed assets at the locations to be closed and for the production lines
to be eliminated, as well as the joint venture investments, were written down to
their estimated fair value. No significant cash proceeds are expected to be
received from the ultimate disposal of these assets.
As of December 31, 1998, approximately 500 employees had been terminated
pursuant to the restructuring plan.
Amounts related to the restructuring plan are shown in the following table:

Tenneco expects the balance of the restructuring liability will be expended
during 1999 and that the restructuring actions will be complete by the fourth
quarter of 1999.
4. ACQUISITIONS
In 1998, Tenneco made three acquisitions in the Specialty Packaging
business and one in the Automotive business for approximately $101 million and
$3 million, respectively.
In March 1997, Tenneco entered into an agreement to acquire the protective
and flexible packaging division of NV Koninklijke KNP BT KNP, a Dutch
distribution, paper, and packaging firm, for approximately $380 million
including debt assumed and preferred stock of a subsidiary issued to a seller.
Upon completion of the KNP acquisition in late April 1997, KNP became a part of
Specialty Packaging. Also during 1997, Tenneco completed acquisitions or
investments in other businesses and joint ventures, principally in the
automotive parts industry, for total consideration of approximately $38 million.

TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
In June 1996, Tenneco entered into agreements to acquire Clevite for $328
million and Amoco Foam Products for $310 million. Clevite makes suspension
bushings and other elastomeric parts for cars and trucks. Upon completion of the
Clevite acquisition in July 1996, Clevite operations became part of
Automotive. Amoco Foam Products manufactures expanded polystyrene tableware,
hinged-lid food containers, packaging trays, and industrial products for
residential and commercial construction applications. Tenneco closed the
acquisition of Amoco Foam Products in August 1996, and Amoco Foam Products
became part of Specialty Packaging. Also during 1996, Tenneco completed the
acquisitions of or investments in various other businesses and joint ventures,
principally in the automotive parts industry, for total consideration of
approximately $110 million.
All of the acquisitions discussed above have been accounted for as
purchases; accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the assets
purchased and the liabilities assumed based on their fair values. The excess of
the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is included in
the balance sheet caption Goodwill and intangibles, net.

b Tenneco committed long-term credit facilities support its
commercial paper borrowings; consequently, the amount available under
the committed long-term credit facilities is reduced by outstanding
commercial paper borrowings.
At December 31, 1998, Tenneco principal credit facility, which expires in
2001, was a $175 billion committed financing arrangement with a syndicate of
banks and other financial institutions. Committed borrowings under this credit
facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at the borrower option,
either i a rate consisting of the higher of Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of
New York prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points; ii a
rate of LIBOR plus a margin determined based on the credit rating of Tenneco
long-term debt; or iii a rate based on money market rates pursuant to
competitive bids by the syndicate banks.
The credit facility requires that the Company consolidated ratio of debt
to total capitalization, as defined in the credit facility, not exceed 70%.
Compliance with this requirement is a condition for any incremental borrowings
under the credit facility and failure to meet the requirement enables the
syndicate banks to require repayment of any outstanding loans after a 30-day
cure period. At December 31, 1998, Tenneco ratio of debt to total
capitalization as defined in the credit facility was 579%. In addition, the
credit

facility imposes certain other restrictions, none of which are expected to limit
the Company ability to operate its business in the ordinary course.

potential tax benefits of $38 million and $29 million at December 31, 1998 and
1997, respectively, which were not recognized in the statements of income when
generated. These unrecognized tax benefits resulted primarily from foreign tax
loss carryforwards which are available to reduce future foreign tax liabilities.
Of the $568 million of U.S. tax loss carryforwards which exist at December
31, 1998, $354 million expire in 2012 and $214 million expire in 2018. The $192
million of state tax loss carryforwards which exist at December 31, 1998, will
expire in varying amounts over the period from 2000 to 2012. Of the $185 million
of foreign tax loss carryforwards which exist at December 31, 1998, $136 million
do not expire and the remainder expires in varying amounts over the period from
1999 to 2008.
In connection with the corporate reorganization transactions discussed in
Note 2, Discontinued Operations, Disposition of Assets, and Extraordinary
Loss, Tenneco entered into a tax sharing agreement

TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
with Newport News, Old Tenneco, and El Paso. The tax sharing agreement provides,
among other things, for the allocation among the parties of tax liabilities
arising before, as a result of, and after the Distributions. For periods after
the Distributions, Tenneco will be liable for taxes imposed on its businesses,
Old Tenneco will be liable for taxes imposed on the energy business, and Newport
News will be liable for taxes imposed on the shipbuilding business. In the case
of federal income taxes imposed on the activities of the Old Tenneco
consolidated group before the Distributions, Tenneco and Newport News are
generally liable to Old Tenneco for federal income taxes attributable to their
respective businesses, and those entities have been allocated an agreed-upon
share of estimated tax payments made by Old Tenneco.
8. COMMON STOCK
Tenneco Inc. has authorized 350 million shares $01 par value of common

2,928,189 shares of treasury stock at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
Stock Repurchase Plans
During 1997, Tenneco initiated a common stock repurchase program to acquire
up to 85 million shares. Approximately 75 million shares have been acquired
under this program at a total cost of approximately $289 million. All purchases
executed through this program were in the open market or negotiated purchases.

Stock Plans
Tenneco Inc. Stock Ownership Plan -- In December 1996, Tenneco adopted the
1996 Stock Ownership Plan, which permits the granting of a variety of awards,
including common stock, restricted stock, performance shares, stock appreciation
rights SARs, and stock options to directors, officers, and employees of
Tenneco. Tenneco can issue up to 17,000,000 shares of common stock under the
1996 Stock Ownership Plan, which will terminate December 31, 2001. All Old
Tenneco stock options granted to New Tenneco employees before the Distributions
were, in connection with the Distributions, cancelled and replaced with options
to purchase New Tenneco common stock according to the provisions of the 1996
Stock Ownership Plan. The options were replaced with the appropriate number of
New Tenneco options so that the aggregate option value immediately after the
Distributions equaled the aggregate value immediately before the Distributions.
The 1994 Stock Ownership Plan was terminated effective as of December 11, 1996.

Restricted Stock and Performance Shares -- Tenneco has granted restricted
stock and restricted units under the 1996 Stock Ownership Plan to certain key
employees. These awards generally require, among other things, that the employee
remain an employee of Tenneco during the restriction period. Tenneco has also
granted performance shares to certain key employees which will vest based upon
the attainment of specified performance goals within four years from the date of
grant. During 1998, 1997, and 1996, Tenneco granted 640,810, 494,350, and
465,075 shares and units, respectively, with a weighted average fair value based
on the price of Tenneco stock on the grant date of $3803, $4308, and $4854
per share, respectively. Any restricted stock and performance shares awarded
after the Distributions are issued under the 1996 Stock Ownership Plan. At
December 31, 1998, 351,220 restricted shares at an average price of $3776 per
share, 562,145 performance shares at an average price of $4135 per share, and
31,000 restricted units at an average price of $3772 per unit were outstanding
under this plan.
Under another arrangement, restricted stock or restricted units are issued
annually to each member of the Board of Directors who is not also an officer of
Tenneco. From January 1, 1996, through October 31, 1996, 3,300 restricted shares
were issued with a weighted average fair value based on the price of Tenneco
stock on the grant date of $4825 per share. On November 1, 1996, all
outstanding restricted shares were vested. In December 1996, Tenneco adopted a
new restricted stock and unit plan for each member of the Board of Directors who
is not also an officer of Tenneco. During 1998, 1997, and 1996, 1,700, 5,040,
and 23,464 restricted shares and units, respectively, were issued under the new
plan at a weighted average fair value of Tenneco Inc. stock on the grant date
of $3731, $4519, and $4531 per share, respectively. At December 31, 1998,
27,696 restricted shares at an average price of $4480 per share and 300
restricted units at an average price of $4519 per unit were outstanding under
the new plan.
In conjunction with the Transaction, all outstanding restricted shares and
performance shares as of November 1, 1996, were vested and Tenneco recognized an
after-tax compensation expense of $18 million, of which approximately $7 million
related to restricted stock and performance shares awarded to employees of the
energy business and shipbuilding business.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan -- In June 1992, Tenneco initiated an Employee
Stock Purchase Plan the 1992 ESPP. The 1992 ESPP was terminated as of the
date of the Distributions. Effective April 1, 1997, Tenneco adopted a new ESPP
with provisions similar to the 1992 ESPP. The ESPP allows U.S. and Canadian
Tenneco employees to purchase Tenneco Inc. common stock at a 15% discount. Each
year employees participating in the ESPP may purchase shares with a discounted
value not to exceed $21,250. Under the respective ESPPs, Tenneco sold 613,195,
244,768, and 657,936 shares to employees in 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively.
The weighted average fair value of the employee purchase right, which was
estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the assumptions
described below except that the average life of each purchase right was assumed
to be 90 days, was $631, $1116, and $1084 in 1998, 1997, and 1996,
respectively.

Tenneco applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, to account for its stock-based compensation plans.
Tenneco recognized after-tax stock-based compensation expense in 1998 of $3
million, in 1997 of $5 million, and in 1996 of $27 million, of which $9 million
related to restricted stock and performance shares awarded to employees of the
energy business and the shipbuilding business. Had compensation costs for
Tenneco stock-based compensation plans been determined in accordance with FAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, based on the fair value at
the grant dates for the awards under those plans, Tenneco pro forma net income
to common stock and earnings per share of common stock for the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996, would have been lower by $33 million or $19
per both basic and diluted common share, $34 million or $20 per both basic and
diluted common share, and $14 million or $08 per both basic and diluted common
share, respectively. The increase in compensation expense for 1997 versus 1996
was primarily the result of stock options issued subsequent to the Transaction.

Stock Employee Compensation Trust SECT
In November 1992, Tenneco established the SECT to fund a portion of its
obligations arising from its various employee compensation and benefit plans.
Tenneco issued 12 million shares of treasury stock to the SECT in exchange for a
promissory note of $432 million that accrued interest at the rate of 78% per
annum. At December 31, 1996, all shares had been utilized.
Grantor Trust
In August 1998, Tenneco established a grantor trust and issued 19 million
shares of common stock to the trust. This grantor trust is a so-called rabbi
trust designed to assure the payment of deferred compensation and supplemental
pension benefits. The trust is consolidated in Tenneco financial statements
and the shares are reflected in the financial statements as treasury stock.
Consequently, the shares of common stock issued to the trust are not considered
to be outstanding in the computation of earnings per share.
Qualified Offer Rights Plan
On September 9, 1998, Tenneco adopted a Qualified Offer Rights Plan and
established an independent Board committee to review it every three years. The
Qualified Offer Rights Plan was adopted to deter coercive takeover tactics and
to prevent a potential acquiror from gaining control of Tenneco in a transaction
which is not in the best interests of Tenneco shareholders. Generally, under the
Qualified Offer Rights Plan, if a person becomes the beneficial owner of 20
percent or more of Tenneco outstanding common stock, other than pursuant to a
qualified offer, each right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the
right exercise price, a number of shares of common stock of Tenneco or, under
certain circumstances, of the acquiring person having a market value of twice
the right exercise price. Rights held by the 20 percent or more holder will
become void and will not be exercisable.
The rights will not become exercisable in connection with a qualified
offer, which is an all-cash tender offer for all outstanding common stock that
is fully financed, remains open for a period of at least 60 business days,
results in the offeror owning at least 85% of the common stock after
consummation of the offer, assures a prompt second-step acquisition of shares
not purchased in the initial offer, at the same price as the initial offer, and
meets certain other requirements.
In connection with the adoption of the Qualified Offer Rights Plan, the
Board of Directors also adopted a three-year independent director evaluation
TIDE mechanism. Under the TIDE mechanism, an independent Board committee
will review, on an ongoing basis, the Qualified Offer Rights Plan and
developments in rights plans generally, and, if it deems appropriate, recommend
modification or termination of the Qualified Offer Rights Plan. The independent
committee will report to Tenneco Board at least every three years as to
whether the Qualified Offer Rights Plan continues to be in the best interests of
Tenneco shareholders.
Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
Under the Tenneco Inc. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan,
holders of Tenneco Inc. common stock may apply their cash dividends and optional
cash investments to the purchase of additional shares of Tenneco Inc. common
stock.

- Notes: a All preferred stock outstanding before the Merger was acquired by El
Paso. Therefore, preferred stock dividends were included in the
computation of earnings per share from discontinued operations for
1996. There was no preferred stock outstanding in 1998 or 1997.
b In 1992, 12 million shares of common stock were issued to the SECT.
Shares of common stock issued to a related trust are not considered
to be outstanding in the computation of average shares until the
shares are used to fund the obligations of the trust. During the year
ended December 31, 1996, the SECT used 4,358,084 shares. At December
31, 1996, all shares were used. Stock repurchase plans also affect
common stock outstanding. Refer to Stock Employee Compensation Trust
SECT and Stock Repurchase Plans discussed previously in this
footnote.
9. PREFERRED STOCK
Tenneco had 50 million shares of preferred stock $01 par value
authorized at December 31, 1998 and 1997. No shares of preferred stock were
outstanding at the respective dates. Tenneco has designated and reserved 20
million shares of the preferred stock as junior preferred stock for the
Qualified Offer Rights Plan.
As part of the Merger, Tenneco $740 and $450 preferred stock the
Preferred Stock was acquired by El Paso in exchange for El Paso common stock.
Consequently, Preferred Stock dividends have been subtracted from discontinued
operations to compute basic and diluted earnings per share. Before the Merger,
Tenneco made periodic accretions of the excess of the redemption value over the
fair value of the Preferred Stock at the date of issue. Such accretions have
been included in the statements of income caption, Preferred stock dividends
as a reduction of net income to arrive at net income to common stock.
In connection with the Transaction and as part of the Debt Realignment, Old
Tenneco issued the NPS Preferred Stock in November 1996 for proceeds of
approximately $296 million. The proceeds from the
66

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
issuance were used to fund a portion of the cash tender offers made in
connection with the Debt Realignment and other cash requirements preceding the
Merger. As a result of the Merger, the obligations relating to the NPS Preferred
Stock remained with Old Tenneco.

10. MINORITY INTEREST
At December 31, 1998 and 1997, Tenneco reported minority interest in the
balance sheet of $421 million and $424 million, respectively. At December 31,
1998, $394 million of minority interest resulted from the December 1994 and
December 1997 sales of preferred stock $300 million and $100 million,
respectively of Tenneco International Holding Corp. TIHC to a financial
investor. Subsequent to each sale, the investor had approximately a 25% interest
in TIHC, consisting of 100% of the issued and outstanding variable rate voting
preferred stock of TIHC. Tenneco and certain of its subsidiaries hold 100% of
the issued and outstanding $800 junior preferred stock and common stock of
TIHC. TIHC holds certain assets including the capital stock of Alupack A.G., a
subsidiary included in the Specialty Packaging segment, Tenneco Canada Inc.,
S.A. Monroe Europe N.V., Monroe Australia Proprietary Limited, Walker France
S.A., and other subsidiaries included in the Automotive segment. For financial
reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, and earnings of TIHC and its
subsidiaries are consolidated in Tenneco financial statements, and the
investor preferred stock interest has been recorded as Minority interest in
the balance sheet.
As of December 31, 1998, dividends on the TIHC preferred stock are based on
the aggregate issue price of $400 million times a rate per annum equal to 92%
over LIBOR and are payable quarterly in arrears on the last business day of each
quarter. The weighted average rate paid on TIHC preferred stock was 666 692%, and 683% for 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively. Additionally, the
holder of the preferred stock is entitled to receive, when and if declared by
the Board of Directors of TIHC, participating dividends based on the operating
income growth rate of TIHC and its subsidiaries. For financial reporting
purposes, dividends paid by TIHC to its financial investor have been recorded in
Tenneco statements of income as Minority interest.
11. PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
Tenneco has pension plans that cover substantially all of its employees.
Benefits are based on years of service and, for most salaried employees, on
final average compensation. Tenneco funding policies are to contribute to the
plans amounts necessary to satisfy the funding requirement of federal laws and
regulations. Plan assets consist principally of listed equity and fixed income
securities. Also included in the table below are pension obligations and assets
retained by Tenneco related to certain employees of Tenneco discontinued
operations.
Tenneco has postretirement health care and life insurance plans that cover
a majority of its domestic employees. For salaried employees, the plans cover
employees retiring from Tenneco on or after attaining age 55 who have had at
least 10 years service with Tenneco after attaining age 45. For hourly
employees, the
67
72
TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
postretirement benefit plans generally cover employees who retire according to
one of Tenneco hourly employee retirement plans. All of these benefits may be
subject to deductibles, copayment provisions, and other limitations, and Tenneco
has reserved the right to change these benefits. Tenneco postretirement
benefit plans are not funded.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair
value of plan assets for all pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations
in excess of plan assets were $203 million, $191 million, and $95 million,
respectively, as of September 30, 1998, and $52 million, $50 million, and $10
million, respectively, as of September 30, 1997.
The weighted average discount rates which are based on long-term market
rates used in determining the 1998, 1997, and 1996 actuarial present value of
the benefit obligations were 70%, 775%, and 775%, respectively. The rate of
increase in future compensation was 48%, 50%, and 50%, for 1998, 1997, and
1996, respectively. The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets for 1998, 1997, and 1996 was 100% for each year.
Net periodic postretirement benefit cost from continuing operations for the
years 1998, 1997, and 1996 consist of the following components:
1998     1997     1996

The initial weighted average assumed health care cost trend rate used in
determining the 1998, 1997, and 1996 accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation was 5%, 5%, and 6%, respectively, declining to 5% in 1997 and
remaining at that level thereafter.
Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point
in each year would increase the 1998, 1997, and 1996 accumulated postretirement
benefit obligations by approximately $15 million, $14 million, and $13 million,
respectively, and would increase the aggregate of the service cost and interest
cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost by approximately
$2 million each year for 1998, 1997, and 1996.
Decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point
in each year would decrease the 1998 accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation by approximately $14 million and would decrease the aggregate of
service cost and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement
benefit cost by $2 million.

13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Capital Commitments
Tenneco estimates that expenditures aggregating approximately $305 million
will be required after December 31, 1998, to complete facilities and projects
authorized at such date, and substantial commitments have been made in
connection therewith. Of this amount, $49 million is in support of the
containerboard business, which Tenneco has reached an agreement to sell. See
Note 2, Discontinued Operations, Disposition of Assets, and Extraordinary
Loss.
Lease Commitments
Tenneco holds certain of its facilities, equipment, and other assets under
long-term leases. Excluding certain leases held by Tenneco containerboard
business, the minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases with
lease terms in excess of one year are $69 million, $55 million, $43 million, $34
million, and $72 million for the years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003,
respectively, and $150 million for subsequent years.
Tenneco containerboard business holds certain mill and timberland assets
under operating leases with financial investors the Lessor. In connection
with the pending sale of the containerboard business described in Note 2 to
these financial statements, Tenneco may purchase the mill and timberland assets
prior to the sale. At December 31, 1998, minimum lease payments under the
containerboard leases are $68 million for the years 1999, 2000, and 2001, $18
million for the years 2002 and 2003, and $34 million for subsequent years.
Following the initial mill asset lease period, Tenneco may, under the
provisions of the lease agreements, extend the leases on terms mutually
negotiated with the Lessor or purchase the leased assets under conditions
specified in the lease agreements. If the purchase options are not exercised or
the leases are not extended,
72
77
TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Tenneco will make a residual guarantee payment to the Lessor of approximately
$658 million, which will be refunded up to the total amount of the residual
guarantee payment based on the Lessor subsequent sales price for the leased
assets. Throughout the lease period, Tenneco is required to maintain the leased
properties.
In January 1997, Tenneco refinanced two mill asset leases resulting in a
pre-tax gain of $38 million which is included in the caption Other income,
net.
Commitments under capital leases were not significant to the accompanying
financial statements. Total rental expense for continuing operations for the
years 1998, 1997, and 1996, was $163 million, $163 million, and $179 million,
respectively, including minimum rentals under non-cancelable operating leases of
$139 million, $155 million, and $151 million for the corresponding periods.
Certain of Tenneco Packaging Inc. various lease agreements, all related
to the containerboard business, require that it complies with certain covenants
and restrictions, including financial ratios that, among other things, place
limitations on incurring additional funded debt as defined by the agreements.
Under the provisions of the timber lease agreements, and subsequent amendments,
in order to incur funded debt, Tenneco Packaging Inc. must maintain a pre-tax
cash flow coverage ratio, as defined, on a cumulative four quarter basis of a
minimum of 175, 200, and 125 at December 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996,
respectively. Tenneco Packaging Inc. was in compliance with all of its covenants
at December 31, 1998.
Litigation
Tenneco Inc. and Newport News have received letters from the Defense
Contract Audit Agency the DCAA, inquiring about certain aspects of the
Distributions, including the disposition of the Tenneco Inc. Retirement Plan
TRP, which covers salaried employees of Newport News and other Tenneco
divisions and the 1986 asset valuation for the TRP and its cost accounting
treatment. On January 15, 1999, Newport News entered into a settlement agreement
with the Federal Government regarding the TRP. Tenneco agreed to pay Newport
News $145 million with respect to this and other matters. This payment had no
material impact on Tenneco financial position or results of operations.
Tenneco Inc. and its subsidiaries are parties to various other legal
proceedings arising from their operations. Tenneco believes that the outcome of
these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will have no material
effect on the financial position or results of operations of Tenneco Inc. and
its subsidiaries.
Environmental Matters
Tenneco Inc. and its subsidiaries are subject to a variety of environmental
and pollution control laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which they
operate. Tenneco has provided reserves for compliance with these laws and
regulations where it is probable that a liability exists and where Tenneco can
make a reasonable estimate of the liability. The estimated liabilities recorded
are subject to change as more information becomes available regarding the
magnitude of possible clean-up costs and the timing, varying costs, and
effectiveness of alternative clean-up technologies. However, Tenneco believes
that any additional costs which arise as more information becomes available will
not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations
of Tenneco.
